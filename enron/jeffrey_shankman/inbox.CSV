"FW: Georgia Power Rate Case","Mike and Jeff:  

Yesterday, Harry Kingerski from Government Affairs testified before the Georgia state commission, advocating the use and benefits of weather derivatives.  Harry heads up our rates/technical division within Government Affairs - he has excellent technical skills and is very highly regarded by state commissioners nationwide.  I wanted to report back to you that Harry received very positive feedback from various groups attending the hearing.  He commented to me this morning that the Commissioners were very attentive when he discussed weather products, and basically snoozed through the remainder of the hearing!!  He has recommended to Mark's group that we talk directly to the Commissioners (outside of the litigation process) to further educate them on our products.     

We are also advocating weather products in other state proceedings, as opportunities arise.  All of this work is being done internally within Government Affairs, drawing upon various areas of expertise.   

We will keep plugging away, but wanted you to know that, so far, we are getting good feedback!!

Subject:	Georgia Power Rate Case

Yesterday, we were cross-examined on our testimony at hearings before the Georgia Public Service Commission.  One of the main points in our testimony was that Georgia Power should be required to use weather hedges to mitigate weather-related volume risk.  We made the point that hedges would be superior to the revenue sharing approach proposed by Georgia Power, and could save customers significant amounts of money.

Although a final PSC decision isn't scheduled until early in December, there were a couple of positive signs at the hearing.  Several othere intervenors, including Commission staff, talked to us informally about the idea and seemed to see benefit in the weather hedging approach.  Also, the 4 commissioners seemed particularly attentive when we described the weather issue during the hearing (a noticeable difference, compared to their attention on most issues).

We may have opportunity to visit informally with the commissioners later in November.  If we can arrange it, would one of you be interested in giving a brief overview of the weather market and the participants (the on-the-shelf presentation you have would be fine)?   This could help with their final decision.

On a different front, we are planning an intervention in a Gulf Power rate case in Florida to promote weather hedging.  Bob and I think the issues there are similar.  Our due date for testimony there is early in December. 

Thanks to each of you for helping us prepare the materials for these cases.

"Enron Japan deal pipeline","Mike/Jeff:

Attached is the updated EJ deal pipeline report following Joe's note below. This is updated daily by the Originators here, so excuse some rough edges. I believe we've made good progress in our 1st Qtr in EGM; progress on accessing a diverse universe of target EGM customers, identifying customer needs, building a deal list, advancing / closing out documentation, developing RAC's understanding of our business and now quoting firm prices. This report + the traction we're beginning to achieve in the market here supports the budget numbers you discussed with Joe earlier today. 

To reflect the Sato initiative which we're running independently of the Origination focus,  separate pages reflecting this have been added.

Happy to take questions.

Regards - Jeremy

Subject: Sato MOU and Deal List

Mike/Jeff, 
Jeremy will be sending you the updated internal deal list to give you a feel for the types of things we are working on and where we stand. We'd like to discuss this further with you. I think you will see from the types of transactions and the relative value that the 2002 plan numbers are not unrealistic. However, in order to achieve these numbers will require some strong support from Houston and additional expat staff. We have focused on reasonableness of the size of transactions that we are seeing to date and what we would additionally plan to see. We have also focused on trying to do more with less (Sato proposition) and shooting for just north of break even. Additionally, I am under the belief that you are stretching all of the groups and anything less than covering costs would not be acceptable. While Sato would not be required to achieve these numbers, it would certainly be easier with them. (... don't mean for this to be interpreted that we should have higher numbers with Sato...). 
Sato: 
We'd like to set a time to speak with you about Sato MOU your Thursday (our Friday). Our 0730 is your 1730. Would this work for you? 
Joe

"Re: Update","Jeff-
I was going through my emails when I came across one from you to
which I never responded. A few days after you asked if I was working
with anthrax, I was whisked to DCv on a charter flight to assist with
the investigation there.
It was an amazing and intense experience during which I learned a
tremendous amount. It was very different being a part of a team, as
opposed to directing an investigation. I unfortunately did not have
much time to explore DC, although we were staying in a very nice part
of Dupont Circle. I am happy to be back in Atlanta (where I have been
for only 3 weeks since July). I still have quite a bit of work to
complete related to the investigation before letting the rest of the
team make their advice, suggestions, and contributions.
How have you been? I read briefly that Enron was having some tough
times. Did this affect you directly, or were the happenings in
another division?
Are you going back to Louisville for Thanksgiving or will you be
traveling? I will be here in Atlanta, working, and hopefully taking a
couple of hours off to enjoy a little turkey nwith friends.
The PennAtlanta alumni club will be holding an holiday party in 2
weeks which I hope to attend if I am in town. I know 2 other other
Penn-Atlanta couples, so perhaps it will be a good way to reconnect
with some people. Does Houston have any similar events?
I hope that things are going well for you. I will be an aunt by the
time that I will next speak to you!!!!
Best,
andi

"API Forecasts","Jeff,

Please accept my apologies for the slight delay in getting back to you on the message board regarding this week's API forecast.  I'd like to take a minute of your time to highlight what we are doing to address all our concerns over our forecasts and how we are actively seeking to produce better results that we are all comfortable with and that provide useful insight and tradable information to our colleagues on the trading desks.

As I am sure you know, forecasting the API's is not as scientific as other industry data such as the AGA's.  The API is not consistently clear as to how it measures crude demand and this week's data is  a clear example of this in that there is a discrepancy of 1.2 million b/d between crude runs and the demand figure shown by the API.  Each week the basis of measuring crude demand changes slightly.  To address this we are looking at finding ways of predicting what we call the API Curve Ball Factor through a  variety of regressions / moving averages analysis.

The second area we are in the process of perfecting is imports data.  We are working closely with IT and Net Works to scrape real time shipping information in order to give us a better handle on crude coming in to the country.  We are also recruiting a Quants PhD from Vince Kaminski's group who will be able to bring a slightly more scientific skill set to our team of business / economics skill sets.

Please be assured that this issue is one we are giving the utmost priority to addressing.  Having only recently taken on responsibility for the crude and products fundamentals team I have not had much opportunity to discuss issues with you.  Please be assured that I am available at any time to discuss this, or any other, issue with you.

Best regards,
Andrew Hill.

"Enron does its first yen based crude trade","Mike/Jeff,
 
As indicated in the list of deals and interested cps that we sent you yesterday, we closed a transaction with Japanese trading company, Kobayashi Yoko, this afternoon.  Kinoshita and Anai had been working this company and had already gotten basic documentation and credit approval in place.  We had also gotten prior approval from Sheila Glover and Gary Hickerson to use the local metal's trader to handle FX swaps up to USD30MM.  Commodity and FX risk (except for 4 days from contract settlement) have been hedged with Singapore and ENA.  Not a big deal in and of itself (notional USD250k), but a start.  We believe there is much more demand and plan to see more in the near future.  Also expect to see first LPG deal with Marubeni with our new mid mkt ""trader"" very shortly.  We would back to back transaction as well.  Details of this transaction are as follows:
 
Enron Japan sells Dubai swap to Enron Singapore

Month: March 2002

Volume: 12,500bbls

Price: 20.24$/bbl

Enron Japan sells US$253,000 to ENA

Value date: 5 April 2002

Price: 118.92Y/$

Enron Japan buys Dubai swap from Kobayashi Yoko

Wharton Connect
December 2001						Volume 1     Issue 2


Dear Alumni:

In a year of great change in the world, Wharton alumni have come together as never before.  In my position as Associate Dean, I have held a unique vantage point in seeing how you have helped and supported one another personally and professionally in good times and difficult ones.

I would ask you to consider yet another way that you could make an impact on the Wharton network.  As you can imagine, in the current economy, it has been especially challenging for our students as they embark on their job searches.  We are about to embark on a new mentoring program in the School, which will bring current and future alumni together.  Please read the story below for more details about how you could help in this effort next year.

As 2001 draws to a close, let me take the opportunity to wish you and yours a very happy holiday season and a prosperous New Year.

Sincerely,
Steven Oliveira
Associate Dean

Wharton [Connect]: On the Road Again!

On October 24, the largest group of alumni yet came together for a Wharton [Connect] (http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/alumni/connect/index.html) event.  Close to 300 alumni gathered at the Menlo Circus Club in Atherton, CA to hear the latest developments at the School from Dean Pat Harker.  Jon Huntsman, W'59, Chairman of the Board of Overseers, shared his thoughts about staying active with the Wharton network.   John Dean, WG'74, and the Wharton Club of Northern California were co-hosts of the evening along with the School.

In addition, Dean Harker met with alumni and other business leaders in Mumbai, India in November in two very well attended events.   The first was a panel discussion entitled, ""The Challenges of Leading in Turbulent Times,"" which was carried by CNBC in India and parts of Asia.  The Dean also met with alumni and parents of students for a special briefing over lunch.  Wharton's network in this part of the world is strong, and enthusiasm for the School's initiatives runs very high.

These events were part of almost 30 Wharton [Connect] events Wharton will host over the next 18 months in order to bring alumni closer to one another and to the School.  The next events will be in Miami on Thursday, January 10; Palm Beach on January 12;  Monterrey, Mexico on January 15; and Hong Kong on January 22. Visit the Wharton [Connect] website (http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/alumni/connect/index.html) to see pictures of previous events, as well as learn more about when a Wharton [Connect] event may be coming to your city.

New Mentoring Program for Future Alumni

Graduates of the School and ""future alumni"" are about to be linked in a new program that will connect generations within the Wharton experience.

More details will be sent shortly, but if you are interested in mentoring the next generation of Wharton alumni, e-mail alumni.affairs@wharton.upenn.edu.

USA: WRAPUP 1-Credit quality in broad decline as defaults soar.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
(Wraps FINANCIAL-CREDITQUALITY-MOODYS and FINANCIAL-DEFAULTS-S&P) 
By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Corporate credit quality will likely grow much worse before it gets better, and about $100 billion of corporate debt will likely go into default this year as the United States heads into recession, according to reports issued on Monday by two top credit rating agencies. 
Moody's Investors Service said it put ratings on review for downgrade for 122 U.S. companies with $543 billion of debt in the third quarter, dwarfing the 22 companies with $66 billion of debt it put on review for upgrade. Reviews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit. 
""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. 
Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's said more than 200 companies will default on about $100 billion of debt this year, compared with 117 defaulting on a record $42.3 billion in 2000. 
It said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated ""BB-plus"" or lower by S&P and ""Ba1"" or lower by Moody's because of their credit risks - will reach 9.4 percent by year end. Moody's forecasts a 10 percent rate. 
""The U.S. economy is clearly in a recession,"" said S&P Chief Economist David Wyss in a statement. ""Although Standard & Poor's expects it to be relatively mild and end in early 2002, the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is high."" 
Both agencies said the Sept. 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a three-year slump in corporate credit quality. Moody's blamed 38 reviews for downgrade in September alone on the attacks. 
COSTS RISE, PROTECTION WEAKENS 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. 
These include the weakening economy, the inability of many marginal companies to raise cash at tolerable interest rates, share buybacks, debt-financed merger activity, and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance and travel. 
""Many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dry up and be pushed over the brink,"" said David Keisman, managing director at S&P Risk Solutions. 
Even well-known companies are suffering rating declines. 
On Monday alone, for example, S&P downgraded McDonald Corp. after the world's largest fast-food chain said it will buy back up to $5 billion of stock, at a time S&P said the company's ""growth prospects for the future are less optimistic."" 
Meanwhile, Moody's downgraded Enron Corp., and warned it may downgrade it again. The energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confidence, reflected in a share price that has plunged by more than half in two weeks, as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business. 
Puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues,"" he said. 
Still, through Friday, Moody's has said in the fourth quarter it may downgrade 47 companies, and upgrade just four.

USA: U.S. firms say deals with Enron at normal levels.
By Andrew Kelly

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Major U.S. wholesale natural gas and electricity traders said on Monday their deals with troubled Enron Corp. are still running at normal levels. 
But some are keeping a wary eye on the company's finances and credit status after a downgrade by one of the major rating agencies.
""We certainly are very well aware of what our exposure is to them and watching that on a daily basis,"" Chief Executive Marce Fuller of Atlanta energy marketer Mirant Corp. told Reuters. 
""At this point, I would categorize it as pretty much as business as usual with Enron, but we'll have to keep a close eye on it as we move forward,"" said Fuller. 
Officials at companies such as Houston natural gas firm El Paso Corp. and Columbus, Ohio, utility holding company American Electric Power Co. Inc. expressed similar sentiments, saying nothing had changed in their dealings with the Houston-based energy company, at least for the time being. 
""We continue to trade with them,"" said spokeswoman Jennifer Pierce of Charlotte-based utility Duke Energy Corp.. ""They've always been meticulous in their credit management and we continue to see that with them,"" she added. 
Enron's shares fell to yet another new low on Monday as the company said it was lobbying banks for a new credit line and rating agency Moody's Investor Service downgraded the company's senior unsecured debt to two notches above junk-bond status. 
Since Oct. 12 Enron's stock has fallen some 60 percent after the company reported its first quarterly loss in over four years, wrote down shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion dollars and failed to quell investors' jitters about a series of complex off-balance-sheet financial deals. 
CONFIDENCE CRUMBLES 
Analysts say that if confidence in Enron continued to crumble, it could restrict the company's access to credit and thus create problems for its core energy trading operations. 
European energy industry sources told Reuters earlier on Monday that there was already evidence of European companies shying away from trading with Enron because of credit worries. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron in Europe as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements, the sources said. 
""They are talking with us about bank letters of credit,"" said the head of risk management at one U.K. utility that halted its trade with Enron last week. ""The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis."" 
Traders in the U.S. wholesale energy markets said on Monday that they were continuing to deal with Enron and still regard the company as a reliable trading partner. 
""I don't have any problems dealing with Enron, especially since I'm doing day-ahead trades. But I have heard the rumors of people not wanting to deal with them,"" one natural gas trader in the U.S. Southeast told Reuters. 
A trader who specializes in longer-term deals in the forwards market for electricity said publicity about Enron's woes had not yet led to any loss of market liquidity. 
""Obviously there's a concern, but the financial situation is not a factor now,"" the trader said. 
Despite the public words of reassurance that many of them have been speaking, Enron's major competitors and trading partners continue to monitor the situation closely. 
""Any time a counterparty starts looking like their credit rating is deteriorating, then that would certainly be a signal to us to become more worried,"" said Mirant's Fuller.

Enron Bonds Stabilize But Market Players Are Concerned
By Michael C. Barr
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/29/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Uncertainty about Enron Corp. (ENE) continues to dog investors concerned about the future of the Houston-based energy services company. 
""It's such a fluid situation that the market would like to see a clarification of the company's circumstances,"" said Eric Bergson, portfolio manager, Northern Trust Global Investments, Chicago. Until this occurs, the outlook for the company's bonds is choppy, he added.
Enron drew down about $3 billion in credit lines last week to increase cash reserves and calm jittery markets, buying back its outstanding commercial paper. And, it's currently negotiating with its bank group for an additional $1 billion to $2 billion in new credit, according to a report in Monday's Wall Street Journal. 
Enron's troubles began earlier this month with the announcement of a $618 million third-quarter loss and the disclosure of a $1.2 billion erosion of investor equity related to transactions conducted with its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
""The company did not learn from the mistakes of others by not being ahead of the game on disclosure,"" said Mitch Stapley, portfolio manager and chief fixed income officer, Fifth Third Investment Advisors, Grand Rapids, Mich. It becomes harder to regain investors' trust, he said. 
Moody's Investors Service lowered the company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating Monday to Baa2 from Baa1. The debt is rated triple-B-plus by Standard & Poor's Corp., with a negative outlook. Fitch also maintains a triple-B-plus rating and it placed the debt on Rating Watch Negative late last week. 
Both Fitch and Moody's cited negative investor reaction to recent company developments. And Moody's added that its ""analysis of the developing situation will focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties."" 
One money manager said he was concerned ""about the fallout and its impact on the company's ability to trade"" energy. 
The company's bonds already have suffered as a result of the uncertainty. The bonds with a 6.40% coupon maturing in 2006 were offered at a dollar price of 80 on Friday. Many investors believe that the 80 dollar price point is a demarcation separating high-yield debt from distressed debt levels. 
The company's bonds improved a little on Monday, to about an 83 dollar price. 
""I'm seeing offerings but no bids,"" said Harold Rivkin, principal, H. Rivkin & Co., Princeton, N.J. There is a reluctance on the part of potential buyers because of the threat of future downgrades, he said. 
The cool reception that Enron's bonds are receiving is ""another example of an investment grade company not having sponsorship when it has problems,"" said Northern Trust's Bergson. 
The company did not respond to a telephone request for comment.

Enron's stock continues slide on credit woes

10/29/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp.'s stock slid to new lows on Monday, pushed down in part by Moody's Investors Service announcing a possible downgrade of the company's credit rating pending a review. 
The downgrade came as Enron negotiates with banks to establish new credit lines as the largest U.S. natural gas and power marketing company struggles to bounce back from disappointing third quarter earnings and a scandal over losses stemming from partnerships managed by the company's former chief financial officer.
In trading Monday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down nearly 9 percent, or dlrs 1.38 a share, at dlrs 14.02 - their lowest level in nearly seven years. A year ago, Enron stock sold at nearly dlrs 85 a share. 
Enron's efforts to acquire more credit came after the Houston-based company last week decided to cash in about dlrs 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence. 
""We are in discussions about new credit lines,"" Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Monday. ""We're taking action to restore investor and market confidence."" 
Denne would not disclose how much credit the company was seeking. But The Wall Street Journal quoted unidentified sources who said the amount is between dlrs 1 billion and dlrs 2 billion and that the deal is close to being completed. 
Denne said of the dlrs 3 billion in credit Enron cashed in last week, dlrs 2 billion of it was used to pay short term debt. Currently, there are no plans for the other dlrs 1 billion, she said. 
Moody's on Monday placed all of Enron's long term debt obligations on review for downgrade, citing ""substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses."" 
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of dlrs 638 million in the third quarter, taking a one-time charge of dlrs 1.01 billion attributed to investment losses, troubled assets and unit restructurings. 
Enron's stock was hammered over the next week as it became apparent some of those losses were tied to partnerships managed by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
Concerns about a potential conflict of interest touched off an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Enron ousted Fastow last week. 
Moody's said in a press release the ""magnitude of the announced charges will reduce Enron's equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat over 50 percent while slashing earnings.""

UK: UK power mkt focuses on prompt after low peak deal.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Interest in Britain's electricity markets focused on the prompt after the sale of peak power at an unexpected low price tugged other prompt contracts lower. 
Traders said the market was surprised by the sale of day ahead peak power for EFA blocks three and four, from 0700 to 1500, at 13.50 pounds per megawatt hour which they said was below coal-or gas-fired power stations' operating cost.
""It was an interesting day. It was hard to believe someone could sell at those prices - it's below marginal costs,"" said one trader. 
Day ahead baseload opened relatively firm at 19.50/20.50 pounds but slipped during the day to around 18 pounds and was traded at about 17.56 pounds after the low peak trades. 
Traders said the forward curve was quite with contracts ending slightly lower. 
Attention focused on troubled U.S. energy trader Enron with European companies shying away from dealing with the utility because of credit concerns. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements. 
Enron is one of the largest traders in the UK market but traders said it was too early see any impact on liquidity. 
""Friday and Monday tend to be quieter anyway - it's hard to tell if there's any effect from Enron,"" said one trader. 
Enron in London declined to comment on the situation.

USA: UPDATE 2-Enron says in talks with banks for new credit line.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
(Changes paragraph 1, adds background details and byline, updates stock price) 
By David Howard Sinkman
NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp., its shares in a new free-fall to near seven-year lows, said on Monday it is seeking additional credit to bolster investor confidence after tapping about $3 billion in credit last week. 
Enron, the nation's biggest energy trader, declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with or when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line. 
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston, referring to company efforts to secure new credit. 
Company shares again tumbled on Monday, shedding $1.57, or 10.13 percent, to $13.93 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Once a Wall Street darling, the stock has tumbled more than half in price since Enron released earnings two weeks ago, losing about $15.1 billion in market capitalization as investors fretted about the transparency of off-balance sheet transactions. 
Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status, and warned it may cut it again, as well as its rating for Enron's commercial paper. Rating agency Standard & Poor's on Thursday revised its outlook for Enron's ratings to ""negative"" from ""stable."" 
Enron's credit-worthiness has a direct affect on the price it pays to take out loans, and the perception among its trading partners on the company's ability to make good on trades. 
Moody's said Enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write-downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments. It said this triggered ""difficulties in rolling over commercial paper."" 
Industry sources on Monday said several large energy companies in Europe are shying away from trading with Enron amid concerns about the company's credit status. 
SIGN OF WEAKNESS 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the size of the credit line Enron is negotiating is between $1 billion to $2 billion. Enron said it drew down about $3 billion in credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
However, many industry observes see the request by Enron, which has about $63.4 billion in energy assets, for an additional credit as a sign of weakness. 
""Clearly, both the stock and bond market view Enron as being in dire straits,"" said independent research firm Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson, who specializes in high grade corporate bonds. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead it's an act of desperation.""

USA: TRADE IDEA-Junk rating not likely for Enron.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - A collapse of market 
confidence could hurt the credit quality of energy trading
giant Enron Corp., but its bonds are not likely to end 
up in junk territory, fixed-income research service GimmeCredit 
said on Monday. 
Moreover, Enron's bonds could be undervalued if the 
company's off-balance-sheet obligations amount to no more 
than $3 billion, as reported, GimmeCredit said. 
""Worst case, Enron doesn't look like a junk credit,"" 
GimmeCredit analyst Carol Levenson said. ""But perception is 
all, and clearly both the stock and bond markets view Enron 
as being in dire straits."" 
Enron's bonds fell sharply on Friday after the energy 
giant drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and 
said it was in talks with its banks to obtain a new 
multibillion-dollar credit line. 
The company's stock has lost more than half of its 
value in the last two weeks as investors questioned 
off-balance-sheet transactions between the company and two 
limited partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer 
Andrew Fastow. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
is looking into those transactions for possible conflicts 
of interest. 
""We admit management's financial disclosure remains 
woefully inadequate,"" GimmeCredit said. ""However, botched 
investor communication does not necessarily equate to 
illegal or fraudulent behavior."" 
Still, Enron's move last week to draw down all of its 
backup bank lines was ""an act of desperation,"" GimmeCredit 
said. The move eventually may lead to renegotiated bank 
agreements, which could be more expensive and restrictive 
and could also subordinate the position of bondholders, it 
said. 
""On the plus side is our belief that management will do 
everything in their power to preserve the company's 
investment-grade ratings,"" the firm said. 
Another positive is a precedent the rating agencies set 
with Kmart Corp. in the mid-1990s, when they tried to avoid 
being the cause of a company's financial downfall, GimmeCredit 
said. 
Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut Enron's senior 
unsecured rating to ""Baa2"" from ""Baa1"" and kept it on 
review for further downgrade. Moody's said its actions were 
prompted by deterioration in Enron's financial flexibility 
since the company announced significant write-downs and 
equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership 
investments. 
Last Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its outlook on 
Enron to negative while affirming its ""BBB-plus"" long-term 
rating.

USA: Enron shares drop to near seven-year lows.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. shares fell to their lowest level in almost seven years in early trade on Monday following news that North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader was considering tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron shares were down $1.55, or 10 percent, to $13.95 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have not been under $14 since December 1994.
Earlier, the credit-rating agency Moody's Investor Service placed all long term-debt obligations of Enron under review for downgrade following the company's announcement of significant write-downs and charges, reflecting substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses. 
Moody's said the actions affect Enron's broadband operations, its merchant portfolio, and the Azurix water company holdings. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

Enron long-term ratings all placed on review for downgrade - Moody's

10/29/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Moody's Investors Service said it placed all the long-term debt obligations of Enron on review for downgrade following the company's announcement of significant write-downs and charges, reflecting substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses. 
The magnitude of the announced charges will reduce Enron's equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat over 50 pct while slashing earnings, Moody's said in a statement.
The company's previously announced sale of Portland General, however, will result in cash proceeds approximating 1.8 bln usd which management is earmarking for debt reduction. In addition, the sale will remove approximately 1 bln usd of debt obligations from Enron's balance sheet. 
However, Moody's noted that, while this transaction will go a long way to help restore Enron's balance sheet, it requires regulatory approval and is likely to take up to a year to complete. 
Enron has a Baa1 senior unsecured rating.

Enron Shares Fall After Moody's Cuts Credit Rating (Update6)
2001-10-29 16:46 (New York)

Enron Shares Fall After Moody's Cuts Credit Rating (Update6)

     (Adds bondholder quote and background on commercial paper.)

     New York, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares declined
a ninth day as Moody's Investors Service lowered its credit
rating, raising concern the largest energy trader would be cut off
from raising the cash it needs to fund day-to-day operations.

     Moody's lowered Enron's senior unsecured long-term debt
ratings to ``Baa2,'' two levels above junk, from ``Baa1'' and also
placed the Houston-based company's ``P-2'' rating for commercial
paper on review for downgrade.

     Moody's may downgrade Enron's commercial paper rating, which
would make it harder for the firm to borrow the short-term cash
needed to run its trading businesses. Ahead of a potential cut,
Enron took out bank lines to repay $2 billion in commercial paper
last week, largely removing itself from that borrowing arena.

     ``They've pretty much already written off coming to the
commercial-paper market,'' said Shannon Bass, who holds Enron
bonds in the $50 million he helps manage at Pacific Investment
Management Co. ``The real issue now is trying to get their house
in order.''

     Pimco is ``well underweight'' Enron bonds relative to bond
benchmarks the portfolios are matched to, Bass said.

                             Shut Out

     Companies such as Xerox Corp., which was shut out of the
commercial-paper market a year ago before its credit ratings were
reduced, were forced to borrow on bank credit lines to access
cash. Investors in commercial paper, borrowings due in nine months
or less, also stopped buying Motorola Inc. and Lucent Technologies
Inc. short-term debt, forcing the firms to restructure borrowing,
sell assets, and find alternative financing sources that typically
cost more.

     Enron shares plunged $1.59, or 10 percent, to $13.81,
continuing a slide that dates back to Oct. 17, when Enron reported
$1.01 billion in losses from investments outside its business of
energy trading.

     The stock traded near $90 in September 2000 and touched a
seven-year low of $13.55 today. Enron has lost more than $50
billion in market value this year. On Dec. 31, the company had a
market capitalization of $62.7 billion. Today, the market value
was $10.5 billion.

                           Deterioration

     While Enron shares have sank about 60 percent in a week, its
bonds are down about 20 percent. A company's stock typically falls
faster than its debt because bondholders have first claim on
assets after bank loans are paid.

     The company's 6.4 percent bonds maturing in 2006 fell 4 cents
to 80 cents on the $1 of face value after the Moody's downgrade.
Yields have risen to 12.1 percent, up from 10.8 before that
downgrade, traders said. The bonds were trading at 100 cents the
week before.

     Moody's said the cut was prompted by the ``deterioration in
Enron's financial flexibility'' since the write-downs and charges.
The partnership investments had not been disclosed before this
month, which ``led to a substantial loss in investor confidence,''
according to Moody's.

     ``A credit downgrade will be punitive as far as their
borrowing power,'' said Joe Correnti, who follows Enron for Wayne
Hummer Investments LLC in Chicago. ``That's not a good place for
them to be. They have somewhat aggressive expansion plans.''

     Enron's recent woes had many investors factoring in a credit-
rating reduction. ``This move was anticipated,'' said Mike Dineen,
who holds Enron bonds in the $5 billion of fixed-income assets he
helps manage at Mony Life Insurance Co.

     There are about $15.8 billion of Enron bonds outstanding,
almost $9 billion of which comes due between 2003 and 2006,
according to Bloomberg data.

                            Cash Needed

     Last week, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for
information about transactions he conducted for partnerships he
headed. In August, Jeff Skilling quit as Enron chief executive,
eight months after taking the position, and Chairman Ken Lay moved
back into the position.

    Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company's stock
has plummeted 57 percent since Oct. 17, when Fastow's partnerships
were disclosed.

    Enron uses its investment-grade credit rating to borrow money
for the cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades and
to keep trading partners.

     ``When you act as a middleman you need high credit ratings.
It's likely their trading volumes will go down'' as other energy
and financial firms seek higher-rated trading partners, said Sean
Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co., which gives
Enron's credit a junk grade of ``BB+.''

     Enron's long-term ratings outlook was changed last week to
negative from stable by Standard & Poor's. S&P affirmed the firm's
rating of ``BBB+'', the equivalent of Moody's ``Baa1''.

     ``We have been split-rated before and it did not affect our
growth,'' said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron.
``We are still investment grade.''



Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update2)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.59, or 10 percent, to
$13.81. The stock has tumbled 82 percent in the past 12 months.



Enron May Be Royal Dutch/Shell Takeover Target, Newsletter Says
2001-10-29 13:31 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- The Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
the second-largest publicly traded oil company, may be interested
in buying Enron Corp., which has seen its stock price plunge in
the last two weeks, industry newsletter Power Finance & Risk
reported, citing unnamed sources.

     With Enron's market valued dropping below $11.5 billion from
a high of more than $55 billion, companies such as Royal
Dutch/Shell would be able to buy it with ``little trouble,'' the
newsletter reported.

     Royal Dutch/Shell, based in London and The Hague,
Netherlands, had approached Enron about a buyout in August, and
has sought to purchase the company for three years, the newsletter
said, citing an unnamed banker in London and an unnamed analyst in
New York.

     Shell spokesman Mary Brennan said the company wouldn't
comment on market speculation. Enron didn't immediately return
calls seeking comment on reports of possible buyout offer.



Enron Credit Cut by Moody's; CP Rating Put on Review (Update3)

Enron Credit Cut by Moody's; CP Rating Put on Review (Update3)

     (Adds yield data in fourth paragraph; adds Moody's comments
in sixth and seventh paragraphs.)

     New York, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
was cut by Moody's Investors Service after the largest energy
trader wrote down the value of its assets because of losses from
private partnerships.

     Moody's also said it may downgrade Enron's commercial paper
rating, which could make it harder for the company to borrow the
short-term cash it needs to run its trading business in the
future. The company borrowed from banks to repay $2 billion in
commercial paper last week.

     ``This move was anticipated,'' said Mike Dineen, who holds
Enron bonds in the $5 billion of fixed-income assets he helps
manage at Mony Life Insurance Co.

     Enron's 6.4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell as much as
4 cents to bid at 80 cents on $1 of face value after the Moody's
downgrade, traders said. The bonds tumbled from about par value a
week ago. Yields have risen to 12.1 percent, up from 10.8 before
that downgrade, traders said. Shares of Enron fell as much as
$1.85, or 12 percent, to $13.55.

     Moody's lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings
of Enron to ``Baa2,'' two levels above junk, from ``Baa1.'' The
ratings company said they may be lowered further. Moody's placed
the company's ``P-2'' rating for commercial paper on review for
downgrade.

     Moody's said the cut was prompted by the ``deterioration in
Enron's financial flexibility'' since the write-downs and charges.
The partnership investments had not been disclosed before.

     Enron's recent disclosures have ``led to a substantial loss
in investor confidence,'' Moody's said in its news release.

                            Cash Needed

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses this month from
investments outside its business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
quit as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for
information about transactions he conducted for partnerships he
headed.

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company's stock
has plummeted 57 percent since Oct. 17, when the partnerships were
disclosed.

     Enron uses its investment-grade credit rating to borrow money
for the  cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades and
to keep trading partners.

     ``Enron definitely depends on higher ratings,'' Dineen said.
     Enron's long-term credit ratings outlook was changed last
week to negative from stable by Standard & Poor's. S&P affirmed
the Houston-based company's rating of ``BBB+'', the equivalent of
Moody's ``Baa1''.

     ``We have been split-rated before and it did not affect our
growth,'' said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron.
`` We are still investment grade.''



Insiders at Electric Utilities Showing Their Faith

Name an industry where one of its best-known players went public in 1996, saw its stock rise more than 1,800% in the following five years, but now finds its shares half off their 2001 highs? Internet? Telecom equipment? 
Surprise! The stock is Calpine (CPN:NYSE - news - commentary) , and the industry is electric utilities. 
Three other stocks in the same group have given investors pretty wild rides as well, only to find themselves well off their 52-week highs: AES (AES:NYSE - news - commentary) , Mirant (MIR:NYSE - news - commentary) and NRG Energy (NRG:NYSE - news - commentary) . 
These four companies also have something else in common: Insiders at all of them are signaling that their stocks are oversold. When there is significant insider buying in so many related firms, we cannot help but think there is a positive industry trend to profit from. 
Utilities may not seem like a sexy sector, but these particular stocks have proved that they can move as well as any small-cap, high-tech play. Their volatility stems from the fact that the companies they represent are not regulated utilities paying fat dividends, but independent power producers (IPPs) that derive as much profit as they can from the margins over fuel costs. 
In some ways, IPPs are to regulated utilities what the old English navy was to the Spanish Armada. IPPs are less restricted in the scope and geography of their business movements. This has spurred a more entrepreneurial culture at IPPs that often allows them to outmaneuver regulated utilities when chasing after business opportunities. 
The insider buying at all four companies was obviously interesting. They all had several insiders recently purchasing within a short time period, and many of the buyers also had good track records trading their companies' shares. Several were also adding significantly to their holdings. 
At AES, for example, three of the eight executives that purchased shares in late September for $13 a share or less, were also smart sellers over the past few years when AES fetched between $40 to $60. And at Mirant, the five insiders that purchased in September increased their holdings by an average of 53%. 
This confluence of positive insider signals was more than enough to get me researching these companies and this industry further, and I like what I see. 
""There's been a lot of talk about if we have an oversupply of energy,"" remarks Calpine spokesperson Katherine Potter on one of the main reasons IPP stocks are weak now. ""But while supply may be fine right now, you also have to look at the quality of [that] supply. There is such a tremendous opportunity to replace infrastructure."" 
Out With the Old, In With the New
The fact is, there are a lot of antiquated power plants and overburdened backbones in the power industry, and IPPs stand to benefit tremendously from replacing the older infrastructure to service the growing demand for energy in the U.S. and abroad. 
With more scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of the present, aging facilities exacerbating price spikes, municipalities and industry would much rather choose reasonably priced energy from dependable sources if they are available. 
Although most IPPs use oil, gas, coal or a combination of these fuels to power present facilities, the vast majority of plants they're building now are a new generation of natural gas-powered turbines that are much more efficient than old gas-fired facilities. An IPP will typically build one of these new plants near cities or other areas with high and growing electricity needs, and compete with the older facilities in the region for the business. 
But it's not really fair competition. New plants can generate up to 40% more energy from the same amount of gas used by some older designs. The new natural gas turbines also have a smaller footprint and fewer emissions than their predecessors, and can therefore be located closer to where the power is needed. Can you say lower transmission costs? 
So with the cost of the natural gas representing a good two-thirds of a generator's cost, less fuel expenditure combined with a decrease in transmission infrastructure to pay for leaves more love left for an IPP's bottom line. 
As older gas-fired and nuclear plants are decommissioned, IPPs will continue to increase the amount of product (and profits) they produce. At the same time, the trend toward more efficient gas plants will help slow the increases in overall demand for natural gas, and keep the cost of this commodity from reaching stratospheric levels. 
Although, as previously mentioned, IPP stocks are well off their highs, analysts are as taken with the group as insiders are right now. Most analysts following the four IPPs I've recommended rate them a buy or strong buy. 
This is not too surprising considering that bottom-line growth for NRG, AES, and Calpine next year is forecast at 24% to 25%, while analysts expect Mirant to boost earnings per share by 30% in 2002. All of these shares are trading for 12 times or less the low end of next year's EPS expectations. 
Chartists will note that the technicals of the IPP stocks I've mentioned still look weak, and may choose to wait for a better entry point. But longer-term investors should feel comfortable joining the insiders now. 
Postscript
Readers will note that we have not included Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) in our group of recommended IPPs. Although we cannot boast of foreseeing its present travails (resulting from too-clever-by-half off-balance sheet investments), we had ignored it because Enron did not have a positive insider signal like its peers. 
Insiders were still selling Enron as late as Aug. 2 of this year when the stock was nearly half off its highs, and although there was one insider purchase in August, there was not a cluster of activity as in the other IPP stocks we've recommended. There was no buying after Sept. 11. 
If Enron's problems are unique to it, as the industry insiders we talked to believe, this is yet another case of insiders giving investors an excellent signal of relative attractiveness of stocks within an industry. 


A Debacle Like Enron's Can Undermine the Entire Market

Sometimes one stock can completely transfix the market in a negative way. 
Right now that one stock is Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) . It transfixes us because it acknowledges a simple truth: We are just dealing with pieces of paper here, pieces of paper backed up by nothing but the honesty and culture of the people who work at the company. 
When you put it that way, you realize how fragile this game can be. We have to believe that the system of checks and balances we have -- outside accountants, lawyers and the SEC -- can put enough pressure, honest pressure, on execs to keep them from doing the wrong thing. 
When they don't we have no clue of what we are buying. 
I keep thinking back to Cendant (CD:NYSE - news - commentary) , which collapsed three years ago when it turns out that one of the companies that made up Cendant was a bogus company: CU International. Who knew what the company was really worth if CU was a fraud? Who knew what the multiple might be? Who knew what the company was worth? Who knew how to value it? 
When you don't know, you don't average down. You sell. You ask questions later. 
That's what is going on with Enron right now, and it is freaking out everybody as Enron, while not a keystone of this market, was a core holding of outfits like Janus, Putnam, Citigroup, State Street and Fidelity. 
Anytime you get a stock that is widely held that loses billions in market capitalization overnight, whether it be Lucent (LU:NYSE - news - commentary) or Nortel (NT:NYSE - news - commentary) or Enron, you scare portfolio managers. When the selloff is exacerbated by fears of chicanery, it gets even worse. Enron's turning into the story that threatens to be a crossover, one that is doing more than just pulling down utilities. The market is about confidence. We have to have confidence that paper assets are backed up by something, even if it is the prestige and honor of executives. When that confidence is undermined in one major stock, it gets undermined in all. 
That's where we are right now.

Moody's downgrades Enron's debt
Enron asking banks for more credit 
Lisa Sanders
CBSMarketWatch.com
10/29/01
NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - Shares of Enron fell further Monday after Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron's long-term debt a notch.
Enron, which hit a 52-week high of $84.88 on Dec. 29, was well on its way to another year low Monday. Heading for a ninth straight day of losses, Enron shed more than 9 percent, or $1.41, to $13.99. The stock was again the most active mover on the New York Stock Exchange as close to 28 million shares had changed hands.
Moody's said it cut the senior unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, and the ratings remain on review for potential additional downgrades. The action follows Enron's reported $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter and was driven by the expectation of further write-downs and the swift deterioration of the company's financial picture, said Stephen Moore, vice president at Moody's. 
""However, we do feel the move Enron made to draw down their revolvers to pay off their commercial paper was a smart business move,"" said Stephen Moore, vice president at Moody's. The rating agency said it would review the Prime-2 rating on Enron's commercial paper.
Last Thursday, Enron announced it had tapped its lines of credit to provide more than $1 billion in cash liquidity and that would it use $2 billion to pay down commercial paper.
The decision to pay off the commercial paper, he said, accomplishes two goals.
""It increases liquidity on a short-term basis, and additionally, it enables them to focus on other areas they need to focus on right now,"" Moore said. ""They are working on setting up an additional facility for further capital to support their wholesale trading business."" 
Karen Denne, an Enron spokesperson, confirmed Monday that the company is in discussions with banks for further financing. Additional credit would help boost Enron's liquidity position.
The lingering concern for Moody's is that there ""yet may be something else out there that gets to the credibility issue of Enron itself,"" Moore said. 
At the heart of the credibility issue are two limited partnerships -- LMJ and LMJ2 - created in 1999 by former CFO Andy Fastow and since dissolved. Enron ousted Fastow last week. See related story. </news/story.asp?guid=%7BFCA73BA9%2D55D0%2D4EE8%2DB6E7%2DBD924898CA4B%7D&siteid=mktw> ""The market was unaware,"" of the existence of the partnerships, Moore said.
""Quite frankly, we don't think there is anything else,"" he said. ""But Enron is huge, and if this could happen...there is a lingering concern that something else might happen. We cannot confirm or deny that this is true. We will be meeting soon with them to resolve issues such as these.""
Moore said the meeting could come as soon as this week.
""Should the wholesale trading business and the counterparties therein become impacted by these events, that could lead to the slowing growth of the wholesale business, the Enron engine,"" he said. 
Moody's action Monday also negatively affected the ratings on two trusts -- Marlin Water Trust and Osprey, which have combined debt of $3.2 billion. Marlin is now rated Baa2, while Osprey carries a new rating of Baa3, both down a notch.
The potential issue for the trusts may be ""how much equity Enron would have to issue if the sale of the underlying assets alone isn't enough to pay off the debt."" Enron is anticipating using the proceeds from the sale of assets to meet its obligation.

Enron Goes Begging 
Forbes.com staff, Forbes.com </news>, 10.29.01, 11:40 AM ET 

NEW YORK - Enron said this morning that it is in talks with banks for additional credit, as declining investor confidence sent its stock to a six-year low and several large energy groups put their dealings with Enron on hold. Last Thursday, the energy trader drew down about $3 billion from a credit line, causing its bonds to fall sharply on Friday. 

Enron (nyse: ENE ) has been scrambling to reassure investors and business partners since Oct. 16--after the company reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years. The $638 million loss included $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments. A week later, it disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives. Fastow was forced to step down from the company last week. 

The turmoil makes it clearer than ever that Enron's problems weren't solved by the recent departure of Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling.


In these challenging times, Enron deserves our thanks 
Houston Chronicle, October 28, 2001
By BILL WHITE 
Enron and its employees have blessed Houston, and many Houstonians should now take the time to say ""thanks"" when the company has experienced some highly publicized challenges. Enron attracted thousands of great people to Houston and changed Houston's economy forever. The company's management encouraged their employees to be active citizens, and those folks responded by making a big difference in their community. 
Enron's lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a multibillion-dollar new industry, with Houston as its hub. Even while it competed hard to win in the marketplace, Enron's example helped show other natural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger market of electricity. The downtown concentration of these firms -- industry leaders including Reliant, Dynegy, El Paso and Duke Energy -- led London's Financial Times to refer to Louisiana Street as the Wall Street of electricity. 
This explosive growth attracted bright young people -- with the average age of Enron employees at under 35 -- and they in turn helped fuel an explosion in residential growth in Houston's downtown. This, in turn, helped revitalize downtown's retail and restaurant scene. Enron's construction of a large Class A office tower, still going up, is a milestone in Houston's growth, an official end to more than a decade of large amounts of vacant office space. 
Virtually every civic or charitable activity in Houston learned to count on Enron for both financial support and thousands of hours of invaluable volunteer activities. If Enron or its chairman, Ken Lay, led a visionary effort, such as hosting the meeting of G7 trade ministers, or more recently the private funding of the Houston Biotechnology Center, Houstonians knew it would be done right. Without Lay our town would have lost major league baseball and status as a big league town. 
Employees know Enron set a standard for hiring and promoting employees based on their potential, with no glass ceilings. Women have run large divisions and subsidiaries. Many military officers find that Enron called on their talents after illustrious military careers, even at ages well past normal corporate entry level. The most highly recruited young people flock to a company that invests heavily in their training and then lets them rise as far and fast as their talent and ability to work hard would allow them. 
Enron's corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees who have lived the American dream. With the habits of work learned on a family farm in Missouri, Ken Lay got an education ending with a graduate degree at the University of Houston, served his country in government and began a career in the gas pipeline business. When Northern Natural Gas acquired the smaller Houston Natural Gas, Northern's chairman surprised folks by installing Lay as his successor. I was at Northern's headquarters in Omaha the week after the merger 16 years ago when Northern's chairman reassured folks that they could count on ""best young executive in the business, Ken Lay,"" to direct their future in a changing marketplace. Within 15 years, most of Enron's revenues and profits came from businesses that did not even exist when Lay had taken over, all of which had been created from within the firm. This success did not diminish the farm boy decency and sense of fairness that attracted top talent to his team. 
Enron rewarded innovation, while many firms afraid to alter the old formula wondered why their leadership eroded. Year after year, top executives throughout the country voted Enron our nation's most innovative corporation. Enron recognized, even when financial markets do not, that innovative firms are secure enough to accept occasional failure and the inevitable price of other successes. 
Rather than seeking insulation from the international marketplace, as had many American businesses, Enron welcomed the challenge of the international market, confident that American firms could compete and win. Enron also welcomed the challenge of responsible environmental stewardship, and called on industry to address the issue of global warming even as some companies feared the impact of pollution control on their bottom line. 
Enron's phenomenal success created incredible and perhaps unreasonable expectations, as early this year when the stock market valued the company based on 20 percent annual growth, forever. Enron's size and success made it a convenient target for politicians in California and India, even as Enron supplied the electricity they so needed. Sometimes it seemed the company's upstart origins as the David battling utility Goliaths delayed the firm's perception that it had won and no longer played the role of an underdog. 
And so if Enron experiences problems, it will learn from them, just as strong people do. Let's not prejudge Enron's current challenges. The more than a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies who hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but never to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story. 
Throughout its years of success, Enron folks have never forgotten to find so many ways to make the firm's hometown of Houston a better place to live and work. As Enron enters a new phase of its life, let's not forget to express thanks and steady support. 

White is a Houston business executive and civic leader and former government official, with no relationship to Enron.

"FW: Claims trading update and pipeline","I asked Brad for a brief summary of the current status of our claims trading activities, focussing on the efforts to settle claims already purchased and with a view towards collecting cash by year end. In addition, there is a brief summary of the pipeline for 2002 that is shaping up. If all the stars align we should have a significant portion of our working capital back in by yearend and a number of transactions primed for the first quarter of 2002.

We have one small live transaction that has been caught up in Enron's financial mess. It is a deal agreed to with Pacificorp to buy a claim for $225,000 which has an expected sales value of $275-300,000. We had prepared a dash for approval to buy the claim, but changed tact to avoid processing approvals for any new claims business for the time being. Instead, we are using the option built into our JV agreement which allows our partner GRS to fund claims purchases separately if we decline a transaction. So, rather than have Enron fund the purchase and take the risk, GRS will find an alternative arrangement and share the revenue with us through the JV agreement. Not an ideal situation, especially since this mechanism was intended to handle one off large transactions they liked but we were uncomfortable with. Nevertheless, it keeps us in the business and hopefully sets up a better value for the eventual inclusion of the activity together with other parts of IRM's business for Energy Re.

Please note the larger deals in the pipeline with Equitas, KMS and Home. I want to point out that while calling this a trading business may be a stretch on our part, especially if defined in the classic sense of trading a commodity, i.e. the ability to go short first. The willingness of Equitas and others to give us a sale price to work from is essentially a free put option that creates a synthetic short for us. Overtime, their cooperation should allow us to run a book of business from both perspectives, i.e. going long first when the price is right or going short first by having the sales price agreed in advance with the Schemes.

Subject:	Claims trading update and pipeline

Below is an update of where we are on collecting for the four claims purchased to date, and the pipeline for the rest of this year and first part of next.

Status

Janet Wood is finalizing some adjustments to the release documents for the three schemes, so that we can use the power of attorney granted to us in the assignments to sign the release on behalf of the insureds.  The documents will go to the schemes this week.

KMS has agreed to pay us $52k for their share of the four purchsed claims (Phillips, Montrose, Kaiser and Mitchell), which is just slightly (<1%) less than what we asked for.  They are ready to sign for Phillips now, once the document tweaking above is finished, and are awaiting a few more bits of paper on the other three, so we will sign Phillips as soon as the release language is agreed, and the others hopefully this week or next, so we should have the funds in by year-end.

PRO has agreed Phillips and is willing to let us sign the release document prevsiously sent to Phillips, but as noted above we need to modify the document somewhat and put GRS's name on it.  I don't know for sure how long they will take to turn docs, but next this week or next is possible, w/ funds again by the end of the year.  They have almost all the documentation for the other three, and seem to be able to turn things around quickly, so we should have the other claims accepted and documents agreed w/in two weeks.  They have said they can pay on short notice, so we should have current payouts on all four claims (total of $1.1MM) in by year-end.

As noted earlier, PRO has reversed their previous assertion that they are willing to do one-time settlements/commutations.  We are working to get this changed and understand why they have done it, since it is obviously bad news.  The existing deals look fine, even w/ this development, except Phillips, which ends up w/ a gross margin of about 10%, which is obviously unsatisfactory.  These figures are w/o the benefit of Omni's pricing, however, which has been promised for Wednesday.  There are various ways to manage around this development, but the first choice is to get the policy changed.

The administrator for OIC and E&A, two of the three companies managed by Omni, has promised pricing for Wednesday, which will go a long way towards nailing down valuations.  They have a slower processing time than the other schemes -- three to five months officially, but generally one to two in practice -- but are potentially willing to negotiate price and pay before their process is done, w/ a part of the proceeds held in escrow in case their calculation of gross settlement amount differs from ours.  We will also hear this week their proposal for how this would work, but they have said we should be able to get funds by year-end.

The administrator for Andrew Weir, the other company managed by Omni, is working on pricing also, and promised it for this week or next.  He is subject to the same time constraint as OIC/E&A noted above, but is willing to give us all or most of the current payout before Omni finishes its work, so we should have that $700k in by year-end as well.

Assuming all of the above works as planned, we should have all funds recovered by year end except the tails of PRO ($700k) and Andrew Weir ($200k), and whatever haircut or escrow amount OIC/E&A want to hold back pending final calculation of Gross Settlement Amount.

Pipeline

This is a snapshot of the pipeline/opportunities.  Unless otherwise noted, assume gross margins of 30%.  The last four items illustrate that the markets we are selling to are increasingly willing to give us a number up front on claims that they have been unable to settle, which removes much of the uncertainty regarding valuation, and makes our origination efforts more focused.

Pacificorp -- $225k price agreed
Hercules -- close to agreement on $1.2MM price
Dupont -- negotiating price of approximately $1.5MM
Owens Illinois -- negotiating price of approximately $3.75MM
Burlington / Santa Fe -- negotiating price of approximately $1.4MM
Home Insurance is working up numbers on all or part of a portfolio that we can purchase from their insureds for $75MM
Equitas has identified 6 claims for which they will pay us $12MM for the solvent piece alone -- upside would be the difference between that figure and what we can buy them for, plus everything that can be recovered from the schemes
KMS has given us numbers up front that they will pay for their piece of Foster Wheeler and PPG -- negotiating now w/ insureds
Equitas has given us a number of $100MM for Kaiser Aluminum, and KMS has given us a number of $20MM -- negotiating w/ Kaiser to try and obtain purchase price of $120MM, so all value sold to other schemes in excess of $5MM would be upside

"FW: George Update - FX","Jeff,

We have been working to try and get the crude products available in yen, but have not had much luck after Darren left.  You can see the general summary of the situation below.  We'd like to get the product up and believe that with some basic publicity it could be quite successful.  Any ideas on how to overcome these points?

Joe

After spending some time with Houston and London people over the past 2 weeks, the conclusion is that George cannot be up and running within the next 2-3 months. Obtaining live FX quotes is the major issue. Options that we considered were:

(a) Connect up to a bank's FX online system

Shane Dallman (UK) identified potential issues with this, the main one being technical issues associated with the EOL application. After consulting with EOL people, it appears the FX manager application is not suitable for linking to an external party at the moment. They are working on these issues as part of a larger development project but I cannot get a clear timetable out of them

(b) Get Thomas Cheng to run the FX manager

Issues include: 
* Thomas doesn't feel comfortable having to watch the FX market on a real time basis and update prices accordingly, given most of his time is spent on metals
* In that case, FX group would like automatic updates of the FX price from the market so he would not have to watch it all the time (we then get back to IT issues which Shane is checking out)

(c) Get a FX trader in Japan

The FX group is currently considering their staffing requirements but Pushkar Shahi (Director, FX Houston) said that there are no immediate plans to get someone out here.

I will keep monitoring the FX situation. Perhaps if you have time next week, you could speak to Gary Hickerson to get his thoughts.

Rousseau

   I've got 2 samples of fabric.  1 plain off white and the other a ribbed
   off
   white.  Elizabeth and I prefer the ribbed.
   Plain = $40 retail / $20 cost
   Ribbed = $50 retail  / $25 cost x 34 yards = $850
   I'll give them to you at cost so that we can continue furnishing your
   house
   ( I hear it's empty).
   If you have time this afternoon and can walk down to your Lobby I can
   meet
   you there to show you the fabrics.  Also, bring down a check so that I
   can
   stop by Walter Lee Culp and order you couches and fabric ma?ana.  Fabric
   can
   be overnighted if needed or sent 2 day.
   I think 2 day is plenty of time.

   50% now - (not including taxes)
   50% later + shipping and taxes when couches are ready for delivery (6-8
   wks.).

   Need now
   $5445 for 2 loveseats and 1 couch + $850 for fabric = $6295
   I will give you a receipt.
   Let me know when you can see the fabric........

      I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find the one
   you
      need
      at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the furniture
      stores
      only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8 weeks if
      they
      are in stock and usually are.  I'll get some fabric this Friday
   during
      lunch
      and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll need to
   order
      the
      fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets it.
   Also,
      I'll
      find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash) and then
      the
      other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit card.
   Checks
      payable to me and I pay with my company check.
      I'll get moving and call you on Friday.

Monthly Newsletter

Let's describe a typical and recurring nightmare for generating unit
operators. It's noon on August 15, temperatures have reached the upper 90s
all week; you're well into your reserve margin to serve native load, when a
unit trips off line. Do you scramble to find replacement power at record
high prices and worry about the consequences later? Or, have you prepared
for this event?

When the degree of risk has not been quantified, fear of the unknown can
lead to restless nights, and understandably so. The financial implications
can be astounding when a unit outage occurs during a period of high spikes
in market prices.

How does this relate to the recruitment and hiring of talent within your
shop? Allow me to bring the story together. What would you do if your top
employee came to you and said, ""You've been great to me and I've learned
alot, but I just accepted a job at your level right down the road and they
like me so much they want me to start tomorrow."" Do you spring into 911 mode
or are you ready for this day.

Start a relationship today with The Austin Group Energy. We will keep you
aware of all available talent in your market area. These candidates are

successful hires when they could hire them on their own. The smart and

I talked to them this morning and reminded them that any value in the business will disappear unless they continue to grow volumes.  They hit it out of the park.

If you get the chance to stop by tomorrow and let them know you are paying attention I think that would do a lot for morale.  Keeping up activity in this atmosphere is remarkable, and they deserve some recognition.  The only upside for them at this point is being sold and getting Enron back part or all of its investment.

In our lunch with Hess the other day, they mentioned a few things of interest regarding EOL.

They would like to be able to see what has traded (like on ICE).
They'd like to be able to put in orders even if our prices are not up.
Keen on the idea of trading settlement and particularly average.
Would like at the end of the month to square up NXC2s.
They still love EOL, they don't even have to write deal tickets for it, it goes straight into their system. Would dearly love 50 lots on gasoil.
Asked if we could go round and optimise EOL for them

Apart from that, didn't express much of a view, seemed to be playing it small on flat price.

"EGM Q3 fact sheet","
All, 

Attached, for your information,  is a 2 page financial and statistical fact sheet for EGM (as a consolidated unit and for each business unit).  I obviously would have liked our gross margin and EBIT to be a lot larger but all the other facts show enormous growth and progress.   I wanted to at least get it into your hands in case you needed a quick reference.

Thanks,
Mike

Just got off the phone with Greg Curran.  Guess he's been talking to you about the fact that I'm moving off the bandwidth trading desk here in London and have been exploring opportunities in different groups.  

Was telling Michelle Nezi Marvin last week about my situation.  Coincidentally, she offered to introduce me to you for some good advice as to what I should do.  I was one year behind her at Wharton and look forward to seeing her in Philadelphia next week for on-campus interviews.

I'm actually enjoying London quite a lot, and so am hoping to stay here for the time being.  But Greg suggested I send you a copy of my CV as you might be have some good ideas for me.

Thanks.... and look forward to speaking with you,

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

"possible participation in SPR move","If they limit the fill to oil from the royalty-in-kind program, we can't participate because that's only an option for companies drilling in the Gulf.
 
If they go beyond that (DOE sources say they are inclined to), there might be a chance for us to participate if they solicit offers on the spot market.  One consultant said that option is less likely, but they will look into it more closely for us.  More likely they would contract with some oil-producing states off market to provide the rest.
 
If they open it up to everyone, we will have plenty of time to make an offer during the solicitation period.

Subject:	EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

you take me
		to dinner--at least drinks.  By the way, I don't know if you
know that
		I'm currently offerring a car to anyone who finds me a wife.
Keep it in
		mind.

		Anyway,  I paid $10,900 plus tax, total $11799.25.  For you
$6,000.
		There are no more available, only 1912 were made in total.
(divided
		between white, yellow and rose gold.)  1912 was when the
model came out,
		and this was a reissue.  I have all papers, and box.

		Find me a girlfriend, please.

		Jeff

"natural gas","As I mentioned in our meeting the other day EGLI buys approximately 9,000 MMbtus per day of natural gas for the Morgan's Pt. MTBE plant. Since the price risk of this natural gas is for the account of EGLI I would appreciate your help as to when is a good buying opportunity for physical or financial natural gas. During July through September we bought on a floating price since the market was going down during each of those months. For October we bought fixed at $1.94/MMbtu. We purchase the physical gas from AEP delivered through the old HPL system.

"SOX Financing Update","The SO2 Emissions Credits Inventory transaction with Barclays Bank PLC has been extended for 12 more months as of yesterday, November 6. Barclays has arranged a facility of $170 million, of which $158 million was used as of yesterday. As a condition of extending the term past yesterday, Barclays required collateral in the form of a cash deposit or an L/C from an acceptable bank. We have posted cash until L/C lines become available. The cash raised, net of collateral posted, was approx $98 million, with capacity to put more SO2 credits into the facility. The facility allows Enron to raise cash off-balance sheet without leaving us with short positions in our SO2 book.

As a condition of Barclays accepting cash collateral instead of an L/C, we amended the Swap Master between ENA and Barclays PLC to reduce the number of days to pay to avoid a payment default to one business day from three business days after notification by Barclays. This amendment automatically reverts back to the original three business days immediately upon Enron posting an L/C to replace the cash collateral. Further, Barclays has agreed to review the need for collateral in six months, such that if our credit situation improves sufficiently Barclays will release the collateral while leaving the facility in place.

The terms of the transaction allow EGM to sell SO2 Credits into the facility and call back the credits on one day's notice multiple times over the next year. We pay interest expense in advance as a call option premium; if we call any credits back early, however, we receive a refund on the unused interest expense. The upfront fee was 50bp on $170 mm for the year (though we really have 13 months) and the spread is 65 bp.

Please contact Soma Ghosh or me if you would like further updates.

Morgan Stanley to trade in power
 
October 25, 2001 The Japan Times Jiji Press
 
U. S. investment bank Morgan Stanley will start electricity trading in Japan as early as this year, informed sources said Wednesday.
 
It will purchase electricity from power suppliers for sale to users, utility firms and financial institutions, in a role known as a power marketer in Europe and the United States.
 
Trading will be made through forward contracts, under which companies involved buy or sell electricity to be produced in the future. 
 
Since the method guarantees power generators' future sales, it makes it easier for them to map out investment plans. As a result, the number of companies starting power generation and construction of power plants is expected to increase, industry sources said.
 
Morgan Stanley decided to enter the domestic electricity business on expectations that it will become profitable if prices are determined by market mechanisms.

"RE: Project OZ update","Here's an update:

- We received detailed comments back from them on Monday, as reqd.
- We discussed these w/them, our legal and Morgan on Tues to clarify some items.
- Called them today to officially kill based mainly on the fact that in their response they had pulled the gathering system out of the collateral pool and proposed putting the gathered crude to the refinery at market rather than cost. This is a reduction of $5MM/yr in earnings and $10-15MM in collateral.
- After quite a bit of discussion today, it's clear they still want to get the deal done and are willing to revert back to having the gathered crude in at cost and as part of the collateral. The major issue is trying to find a structure in which they have some upside in the transaction beyond just the locked 1.4 coverage.

So...I said that if we get something in writing that puts gathering back in and satisfies our other reqmts, we will then try to revise the structure to give them a little more upside. Norman is traveling tomorrow and will get us something on Monday.

Subject:	Project OZ update

Below is a summary of my discussion w/ Norman Abood (General Counsel for GAF) in response to our termination letter dated 10/16/01 and his written response on 10/17.  Basically, I told Norman it was time to stop the paper trail and either get down to closing or go our separate ways.  I emphasized our primary concerns as follows:
  
	1.  GAF's ability to fund its equity
	2.  finalizing the feedstock supply and products off-take
	3.  Morgan's commitment to finance the debt 
	4.  defining the pool of assets to be collateralized
	5.  evidence of insurability, and 
	6.  restructuring of GAF's PSA w/ Farmland.

I also emphasized our frustration over the ""continually moving targets"" (debt, collateral, equity, feedstocks, etc...) and told him I will NOT continue to expend resources and time playing games.  Finally, I told him I was willing to re-engage on the following terms:

	a.  GAF submit either a written set of comments to our 9/21 MOU or a counter-proposal to us by Monday, 10/22.
	b.  If, subject to OUR review and based on US believing there's merit to proceed that we get ALL PARTIES (GAF, 	     Morgan Stanley and EGM) together and hammer out a definitive and final version of the MOU including, but not 		     limited to the primary concerns above (w/ all parties having ""subject to senior management and/or Board approval"" 	     language/conditions).  The purpose here is to get all the T&C down in writing with everyone in the room in 	     conceptual agreement which will make it more difficult for the targets to move.
	c.  Morgan Stanley must be willing to sign some form of commitment letter evidencing their willingness to finance the 	     transaction.

GAF will then have some finite/specific period of time in which to approach Farmland and restructure their deal as necessary to close the transaction.

Norman agreed in principle and committed to get back to us by tomorrow.  Hopefully, this will once and for all define whether or not this deal can get done.

"Another Petrobas Update","A Petrobas press official said there will be gasoline shortages if the strike extends past Sunday.  However, the company has enough gasoline to supply distributors through the weekend.  FUP has stated the strike will not result in a lack of gasoline, diesel and LPG b/c Petrobas and other distributors have on avg. 15-day stocks. 

The strike has currently reduced oil production by 56% (from 1.390 MMB/D to 550 MMB/D), reduced gas production by 32% (from 38 MM cu m/d to 25 MM cu m/d, and reduced refinery output by 5% (from 1.7 MMB/D to 1.616 MMB/D).  This was reported by Petrobas today.

Subject:	RE: petrobras update

	our agent just called in to say that the view in the unions is they will vote this weekend to extend the strike past sunday, as the only way to twist petrobras' arm.
he says they will not be able to shut down the refs but will lower the wick to the absolute minimum allowed by law, which means about a 40pct reduction in distillate production.

Subject:	petrobras update

just talked to marcello castilho, the head of petrobras office in london.  he gave me the following:
their crude production is down by 900mbd.  they have crude and product stocks for the next 5 days, but then will need to buy. initially the thought wud b to buy crude however, the situation may have worsened at the refineries.
he was pessimistic about the discussions. said that petrobras called them to a meeting ydy as everyone knows and only upped the ante by 1pct on their side vs the 8.5 sought plus the inflation catch-up of 42pct. this really angered the unions and they have now said they will not come back to the table before seeing the numbers next time.  he said petrobras is up against internal competition now from other oil and gas companies who are offering ex petrobras workers a 15pct increase over their current pay, so petrobras is in a poor position.

so far the refs have been running at very low rates and the managers have not allowed the workers to leave the prmeises but have bunked them and fed them their in 12 hour shifts. by law they can only do this for 3 days and some fighting has already broken out at one location, so doubtful they can continue the 'imprisonment' much longer.

if it comes to a bigger showdown he thinks the unions will just shut the refs down on the last shift that they work, and he will be buying product not crude.

"RE: Enron does its first yen based crude trade","For EJ, $500 minus the champagne for the two guys who did it.  Don't know what Slovenski booked against his curve.  Right now just trying to push through some basic mid mkt deals this (with hopes and expectations of closing Sato as well).  More structured transactions to follow (with real MTM value for EJ).  On 24/7 will come back to you.  Initially we were shut down on concept of George in Yen.  Will resurect this.  Also are going to want to push basic JCC.  We have developed (with some basic help from Research) projected forward curves for JCC.  We have also developed internally a system to ""help"" the traders delta hedge the position.  Would see dynamically managing this through adjusting hedge ratios up to month of delivery.  I'd like to spend some time going through this with you next week.

Mike/Jeff,
 
As indicated in the list of deals and interested cps that we sent you yesterday, we closed a transaction with Japanese trading company, Kobayashi Yoko, this afternoon.  Kinoshita and Anai had been working this company and had already gotten basic documentation and credit approval in place.  We had also gotten prior approval from Sheila Glover and Gary Hickerson to use the local metal's trader to handle FX swaps up to USD30MM.  Commodity and FX risk (except for 4 days from contract settlement) have been hedged with Singapore and ENA.  Not a big deal in and of itself (notional USD250k), but a start.  We believe there is much more demand and plan to see more in the near future.  Also expect to see first LPG deal with Marubeni with our new mid mkt ""trader"" very shortly.  We would back to back transaction as well.  Details of this transaction are as follows:
 
Enron Japan sells Dubai swap to Enron Singapore

Month: March 2002

Volume: 12,500bbls

Price: 20.24$/bbl

Enron Japan sells US$253,000 to ENA

Value date: 5 April 2002

Price: 118.92Y/$

Enron Japan buys Dubai swap from Kobayashi Yoko

Month: March 2002

Volume: 12,500bbls (=1,987.34 kl)

Price: 15,110Y/kl

"Oil Update from Washington","Here is a summary of what our key contacts are saying on the oil market:
 
SPR:  We still expect the Administration to announce an SPR fill plan very soon.  The original date has been postponed because work has been seriously disrupted up here due to anthrax scares.  We expect them to start with royalty oil, which means that companies drilling in Federal lands in the USG can pay some of their taxes in oil instead of money (like they did in 1999).  But DOE sources believe that this (approx 100kb/d) will not be enough for proponents of the plan, and they will want to expand the SPR fill to include purchases either through the spot market or through off-market contracts with key oil producing states.
 
IRAQ:  Sources believe that the US will try again for ""targeted sanctions"" when the oil for food program comes up for renewal in early December.  Like last time, there will be Iraqi disruptions, and also like last time, the US will likely give up after making a symbolic stand.  Bottom line -- we expect around 4-6 weeks of Iraqi oil export disruptions.
 
OPEC:  Our best info (at $22 WTI) is that OPEC will announce a cut of up to 1mb/d at the Nov 14 meeting, but we estimate that the cut will not take effect until Jan 1.  This will allow more time to see how the war develops, and allow time for the Iraq rollover situation to clarify.  There is still a chance that if compliance looks better in early Nov, the US fills the SPR aggressively and prices move up, OPEC may not cut at the meeting.
 
PRICES:  Things look a bit firmer for 2H Nov and Dec, assuming no new terrorist attacks that kill demand.  Demand should rise seasonally during this period, and pricing in Iraqi disruptions may also provide upward movement.  There could be room to climb toward the $24 WTI level between now and the end of the year.

  Hi Jeff,

Let me know when you are coming to London, so that I can be sure to be here
to show you the Knox cup and the new book by Steve Martin.

Since September 11, business has really dried up, mostly because my main
outlet is to Americans who are not travelling much at the moment.  So I
propose to send you a cheque for ?2800 within the next few days, or give it
to you when you come here, followed by a cheque for ?2500 in December and
one for ?2500 in January.   Total ?7800.   The last thing I was expecting
was you calling in your credit, and like all dealers I'm always trying to
keep my balance on the tightrope.   Let me know what you think.

In the meantime I have heard about the troubles at Enron, and I hope all
goes well for you.

Enron Discusses Credit Line of $1 Billion to $2 Billion With Banks

Enron Corp., scrambling to restore confidence in its finances, is negotiating with banks for a new credit line of between $1 billion and $2 billion, and is likely to close a deal within days, according to officials familiar with the matter. 
The new credit line is intended to bolster Enron's financial condition and head off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence. The new credit would supplement existing lines, which are largely tapped out after Enron last week drew down about $3 billion to increase cash reserves and calm fears in the stock, bond and energy markets.
An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line, but said he couldn't supply any further details. 
Houston-based Enron is the nation's biggest energy trader and a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Once a favorite of Wall Street, the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convincing a deeply concerned investment community that, despite difficulties, its finances remain sound. 
Confidence in Enron's financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier this month announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 billion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then-chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
Last week, Enron replaced Mr. Fastow and said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions. The company has consistently said that the transactions were proper and legal. 
Enron's stock price fell again Friday. As of 4 p.m., in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down 95 cents at $15.40. Enron shares have fallen 50% in the past two weeks and are down 83% from a Sept. 18, 2000, high of $89.63. 
Late last week, Enron tapped its existing credit lines, with part of that money being used to redeem nearly $2 billion of its outstanding commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs. Ron Barone of credit-rating agency Standard & Poor's said he believes that Enron was ""getting a bit more resistance"" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due. Thus, Enron probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstanding, he said. 
The Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and still leaving the company with an additional roughly $1 billion cash on hand would give it more financial flexibility. 
Also last week, credit-rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing Enron's debt and commercial-paper ratings for a possible downgrade. A lower rating could hamper Enron's core trading businesses. 
Behind the worries among these agencies, in part, is the loss of investor confidence, which one of the rating companies, Fitch, said in a report last week could impair ""Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital markets, therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business."" 
The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company's trading partners are doing business with Enron on ""essentially the same terms"" as they have in the past. ""There has been no significant change in the credit conditions,"" he said. Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant's finances. 
The banks involved in the current negotiations, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the new credit line than they had asked for in the past, one official said. 
Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments. ""Confidence in this company was lost,"" said one bank official involved in the negotiations for a new credit line. ""But confidence will be restored."" 
Corporations of Enron's size commonly establish credit lines only to demonstrate to the investment community that in case of an emergency, they have access to cash. In practice, few companies actually make use of these lines. Thus, drawing down credit lines, while providing immediate cash, also illustrates the pressure Enron is feeling.

Manager's Journal: How Enron Ran Out of Gas
By Paul Kedrosky

The Wall Street Journal
A22
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Is troubled Enron Corp. the Long Term Capital Management of the energy markets, or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too many of their own press releases? Or is poor Enron just misunderstood? Those are the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial releases from the beleaguered Houston-based energy concern. 
A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot. While tech stocks were tanking, Enron's shares gained 89% during 2000. Even die-hard Enron skeptics -- of which there are many -- had to concede that last year was a barnburner for the company. Earnings were up 25%, and revenues more than doubled.
Not bad, considering where the company came from. A decade ago 80% of Enron's revenues came from the staid (and regulated) gas-pipeline business. No longer. Enron has been selling those assets steadily, partly fuelling revenues, but also expanding into new areas. By 2000, around 95% of its revenues and more than 80% of its profits came from trading energy, and buying and selling stakes in energy producers. 
The stock market applauded the move: At its peak, Enron was trading at around 55 times earnings. That's more like Cisco's once tropospheric valuation than the meager 2.5 times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke Energy. 
But Enron management wanted more. It was, after all, a ""new economy"" Web-based energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded. According to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay, the company deserved to be valued accordingly. At a conference early this year he told investors the company's stock should be trading much higher -- say $126, more than double its price then. 
Then the new economy motor stalled. The company's president left under strange circumstances. And rumors swirled about Enron's machinations in California's energy markets. Investors pored over Enron's weakening financial statements. But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic scholars to penetrate the company's cryptic financials. In effect, Enron's troubles were hiding in plain sight. 
It should have been a warning. Because of the poor financial disclosure there was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company, or how it was trying to make its numbers. Most analysts blithely concede that they really didn't know how Enron made money -- in good markets or bad. 
Not that Enron didn't make money, it did -- albeit with a worrisomely low return on equity given the capital required -- but sometimes revenues came from asset sales and complex off-balance sheet transactions, sometimes from energy-trading revenues. And it was very difficult to understand why or how -- or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter. 
Enron's financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff. Deep inside the company filings was mention of LJM Cayman, L.P., a private investment partnership. According to Enron's March 2000 10-K, a ""senior officer of Enron is the managing member"" of LJM. Well, that was a puzzler. LJM was helping Enron ""manage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar assets by entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars."" It was, in a phrase, Enron's house hedge fund. 
There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market -- it is crucial for a market-maker. But having an Enron executive managing and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether, especially when the Enron executive was the company's CFO, Andrew Fastow. While he severed his connection with LJM (and related partnerships) in July of this year -- and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week -- the damage had been done. 
As stories in this paper have since made clear, Mr. Fastow's LJM partnership allegedly made millions from the conflict-ridden, board-approved LJM-Enron relationship. And recently Enron ended the merry affair, taking a billion-dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJM's wrong-footed hedging. Analysts, investors, and the Securities & Exchange Commission were left with many questions, and very few answers. 
To be fair, I suppose, Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a year ago, saying it had erected a Chinese wall between Fastow/LJM and the company. And in a bull market, no one paid much attention to what a bad idea that horribly conflicted relationship was -- or questioned the strength of the wall. Now it matters, as do other Enron-hedged financings, a number of which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003. 
We didn't do anything wrong is Mr. Lay's refrain in the company's current round of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls. That remains to be seen, but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment, and heroic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial transparency. 
Where has Enron's board of directors been through all of this? What kind of oversight has this motley collection of academics, government sorts, and retired executives exercised for Enron shareholders? Very little, it seems. It is time Enron's board did a proper investigation, and then cleaned house -- perhaps neatly finishing with themselves.

Enron Seeks Additional Financing
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

10/29/2001
The New York Times
Page 9, Column 4
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DALLAS, Oct. 28 -- The Enron Corporation, still struggling to reassure investors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions involving its former chief financial officer, is seeking $1 billion to $2 billion in additional financing from banks, an industry official said today. 
Last week, Enron, the nation's largest energy-trading concern, used about $3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $2 billion to pay off commercial paper. Now, by obtaining even more financing, Enron is hoping to convince investors and other energy-trading firms that it will not face a cash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or do business with it.
Enron's board, which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last two weeks to monitor the company's financial situation, held another meeting this afternoon. ''The board is meeting frequently and will announce any actions when appropriate,'' an Enron spokesman said. 
Two weeks ago, Enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced by $1.2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last week. The company also disclosed about $1 billion in separate write-offs, and it said last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission had made an inquiry into its financial accounting. 
Enron hopes to maintain its investment-grade credit rating, which is crucial to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it. Lately, Enron's bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds, and two major credit-rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the company's rating.

GLOBAL INVESTING: Enron stock plunge deals a heavy blow to mutual funds 
Financial Times; Oct 29, 2001
By AGENCIES: AGENCY MATERIAL and ELIZABETH WINE

Enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week,doing severe damage to mutual funds, the company's largest institutional ownership bloc, and the havoc may continue. 
More than 15 per cent of the 4,000 US equity funds held shares in the embattled company's shares as of the most recent reporting period, according to fund tracker Morningstar. 
Mutual funds held a fifth of Enron's shares, but that percentage is likely to be much lower now, say fund analysts, who suggest much of the stock's halving in October is due to large sales by institutional holders. 
Janus, the growth fund specialist, was the largest institutional shareholder according to the most recent filings, dated June 30, with more than 42m shares representing a stake worth Dollars 2.1bn. 
The stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth Dollars 659m at Friday's closing price of Dollars 15.40. Enron shares dropped 95 cents, or 5.81 per cent on Friday, taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last week on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships created by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. On Friday, several leading rating agencies put the company's debt on credit watches, and Enron bond prices plunged. The company's stock is down 81 per cent since January. 
Most fund managers, including those at Janus, refuse to discuss a company in which they are actively trading. However, several mutual fund groups with large Enron stakes have said their listed positions are ""dated"", implying that the funds' positions in the company have changed. 
Morningstar analyst Christine Benz, who follows the Janus funds, said managers of the group's larger funds had been ""lightening up"" their Enron holdings this year. She said Blaine Rollins, who manages the Dollars 23bn flagship Janus fund, said that in September he had sold some of his stake - listed as 2.15 per cent of outstanding shares as of April 30 - but did not say when. 
Ken Zschappel, manager of the Dollars 11bn Aim Constellation fund, also declined to discuss his holdings, listed as 0.27 per cent of outstanding shares as of March 31. But Aim said the position had since been ""trimmed substantially"". 
Other top fund owners, as of the most recent filings, included the Alliance Premier Growth fund, the Janus Twenty, Janus Mercury and Janus Growth & Income funds, Fidelity Magellan, AXP New Dimensions Fund, Putnam Investors, Putnam Voyager and Putnam New Opportunities funds and Morgan Stanley Dividend Growth fund.

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers.
By SIMON LONDON and SHEILA MCNULTY.

10/29/2001

(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers - Once a paragon of the new economy, the US energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free-wheeling management, write Simon London and Sheila McNulty. 
Enron has some explaining to do. For the past decade or more, the Texas-based company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school professors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast-growing energy trader. Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind.
Its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating multi-million dollar deals with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer, which resulted in a $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity. A hastily-convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these ""related-party transactions"". The departure of Andy Fastow, the aforementioned CFO, soon followed. 
With its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies, Enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines. Yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity. 
""This marks the end of Enron's walk on the wild side,"" observes Curt Launer, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank. 
On the surface, events at Enron can be explained by the combination of deteriorating trading conditions, a complex capital structure and poor investor relations. But the root causes go back further. The entrepreneurial culture and dynamic management that fuelled Enron's growth in the 1990s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis. Therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle ""new economy"" magic on to old economy companies. 
Enron's transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of Jeffrey Skilling, who was hired from McKinsey, the management consulting firm, to develop energy trading. 
For the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulating US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay, a former deputy under-secretary of energy. Mr Lay remains chairman. But it was Mr Skilling who spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying it. 
The two sides of the business - trading and generation/supply - have always been strange bedfellows. The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility. Mr Skilling's answer in the early 1990s was to bring in talent from outside the company. One of his first recruits was Mr Fastow, an expert in securitisation, the repackaging of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets. 
The energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself. A management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice-president, director, manager and associate/ analyst - much like a consulting firm. Employees were free to take as much holiday as they liked, so long as they delivered results. As one of Mr Skilling's early recruits recalled: ""It was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules."" 
The seemingly free-wheeling style was based on a ""loose-tight"" management model expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, the management writers and McKinsey alumni. At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy business were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets. 
Up-and-coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory. Louise Kitchen, the 32-year-old British executive who was the creative force behind Enron Online, the group's internet-based trading platform, changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years. 
Balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of risk, legal commitments, finance and performance evaluation/remuneration. Mr Skilling once described the approach in this way: ""As long as you clear your deals or business ideas through those screens, you can do whatever you want around here."" 
This approach did deliver growth and innovation. As well as making markets in its core energy products, Enron now trades everything from weather derivatives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable climatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals. The success of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world's leading e-commerce company. 
It has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint venture with International Business Machines and America Online, the internet service provider. 
In February this year Mr Skilling got his reward: he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 most powerful US corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as IBM, AT&T, Bank of America and Boeing. 
In retrospect, however, this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was achieved at a price. First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling. In August he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job. Personal, non-health related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanation. 
A second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity. In order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded, Enron used a range of off-balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion. LJM, the private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role, is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enron's accounts. Other financing vehicles include Osprey, Marlin, Whitewing, Atlantic Water Trust and Azurix. ""They went after too many things too quickly,"" says Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency. 
A third cost, associated with the last, was a loss of financial transparency. The group's extensive use of swaps, options and other derivative financial instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have little idea of how Enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to which it is exposed. 
David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, summed up the views of many investors during last week's conference call. He told the group's management: ""The company's credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need for much more disclosure. There is an appearance that you are hiding something or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable."" 
The fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus. ""The problems, in our view, stem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skills,"" argues Raymond Niles, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ""Power plants in India, water companies, extension of their franchise to the mass retail market, and using a fibre-optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated, or only tangentially related, to their core merchant energy business."" 
Enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for some of these ventures. This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enron Broadband was a business worth $35bn ( #24bn) in its own right. This helped push the share price to all-time highs - and storing up trouble when trading volumes failed to materialise. 
""They over-promised on the new business they created,"" says Chris Bartlett, a professor at Harvard Business School and long-time watcher of the company. ""Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the broadband business. To some extent they are now paying the price."" 
Will Enron weather the storm? Notwithstanding the risk of further out-of-the-blue financial shocks, most analysts believe that it will. The merchant energy business remains powerful and profitable. Mr Niles at Salomon Smith Barney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent of earnings and has shown consistent 30-40 per cent annual growth over the past three years. Assets totalling more than $4bn were also earmarked for disposal before the current crisis erupted, underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the group's portfolio of physical energy assets. 
And yet the doubts remain. It is, ultimately, a question of confidence and credibility. Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight management methods has tilted too far towards the former. Mr Lay and his team will have to tighten up.

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS - Enron asks banks for additional credit.
By SHEILA MCNULTY and GARY SILVERMAN.

Enron, the troubled US energy group, was attempting yesterday to persuade banks to provide additional credit to bolster its position after a sharp fall in its share price. 
The Houston-based company was also due last night to hold a special board meeting to consider confidence-building measures after surprise financial disclosures damaged its reputation among US investors.
Last week the company raised $3.3bn (Euros 3.7bn) in cash to bolster its financial position but Enron admitted yesterday that it was still looking for additional finance. The company insisted, however, that it was in good financial health and that its core energy trading business remained strong. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said he hoped the company would have something to announce in coming days from its latest effort to ""establish additional lines of liquidity"". ""Once we are able to get the liquidity position shored up, that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest,"" Mr Palmer said. 
The company's problems have become public since an announcement on October 16 that it would take a $1.01bn special charge and write down shareholders' equity by another $1.2bn. The moves followed losses arising from a private equity operation run by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer, who was forced to take a leave of absence last week. 
Enron's share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the October 16 announcement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically ""junk"" status, though its official ratings are still investment grade. 
""Our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their ability to operate their trading and marketing operations,"" said Raymond Niles of Salomon Smith Barney. ""These activities require at least an investment grade credit rating, or Enron could be subject to an increase in margin requirements."" 
The controversy over Enron's balance sheet adjustment has resulted in a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Enron flickers, Page 22.

Enron Seeks Further Credit to Reassure Investors, WSJ Says
2001-10-29 04:30 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide a further credit line of as
much as $2 billion in a bid to restore investor confidence in the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified
officials close to negotiations.

     The new credit line is additional to the $3.3 billion credit
line it tapped last week, the paper said, and should be completed
within days.

     Investors have shunned the company since Oct. 16 when Enron
reported a third quarter loss of $618 million and wrote down
shareholders' equity by another $1.2 billion, the Journal said.
The stock has fallen by 54 percent since the announcement.

     The company's shares were further dented after an investor
sued Enron last month, saying dealings with two partnerships run
by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, cost the company
$35 million. The suit also called Fastow's leadership of the
partnerships, set up to cut Enron's debt, a conflict of interest.



USA: REPEAT-Electric cowboys get roped in at the energy corral.
By Janet McGurty

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Last year, Enron Corp. was a darling of investors and analysts, but the freewheeling trader of electricity and natural gas now faces a credibility crisis due to a lack of transparency in its business dealings. 
Enron, trying to shake investor jitters over a possible downgrade of its credit worthiness and their unease over the company's complex financial transactions, has seen its shares shed more than half their market value in the past week.
But the largest natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States is not alone in getting its wings clipped as energy prices come down and the market volatility that drove earnings last year eases. 
While Enron's problems differ from more traditional utilities, many other power producers are returning to their roots. They are scrapping plans for splitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy. 
Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amro, said there are common themes affecting the industry. 
""One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth,"" Patterson said. 
As earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward, some power companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment. And plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off. 
Shares of Enron slid $1.05, or 6.4 percent, to $15.30 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. 
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED 
AES Corp. , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consecutive quarter on a poor showing from operations in Brazil and Britain, said Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off assets. 
""It's a different place,"" AES' chief executive officer Dennis Bakke said of the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year's powerful growth. On Friday, Constellation Energy Group , parent company of Baltimore Gas & Electric, scrapped plans to split its power generation and trading operations into two company because of economic changes. Constellation also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with Goldman Sachs, which planned to make an equity investment in the company. 
""The utility industry and energy markets, and indeed the entire U.S. economy, have changed considerably in the past year. As a combined company, we will be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver,"" said Christian Poindexter, Constellation's chairman. 
RETURN TO TRADITIONAL VALUES 
Bakke said one prong of AES's brave, new world scenario was a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term contract generation business. 
It makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 80 percent of their generating capacity into long-term contracts because it provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth, according to Gordon Howald, energy analyst with Credit Lyonnaise. 
""Calpine does it already,"" he said, referring to the California-based independent power producer that has the lion's share of the power it generates contracted out. ""What drove the valuations in all these companies last year was that power markets were very inefficient. Physical reserve margins were low. But with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case - there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywhere near that level,"" he added. 
Howald said with all the new generation coming on, natural gas prices should remain high but power prices should come down further, squeezing spark spreads, or profit margins, for solely gas fired companies. 
SMALLER COMPANIES ALSO RETHINK STRATEGIES 
As lower power prices impact earnings, many power companies are turning back to U.S. markets to try to maximize their bottom line. 
""Earnings for the quarter is not the big deal. The big deal is that for 2002 they are not going to earn as much as people expected. It's a downward revision of earnings guidance."" said Patterson. 
Michigan-based CMS Energy Corp. cut its earnings estimates for the second time to $2 to $2.05 for 2002, down from $2.79 and said it would sell off certain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in North America. 
CMS, whose earnings were down for the third quarter, said it took a charge for planned divestitures, includingdiscontinued South American energy distribution units as well as other international investments. 
Allegheny Energy Inc. also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in third quarter earnings. 
The Maryland-based company said while it is continuing to work towards getting necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold its unregulated assets, it will not proceed with the offering at this time. 
""The company will integrated until market conditions are such that demonstrated value can and will be created for shareholders,"" Allegheny said.

Enron seeks new credit line; reportedly for 1-2 bln usd

AFX (AP)
Copyright 2001 AFX News; Source: World Reporter (TM)

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp is negotiating with banks for a new credit line, a spokesman told the Wall Street Journal. 
The company is in talks to raise between 1-2 bln usd and is likely to close a deal within days, it quoted officials familiar with the matter as saying.
The deal, which is intended to head off a potential loss of investor and business confidence, would supplement existing lines. These are largely tapped out after Enron last week drew down about 3 bln usd to increase cash reserves and calm market fears. 
Enron earlier this month announced a heavy third quarter loss and erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.

Enron Said Seeking New Credit Lines
BY LAURA MANDARO and ALISSA SCHMELKIN

Copyright (c) 2001 Thomson Financial, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The Texas energy and telecommunications giant Enron Corp. was reportedly negotiating with its lenders about new credit lines Friday, a day after it drew down billions on its existing lines. 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are the two banking companies with the largest lending exposure to the $67 billion-asset Houston company, with an estimated $400 to $500 million in bank debt outstanding ""in addition to derivatives and other structured product exposures,"" according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Lori Applebaum.
Morgan Chase and Citi were the book runners on a 364-day, $2.25 billion loan facility to Enron that closed in May, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. Credit Suisse First Boston was the sole bookrunner on a $582 million loan to the company that closed in March and matures in March 2004, the data company said. Bank of America, Citigroup, and Deutsche Bank also participated, Securities Data said. 
On Thursday, Enron issued a statement that ""in order to dispel uncertainty in the financial community,"" it had drawn on its committed lines of credit to provide over $1 billion of cash liquidity. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Enron drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and was in talks about obtaining a new multibillion-dollar line. 
""We continue to have conversations new our creditors about new liquidity -- that's nothing out of the ordinary,"" said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. 
The developments followed a $638 million loss for the third quarter, the departure of Enron's chief financial officer, and a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. 
Enron, a natural gas company that has broadened its focus to include energy trading, transport, risk-management, and telecommunications products and services, has relationships with banks that extend beyond credit lines. 
""Citi, J.P. Morgan, and possibly Wachovia and Bank of America also invested along with Enron in some of its partnerships,"" said Ms. Applebaum. A spokesman for Morgan Chase confirmed that the bank was a lender but said he did not know the amount of its exposure. 
Many other regional banks have participated in credit facilities to Enron. Bank of America Corp. is estimated to have about $200 million to $300 million of exposure; Bank One Corp. about $100 million; and Wachovia Corp., SunTrust Banks Inc., and FleetBoston Financial Corp. about $50 million each, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. Bank of New York has between $50 to $100 million of exposure, and Northern Trust, U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp also have some lending exposure, Ms. Applebaum said. 
Representatives of these banks would not comment on their relationships with Enron, or did not return phone calls by deadline.

USA: Enron in talks for $1-2 bln credit line - WSJ.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. is negotiating with banks for a new credit line of between $1 billion and $2 billion and could close a deal within days, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Monday. 
According to officials close to the situation, the new credit would supplement existing credit lines, largely tapped out after the company drew down about $3 billion last week to increase cash reserves and calm jittery investors' fears, the Journal reported.
The paper said that an Enron spokesman had confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line, but could not supply any further details. 
Confidence in Enron has been shattered following disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships. Its stock has tumbled amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the company's ousted Chief Financial Officer's links to some of the partnerships.

JAPAN: Japan's Teijin, Enron study coal-fired power plant.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japan's major polyester manufacturer, Teijin Ltd , said on Monday it would conduct a feasibility study with U.S. energy giant Enron Corp on building a coal-fired power plant. 
Teijin said in a statement that it and E Power Corp, a Japanese affiliate of Enron Corp, would look into building the 70,000 kilowatt coal-burning thermal power plant in Matsuyama, Ehime prefecture, on the southwestern island of Shikoku, where Teijin has a polyester plant.
""We are beginning to consider selling surplus power to third parties other than our own plants, with eyes on further deregulation in Japan's power market,"" a Teijin spokesman said. 
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last year, large-lot consumers have been free to choose their suppliers. 
In its polyester business, Teijin has expanded overseas output while reducing domestic production, a trend which would leave it with surplus power. It is thus looking at how to make good use of any surplus. 
The two firms were also considering expanding the capacity of Teijin's existing power generator in Matsuyama, Teijin said. It hopes to reduce costs at the inefficient small plant with the help of Enron. 
Enron Corp said earlier this year it had presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a power plant in Japan. 
The Teijin spokesman said the two firms hoped to conclude the feasibility study by June 2002. 
Teijin's shares ended the day down 13 yen or 2.68 percent at 472 yen.

Enron, Teijin to Build Power Plant in Japan, Report Says
2001-10-28 23:39 (New York)


     Tokyo, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. and Teijin Ltd.
will jointly build a coal-fired power plant in southwestern Japan
as early as 2004, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said on its wire
service, without citing sources.

     Enron, the world's biggest energy trader, and synthetic-
fiber maker Teijin will together spend 1 billion yen ($8.16
million) to build the 70,000-kilowatt plant in Ehime, southwest of
Tokyo, the report said.

     Enron wants to eventually build bigger plants and sell
electricity directly to large commercial users without going
through exiting utilities, the report said.

Once-Mighty Enron Strains Under Scrutiny
By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

IS time running out for Enron? 
At the beginning of this year, the Enron Corporation, the world's dominant energy trader, appeared unstoppable. The company's decade-long effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from California to New York. Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its views would be heard in Washington. Its sales, profits and stock were soaring.
And under the leadership of Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive, Enron's arrogance had grown even more quickly. 
The company, based in Houston, dripped contempt for the regulators and consumer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets -- for electricity, water and everything else. Everyone would win under deregulation, Enron said -- especially its shareholders, whose stock would soar as the company profited from creating new markets. 
''We are on the side of angels,'' Mr. Skilling said in March, dismissing those who saw the company as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. ''People want to have open, competitive markets. They want fair competition. It's the American way.'' 
But less than a year later, everybody seems to have lost, especially Enron's investors. Enron's stock is plunging, and questions about its finances are mounting. 
Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens, trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile. In a worst-case outlook, Enron could become the 2001 version of Long-Term Capital Management, the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998. Enron's shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year, erasing $50 billion in shareholder value. 
Enron closed on Friday at $15.40, down 95 cents, after hitting a 52-week low of $15.04 earlier in the day. 
The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt, thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in California earlier this year -- a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation's basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market. Enron's efforts to become a profit-making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures. In August, Mr. Skilling quit, forcing Kenneth L. Lay, his predecessor as chief executive and still Enron's chairman, to resume day-to-day control of the company. 
The company declined to make senior executives, including Mr. Lay, available for comment, and asked that questions be submitted in writing. Mr. Skilling could not be reached. 
Enron's problems boiled over earlier this month, when it disclosed that its shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in Enron's regular financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the company's financial reporting, and some investors question whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas. 
THE slump in the company's shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall in its shareholders' equity. On Wednesday, the company forced out its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who is at the center of the controversy over Enron's confusing finances. The company, which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from California's energy crisis, today faces a potential cash crunch. 
The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors' smoldering concern about Enron's opaque financial statements. Now, with Wall Street analysts and bond-rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company's profits, Enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash. 
Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash. On Thursday, the company drew down a $3.3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, which have each extended at least $400 million. But because of Enron's importance in the natural gas and electricity markets, industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide. 
The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed, because Enron is mainly a trader, rather than a producer, of energy. But a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices, which have swung wildly in the last year. 
Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy-markets economist, emphasized that he thought Enron would survive this crisis. But he said it was not clear what would happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company's EnronOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations. 
''You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there -- are they good? Are the firm's hedges good? What's the situation?'' Mr. Verleger said. ''It's got everyone scared.'' 
In the short run, Enron's credit rating may be its biggest problem. If the company's rating falls below investment grade, Enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed. But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable, because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company. 
A drop in the company's credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with Enron, hurting the company's sales and profits. 
Enron's credit rating stands several notches above the critical point. But its bonds, which are publicly traded, have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent, comparable with many junk bonds. Two of the three major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Investors Service, have put Enron's bonds on review for possible downgrades. 
''The issue that's in the front of everybody's mind right now is credit,'' said Mark Gurley, senior vice president and general manager for trading at Aquila Inc., one of the nation's largest energy traders. Aquila is based in Kansas City, Mo. 
For now, Aquila and other major energy traders and producers, including Reliant Energy, the El Paso Corporation and Dynegy, are continuing to do business with Enron. And Mr. Gurley said that Enron's own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. 
''They haven't done anything trading-wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down,'' he said. 
Still, some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with Enron, especially long-term contracts. They also said risk-management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said on Friday that no energy-trading company had stopped doing business with Enron. He declined to say whether any of the company's trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms. He said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business. 
But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront. For years, the details of Enron's finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street analysts whose job it is to follow the company, and to the investors who own its stock and bonds. When Enron's profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets, shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements. 
Now they do. Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask. 
To others in the industry, the opaqueness of the company's financial statements parallels Enron's efforts to keep its energy-trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements. Though they do not expect Enron to crumble like Long-Term Capital Management, they say that, like the giant hedge fund, Enron uses a lot of debt, regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances. 
The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet. With names like Marlin and Osprey, the partnerships have at least $3.3 billion in bonds outstanding, backed by assets like a stake in Azurix, Enron's water company subsidiary. Enron has promised that if the partnerships' debts exceed the value of their assets, Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference. 
DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr. Fastow, who was chief financial officer when they were organized, led to the $1.2 billion write-off in shareholders' equity that Enron announced last week. The company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships. 
Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter, after being criticized by shareholders. In the process, it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books, reducing its shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion. But, because of complex accounting rules, the transaction was not apparent in Enron's quarterly earnings report. 
The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have found a way to hide losses, throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question. When Enron released third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16, it reported a loss from $1 billion in write-offs on failed investments. The earnings statement did not mention the additional $1.2 billion equity write-down. But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable, and its shares rose. 
In a conference call with analysts after the announcement, Mr. Lay, Enron's chairman, also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity. The reference was a brief one, however, and some listeners did not catch it. Those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done, and many were confused by the accounting procedure. Enron's stock began to slide, and investors clamored for more information about the write-off. But so far, the company's efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors. 
Mr. Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals, but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts about Mr. Lay's grasp of the situation. They say that the two people at Enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals -- Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow -- have both left the company. 
In an interview in late August, Mr. Lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving Mr. Fastow. In response to one question about them, he said, ''You're getting way over my head.'' 
Mr. Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr. Lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue, saying Mr. Lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the S.E.C. investigation. ''There is not a whole lot we can say, or should say, about them,'' Mr. Palmer said. He also said the company expected to generate about $3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year. 
In a conference call on Tuesday, analysts pressed Mr. Lay and other top Enron executives to reveal more information about the LJM write-down and its other partnerships. Instead, they offered only vague explanations of the deal, leaving Wall Street worried that more write-offs might be coming. 
David Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company, was among those who came away concerned. ''If Enron is unable to clarify its off-balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets,'' he wrote in a research note after the call. 
To try to reassure investors, Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline, its Internet-based trading exchange, executed more than 8,400 trades that day, a higher-than-normal volume. 
''We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community -- and we're working on that,'' Mr. Lay said in a statement. ''But in the meantime, the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron.'' 
But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street. Enron's stock tumbled almost 6 percent Friday, to its lowest levels in six years. 
Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off-balance-sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees. 
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates that Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said that Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign assets -- including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India embroiled in a dispute with the state government -- and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring economy. 
''As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs, they may have to write those assets down,'' Ms. Coale said. On Wednesday, she downgraded her rating on Enron to ''sell'' from ''neutral.'' 
''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts,'' Ms. Coale said. 
Short-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company disclosed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than analysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money-losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they say. 
''The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core business, the trading business, is profitable,'' said Mark Roberts, director of research at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May 7, when it stood at $59.43. ''The issue remains: why are they doing these transactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that profitable.'' 
James Chanos, a leading short-seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fall, said, ''Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the losses when deals go against it?'' Mr. Palmer of Enron said the company stood by its reported energy-trading profits. 
Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced -- meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, in roughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy. 
''With these guys, they tell us -- and all you've got is their word -- that they're hedged,'' said Mr. Verleger, the economist. 
IN fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet-trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices. 
Large-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years. Enron pioneered the business, and now dominates it, accounting for about one-quarter of all trading in the United States. 
Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity, a process that began in earnest a decade ago, the power business was a simpler affair. Utilities were given areas of monopoly service, and their rates -- and ability to deliver enough electricity -- were overseen by state regulators. But with the move to deregulate the business, independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished, providing an ever-growing portion of the nation's power. 
Beginning in the 1980's, the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated, spurring Enron, which used to be primarily a gas-pipeline company, to move into the trading business. 
The company's shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid-1990's, with the ascension of Mr. Skilling, who became chief executive in February, just six months before his unexpected resignation. Underscoring the change in direction, in securities filings this year Enron described its principal business as ''security brokers, dealers and flotation.'' Before, it had said it was in the business of ''wholesale-petroleum and petroleum products.'' 
For most of its ascent, Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall Street accepted them with pleasure. A year ago, when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by Mr. Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer, analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr. Fastow's involvement. 
Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch. But the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short-term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring. The controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year -- unless Enron loses its investment-grade credit rating before that. 
ENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions, which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enron's credit. When Long-Term Capital was stumbling in 1998, some Wall Street rivals sold the securities they thought Long-Term owned, trying to force Long-Term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss. Something similar in energy markets might be possible. If so, Enron might find, as Long-Term did, that positions that should offset each other do not. 
Enron's new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company's profits are real, and that its condition is better than the short-sellers believe. As questions are answered, confidence, and the share price, could rebound. 
But for now, investors are skittish, and some competitors are eager to take advantage of Enron's plight.

Plumbing Mystery Of Deals By Enron
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 13, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

AT the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Corporation are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. Because they were transactions among related parties, the company was required to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they answered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the currently available answers. 
Q. Why did Enron enter into the deals?
A. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it said it was seeking to ''hedge certain merchant investments and other assets,'' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommunications companies. 
Q. How did those investments do? 
A. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclosure on that. 
Q. Why can't that be discerned? 
A. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transactions with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivative securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangements completely. 
Q. Why were they so complicated? 
A. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One accounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each and then buys them back -- whether for $1 or $50 -- there is no gain or loss. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet -- in that case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fall under that rule. 
Q. Who made money from these transactions? 
A. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not all of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears that the partnerships distributed money to investors. 
Q. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now? 
A. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted profits each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being disclosed was not really important. 
Q. When were concerns raised with Enron? 
A. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By this summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partnerships. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered related to Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the transactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out its deals with the partnerships. 
Q. How did Enron do? 
A. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transactions involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it also reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. 
Q. How did that happen? 
A. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnership owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enron. In return, Enron terminated ''previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods.'' Enron treated that like a share buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings. 
Q. Is that legal under the accounting rules? 
A. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on them. That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRIS

Investors Seem to Ignore Discouraging News
By MICHAEL BRICK

The New York Times
Page 17, Column 3
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Investors sent stocks markedly higher last week, despite reports on the economy and corporate profits that were resoundingly poor. 
The Dow Jones industrial average, strengthened by triple-digit rallies on Monday and Thursday, ended the week nearly back to its level of Sept. 10, one day before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Broader indicators ended slightly higher than they were on Sept. 10.
Investors overcame their initial discouragement about reports that orders for durable goods and sales of existing homes were deteriorating faster than expected. They also seemed unfazed by reports of corporate profits declining from a year ago, at some companies by more than 30 percent. 
All the bad news, investors seemed to surmise, meant that the government was more likely to act aggressively in stimulating the economy, with tax breaks, spending and lower interest rates. 
The Dow average gained 341.06, or 3.7 percent, to close at 9,545.17. The Nasdaq composite index rose 97.65 points, or 5.8 percent, to 1,768.96. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 31.13, or 2.9 percent, to 1,104.61.

Enron Asks Banks for More Credit After Stock Slide, FT Reports
2001-10-28 20:20 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide further credit after tapping
a $3.3 billion credit line last week to bolster investor
confidence, the Financial Times reported, citing company sources.

     Enron's stock has fallen more than 50 percent since Oct. 17
when an investor sued the company for conflict of interest over
transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow.

     The company has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans since announcing Oct. 16 it would take
a $1.01 billion special charge and write down shareholders' equity
by another $1.2 billion, the FT said.

     Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said he hoped the company would
announce the new financing facility in coming days, the newspaper
said.

The Financial Times quoted Enron spokesman Mark Palmer as saying he hoped the company could have something to announce in coming days as a result of its latest effort to ""establish additional lines of liquidity."" 
""Once we are able to the liquidity position shored up, that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest,"" The Financial Times quoted Palmer as saying.

The vote is in. Lockheed Martin Corp. won the coveted right to build the nation's next-generation fighter aircraft, beating out Boeing Co. for what could be the biggest military contract ever. 
Culminating a five-year battle between two of the world's largest defense contractors, Pentagon officials picked Lockheed Martin to begin development of the Joint Strike Fighter, with plans to purchase 3,000 of the planes at a cost of more than $200 billion.
With the potential for foreign sales topping another $200 billion, the contract is considered the most lucrative in U.S. history. ""This really is the contract of the millennium,"" said Christopher Hellman, analyst with the Center for Defense Information. ""Nothing has or will come close. ""

Ford Settles Lawsuit Over Faulty Part 
In the largest automotive class-action settlement in history, Ford Motor Co. will reimburse customers who paid hundreds of millions of dollars to replace a faulty part that caused their vehicles to stall. 
It was uncertain how many consumers would qualify for reimbursements in the range of $160 apiece. 
The settlement caps six years of litigation. Plaintiffs' lawyers said the cost to Ford would be as high as $2.7 billion.

AMR Posts Record Loss in Quarter 
Even though more Americans are flying again, the airline industry continues to reel and its problems are expected to worsen this holiday season. 
AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, the world's largest airline, posted a record loss for the third quarter, even after getting $508 million in federal financial aid. 
Although the number of passengers has kept growing each week since the Sept. 11 attacks, about 20% fewer people are flying. 
Less than a month before the busy Thanksgiving weekend, American Airlines says advance bookings for November are down 6% from a year earlier. 
Meanwhile, the airlines are now reporting a little-noticed aspect of the government rescue package: They have to pay federal taxes on the cash grants.

ITC Says Imports Hurt Steel Industry 
The International Trade Commission ruled that foreign imports pose a serious threat to the domestic steel industry, paving the way for punitive sanctions that are likely to raise steel prices and intensify trade tensions with Europe and Asia. 
The independent U.S. agency has until mid-December to provide the White House with a list of proposed remedies, which could include import quotas or hefty tariffs on foreign steel. 
Beleaguered U.S. steelmakers applauded the decision. 
President Bush, who instigated the ITC investigation, is expected to approve the protective measures, though critics warn they could harm a weakened domestic economy and complicate efforts to launch a new round of global trade talks. 
Evelyn Iritani 
Shares of Enron Plummet Amid Losses 
Enron Corp.'s stock was pummeled by investors following disclosures of losses and shrinking shareholders' equity related to failed investments and a complicated hierarchy of limited partnerships used to shelter some Enron assets. 
The stock slide was compounded by disclosure of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into two of the partnership arrangements and by Wall Street worries about future cash flow and credit problems that might be caused by the investment vehicles. 
Two conference calls with analysts and investors failed to calm nerves, and several analysts lowered their recommendations on Enron. 
Enron has reiterated that its finances are strong. And although analysts note that Enron's core businesses remain sound, some analysts doubt that the usually taciturn company has revealed all of its problems. 
To mollify investors, Enron replaced its chief financial officer, who until recently headed the two partnerships the SEC is eyeing.

Pentagon OKs Northrop Bid for Newport News 
Northrop Grumman Corp. was all but assured of winning the bid to acquire Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. as the Pentagon endorsed the deal and the Justice Department, citing antitrust concerns, blocked a rival bid by General Dynamics Corp. 
It marked a stunning turn of events for Northrop, which got the nod to acquire the Virginia builder of nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers despite having been the underdog. 
The Los Angeles-based defense contractor made an unsolicited offer for Newport News after the shipbuilder had inked a $2.1-billion deal with General Dynamics. 
Separately, Northrop said third-quarter earnings fell 22% because of a large drop in pension fund investments.

Hollywood Production Jobs Fall to 4-Year Low 
Skittishness following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks has exacerbated an already slow season in Hollywood, pushing employment in the movie, television and film industry to a four-year low in September, state statistics show. 
Cutbacks and delayed projects by the major studios has trickled down through the industry, leading to a spate of layoffs at small companies that provide equipment and services for the industry.

Grammy Officials Urge Greene Settlement 
High-ranking officials at the Grammy organization recommended a settlement of more than half a million dollars to resolve sexual assault and battery allegations against the nonprofit group's chief executive, C. Michael Greene, Grammy sources said. 
The proposed settlement, subject to approval by the group's board of directors, has ignited an internal revolt, with at least a dozen of the 41 trustees privately calling for Greene's firing, the sources said. 
Greene declined to comment. Attorneys for the Grammy nonprofit group previously denied that Greene assaulted or had any sexual contact with Jill Geimer, the Grammy executive who has threatened to sue over Greene's alleged misconduct. 
Chuck Philips 
EMI Ousts Record Label Executive Nancy Berry 
British music conglomerate EMI Group sacked Nancy Berry, the vice chairwoman of its worldwide Virgin Records division. 
Berry's exit came a week after the London-based record company ousted its global record chief, Ken Berry, who is Nancy Berry's former husband. 
The shake-up follows a dispiriting period for EMI, including a disastrous sales debut from pop icon Mariah Carey, who suffered a nervous breakdown months after signing an $80-million contract with the company this year. Nancy Berry spearheaded the elaborate marketing campaign for Carey's album, ""Glitter,"" which has sold fewer than 400,000 copies since its Sept. 11 debut. 
Jeff Leeds 
Management Buyout of G&L Realty Approved 
Stockholders of G&L Realty Corp. approved a management-led buyout of the real estate investment trust despite a higher offer by a rival group and concerns that the deal unfairly favors top executives. 
The company's co-chairmen, Daniel Gottlieb and Steven Lebowitz, plan to take the small Beverly Hills-based company private after a majority of shareholders backed their $12-a-share offer. 
The management-led offer triggered a shareholder lawsuit this year that claimed G&L's board breached its fiduciary duty

Internet Archive Turns Back Web Pages of Time 
The nonprofit Internet Archive launched its so-called Wayback Machine, allowing Web surfers to check out most Internet sites that have vanished and older versions of sites that are still around. 
The San Francisco effort is the brainchild of Brewster Kahle, a millionaire technologist who wants to preserve the Internet's ephemera for generations to come. 
Like many Internet pioneers, however, Kahle faces unfamiliar risks along with the opportunities: the archive might be the most massive violation of copyright law since ownership rights over words came into being. 
More than 10 billion pages are available at http://web.archive.org.

Job Cuts, Make-Over in Store for Sears 
Sears, Roebuck & Co. is getting a new look, borrowing from competitors that have been biting into Sears bottom line. 
In a bid the company says will increase operating income by $1 billion during the next three years, Sears will look more like a mass merchant, with more self-serve areas and centralized checkouts. 
As part of its financial realignment, Sears will cut 4,900 jobs in the next 18 months. 
The company's challenge, analysts say, is to offer something unique within its niche of serving middle-income consumers--an ever difficult proposition against innovative rivals such as Kohl's and Target.

Devon Energy makes building its own with major lease

(Copyright 2001)

HOUSTON is known as the ""Energy Capital of the World."" And a glance around the downtown skyline proves the nickname is appropriate. Houston skyscrapers bearing the names of Enron, Chevron, Exxon and Shell make significant contributions to the view. 
Now another name is being added to the downtown mix, enhancing the energy capital image even further. The 36-story Two Allen Center has been renamed Devon Energy Tower.
Devon Energy has just signed a lease for 193,000 square feet of space, more than doubling its presence in the building, and as part of the deal, Devon gets to put its name on the structure. 
The lease also gives Oklahoma City-based Devon the right to take more space in the 1 million-square-foot building, at 1212 Smith St. 
Devon recently announced its plans to acquire Mitchell Energy & Development, but it will maintain Mitchell's offices in The Woodlands, said Klay Kimker, manager of office administration for Devon. 
Kevin Snodgrass and Tim Relyea of Cushman & Wakefield represented Devon in the transaction. Paul Frazier and Margaret Sigur negotiated the deal on behalf of TrizecHahn Office Properties, the owner of the building. 
TrizecHahn owns both the Allen Center and Cullen Center office complexes, a total of 6 million square feet of space in downtown. The TrizecHahn office space is nearly full right now, but Enron will be vacating large amounts of space there next year when the nearby Enron building is complete. 
Teamsters to build facilities 
Teamsters Union officials are planning to build new headquarters facilities after the union sells its building on the Katy Freeway. 
To replace the Katy Freeway building, the union expects to build two smaller structures near Bush Intercontinental Airport to house different chapters, said A.W. Parker, secretary treasurer of Local 968. 
Parker's group is expecting to build a 13,000-square-foot building at Ella Boulevard at Beltway 8. 
Another Teamsters group has purchased 4.5 acres on Beltway 8 at Diplomatic Plaza Drive, in the World Houston Business Center. The land was purchased from the Licha Family Trust. Tony Patronella and Marc Drumwright, both of Southwest Realty Advisors, handled the sale. 
Chicago firm buying property 
A Chicago real estate investment firm is on a quest to acquire suburban office buildings in Houston. 
ML Capital Ventures has purchased two small office structures: the 71,736-square-foot building at 5500 Northwest Central Drive and the 66,338-square-foot building at 5301 Hollister. The building on Northwest Central Drive is the headquarters of BJ Services energy company. 
Mike Luecht, president of ML Capital, said his firm will acquire two additional Houston office buildings before the end of the year. 
ML Capital, which has been in business for eight months, will exceed Luecht's initial plan to buy more than $22 million worth of suburban office space in Houston in the company's start-up phase. 
Luecht said his firm was bullish on two types of real estate: buying warehouses in Chicago and buying office buildings in suburban Houston. Houston's economy has been adding jobs and it is a promising market that is overlooked by many investors, Luecht said. Many investors have been too slow to forget the devastating meltdown of Houston realty market in the 1980s, Luecht said. 
In its most recent deal, ML Ventures bought the 5500 Northwest Central building in partnership with Avgeris & Associates of Chicago. Tom Bousquet of CB Richard Ellis brokered the deal. 
Woodlands opens new section 
Several $1 million home sites go up for sale this weekend as The Woodlands opens a new section of its Carlton Woods gated community. 
The premium lots will be facing the new Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course. 
Custom lots will range in price from $150,000 to $1 million and range in size from one-fifth of an acre to two-and-three-fourths acres. 
The Carlton Woods community is the first gated community in The Woodlands and has been well received by upper-end home buyers, said Paul Lazzaro, vice president of marketing for The Woodlands. 
Thirty-two homes are under construction in Carlton Woods and all of them are priced at more than $1 million. 
A total of 208 lots have been sold in Carlton Woods, which opened about a year ago.

Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, using $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit. 
An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash.
The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents. 
The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion. 
Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below investment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will be able to sell more commercial paper. 
Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed that its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will show a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wednesday. 
The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked questions about its accounting practices.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron's bond prices drop to warning levels.
By ROBERT CLOW, SHEILA MCNULTY and JENNY WIGGINS.

10/27/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron, the Houston-based energy trading group, continued to pay a heavy price for its lack of financial transparency yesterday as its bond prices plummeted. 
Investor confidence in Enron has declined sharply since the company announced a $1.2bn reduction of shareholder equity stemming from a complex off-balance sheet structure. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also launched an informal investigation into the company's finances.
Enron's five-year bonds were trading yesterday at 77 cents in the dollar with a yield of 11.13 per cent, down from 83 cents on Thursday. Bond prices at these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for bankruptcy. 
Late on Thursday, Enron announced that it would draw on its bank lines to buy back its outstanding commercial paper after two ratings agencies put the company on negative watch. 
Commercial paper financing, which normally has to be rolled every 90 days, is one of the first forms of financing to disappear in a crisis. 
""What they want to do is assure their clients and other trading partners that they are creditworthy and continue with business,"" said Robin West, chairman of the Petroleum Finance Company, the industry consultants. ""In a situation like this, cash is king."" 
Enron's biggest immediate business risk is that its major trading counterparties, such as Duke Energy and Reliant Resources, start asking it for more collateral, increasing the cost of its everyday business. 
If Enron were downgraded to junk, the counterparties could do just that. 
So far, credit rating analysts say, Enron's core business is holding up well. But their actions over the past few days acknowledge that the company could still be severely damaged by the scandal. 
Enron has long faced criticism of its opaque financial reporting, but its most recent problems stem from the LJM private equity fund run by Andy Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer. 
Enron compensated its partners in this complex off-balance sheet structure by promising to give them Enron shares, if the value of private equity investments in The New Power Company, technology and other things fell below a certain level. 
Those investments fell $1.2bn in value from the threshold level, which should have triggered the issue of 62m shares if the deal had not been reversed. 
The complex deal was designed to make sure Enron did not experience the same balance sheet volatility that JP Morgan Chase and others have suffered from marking their private equity investments to market.

Enron taps credit line; stock slides

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - After Enron Corp. tapped into more than $3 billion in credit in an effort to boost confidence of investors and customers, stock prices dropped. 
Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday. Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month.
The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value. 
Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short-term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 
""Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 
Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as ""good management decisions."" 
On Oct. 16 Enron's third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 
The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron. 
Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 
Reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 
""It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations,"" Feygin told the Houston Chronicle for Saturday's editions. 
Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 
""Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message,"" she said. ""Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management.""

Enron Decline Continues

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3-billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-interest, short-term loans. 
The company's stock has fallen 54% in the last 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Investors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. 
""Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,"" said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. ""People are questioning the credibility of management."" 
The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 
The price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of BBB+, yield 9.53%. 
Investors have grown concerned that the firm's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions. 
Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ""a smart financial move,"" said Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service. ""It took away the hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital.""

Enron taps credit line; stock slides / Company says cash will boost confidence

Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday after it tapped into more than $3 billion in revolving credit in an effort to re-assure investors and customers. 
Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month. The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value.

The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short- term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 
""Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 
Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as ""good management decisions."" 
Enron's most recent woes began Oct. 16 when its third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 
The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company's newer businesses such as broadband trading. 
Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 
Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper. This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer, and often with more flexible terms. 
""To some extent, redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets, which look at it negatively,"" said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 
But reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, he said. 
""It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations,"" Feygin said. 
Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 
""Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message,"" she said. ""Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management."" 
Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned. 
In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron. That could lead to lower credit ratings, which would force Enron's energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it. 
""Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues,"" Dietert wrote in a report Friday. ""Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off."" 
Feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store. 
For example, a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco. It was formed in 1997 with about $400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets. 
Chewco was run by Michael Kopper, a managing director of Enron's Global Equity Markets Group.

Enron says Microsoft breached contract

(Copyright 2001)

Enron Corp. filed suit against Microsoft Corp. in state district court in Houston this week, claiming the software giant breached a contract over a new high-speed Internet service. 
The companies entered into an agreement last June in which Enron would provide Internet bandwidth to Microsoft as it rolled out its MSN Broadband service. Enron's broadband network would link MSN customers in over two dozen states, including Texas.
Qwest Communications is providing the Internet infrastructure in 14 other states for MSN. 
On Oct. 23, Microsoft said that Enron would have breached the contract if it didn't provide an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, according to Bloomberg News. In the lawsuit, Enron claims Microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system it needed to deliver its end of the project's first phase. 
The lawsuit appears to be blocking the launch of the MSN service in all but the 14 states served by Qwest. 
Enron officials declined to comment. A Microsoft spokesman said the company had not reviewed the filing but was ""confident that we have upheld our agreement with Enron.""

How to Lose a War
By Frank Rich

10/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 19, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Welcome back to Sept. 10. 
The ''America Strikes Back'' optimism that surged after Sept. 11 has now been stricken by the multitude of ways we're losing the war at home. The F.B.I. has proved more effective in waging turf battles against Rudy Giuliani than waging war on terrorism. Of the more than 900 suspects arrested, exactly zero have been criminally charged in the World Trade Center attack (though one has died of natural causes, we're told, in a New Jersey jail cell). The Bush team didn't fully recognize that a second attack on America had begun until more than a week after the first casualty. The most highly trumpeted breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists -- Tom Ridge's announcement that ''the site where the letters were mailed'' had been found in New Jersey -- proved a dead end. And now the president is posing with elementary-school children again.
Given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with C.E.O. clockwork, perhaps it should be added to the growing list of Things That Have Changed Forever since Sept. 11. But let's not be so hasty. Not everything changes that fast -- least of all Washington. The White House's home-front failures are not sudden, unpredictable products of wartime confusion but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan. 20. 
This is an administration that will let its special interests -- particularly its high-rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the right -- have veto power over public safety, public health and economic prudence in war, it turns out, no less than in peacetime. When anthrax struck, the administration's first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as speedily as possible to protect Americans, but to protect the right of pharmaceutical companies to profiteer. The White House's faith in tax cuts as a panacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week's House ''stimulus'' package showering $254 million on Enron, the reeling Houston energy company (now under S.E.C. investigation) that has served as a Bush campaign cash machine. 
Airport security, which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since Sept. 11, is also held hostage by campaign cash: As Salon has reported, ServiceMaster, a supplier of the low-wage employees who ineptly man the gates, is another G.O.P. donor. Not that Republicans stand alone in putting fat cats first. In a display of bipartisanship, Democrats -- lobbied by Linda Hall Daschle, the Senate majority leader's wife -- joined the administration in handing the airlines a $15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in the salaries of the industry's C.E.O.'s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees. 
To see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security, you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation -- and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ridge. 
Mr. Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader -- a successful governor of a large state (Pennsylvania) who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam. A close friend of George W. Bush, he should have been in the administration from the get-go, and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs, including the vice presidency. But after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights, he got zilch. Instead of Mr. Ridge, the administration signed on the pro-life John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson -- who have brought us where we are today. 
The farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations -- though Mr. Thompson often comes across as a Chamber of Commerce glad-hander who doesn't know his pants are on fire, and Mr. Ashcroft often shakes as if he's not just seen great Caesar's ghost but perhaps John Mitchell's as well. Both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration. They've seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No. 1 concern. 
Pre-Sept. 11, Mr. Thompson, in defiance of science, heartily lent his credibility to the Bush administration's stem cell ''compromise'' by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers. Post-Sept. 11, he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat, also in defiance of science. Now he maintains that the $1.5 billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system -- almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals, not shoring up local hospitals -- is adequate for fighting bioterrorism. This, too, is in defiance of all expert estimates, including that of the one physician in the Senate, the Republican Bill Frist. 
It should also be on Mr. Thompson's conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government's house physician -- David Satcher, the surgeon general and a much-needed honest broker of public health -- locked away, presumably because Dr. Satcher, a Clinton appointee, became persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right. Only after Mr. Ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag. 
As for Mr. Ashcroft, he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons. Planned Parenthood, which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them, has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one. This was true not only before Sept. 11 but, says Ann Glazier, Planned Parenthood's director of security, remains true -- even though her organization, long targeted by such home-grown Talibans as the Army of God, has a decade's worth of leads on ''the convergence of international and domestic terrorism.'' 
Ms. Glazier found the sight of Mr. Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops offering a $1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy. ''Religious extremists don't respond to money,'' she points out. Such is the state of the F.B.I., she adds, that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days ''because we have so many here we're afraid we're going to lose it'' (perhaps among the Timothy McVeigh documents). 
If either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that, say, Mayor Giuliani does, there wouldn't have been a need to draft Mr. Ridge. Even so, he's mainly a P.R. gimmick -- a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights. As director of homeland security, he's allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agencies -- so far with roughly a dozen staff members. When asked to define Mr. Ridge's responsibilities, Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it was ''a very busy coordination job,'' but so far Mr. Ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion. 
The one specific duty that he has claimed -- in an interview with Tom Brokaw -- was that he'd be the one ''making the phone call'' to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers. That presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld, who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly codified days after Mr. Ridge's appointment. 
Since the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan, we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here -- even as Mr. Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Taliban, once expected to implode in days, are proving Viet-Cong-like in their intractability. The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that ''instead of a thankful Afghan population, popular support for the Taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the U.S. growing.'' 
Maybe we're losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because the Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a C.E.O. (from Madison Avenue) chosen not for her expertise in policy or politics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head & Shoulders shampoo. If we can't effectively fight anthrax, I guess it's reassuring to know we can always win the war on dandruff.

City - Enron directors cash in shares.
By Simon English.

The Daily Telegraph

(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001

LEADING executives at Enron, the troubled US energy giant, cashed in shares worth more than $100m ( #70m) this year in the run-up to a financial crunch that has left the company's credibility in ruins. 
Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay, chief executive, sold about 400,000 shares this year, netting him more than $25m. He still held 2.8m shares until July.
Other executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by July. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron declined to comment on the share sales. 
Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to ""dispel uncertainty in the financial community"" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enron's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep another $800,000 in cash. He said: ""We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community."" 
The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission into partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. 
Mr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to restore confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong. 
Enron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called ""failed investments"".

INDIA: Lenders to meet over Enron's Dabhol on Nov 3.

10/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Lenders to power plant in India majority owned by Enron Corp have called a meeting next week in London to discuss ways of reviving the beleaguered project, a banking source said on Saturday. 
They will examine offers that two Indian companies have put forward for buying the U.S. energy giant's 65 percent stake, and those of two other U.S. firms, in Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is building the controversial project, the source told Reuters.
The meeting of lenders, who include multinational banks such as Citibank and Bank of America , will be held on November 3, the source added. 
At stake is not just the fate of the $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which is India's largest foreign direct investment, but also the over $600 million investment of Enron, General Electric Co and Bechtel. 
All three companies are founders of DPC, which in 1995 got permission from India's Maharashtra state government to set up the plant on its coast. 
The plant's first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1999, but work on the second phase of 1,444 MW, which is 97 percent complete, was abruptly stopped in June this year following a blazing row with cash-strapped state utility MSEB. 
MSEB, which agreed in 1995 to take the plant's entire output, said it can no longer do so because Dabhol's power is too costly. 
Dabhol, in turn, accused MSEB of defaulting on its monthly payments and served a preliminary notice to terminate the power purchase contract. 
Under this notice, both companies are given six months time to settle the matter through negotiations. If talks fail, Dabhol has the right to issue a final termination notice and take the matter to arbitration in London. That six month period expires on November 19. 
Houston-based Enron, which owns 65 percent of Dabhol, further announced that it intends to exit the project and offered to sell its equity to the Indian government. 
TIME RUNNING OUT 
The Business Standard newspaper reported that next week's meeting would also discuss a request by Dabhol to finally terminate the contract after November 19. 
""It is one of the items on the agenda,"" the paper quoted a senior banker as saying. 
The paper said once Dabhol serves the final notice, the matter proceeds to arbitration, which would not help India. 
""The widespread view among the government and lenders is that in such a situation DPC will win hands down,"" the paper added. 
A Dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately. 
The source said the meeting would review the progress made in resolving the dispute so far. 
The Indian government has not responded to Enron's offer to buy its equity, but two Indian companies, BSES Ltd and Tata Power Ltd , have shown interest. 
They have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced, and if the founders agree to sell their stake at a discount. 
Local business daily, the Economic Times reported on Friday that Tata Power and BSES are willing to pay the founders $450-$600 million for the 85 percent stake held by Enron, GE and Bechtel. 
Enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less than $1 billion, the paper added. 
Officials of Tata Power and BSES were not immediately available for comment.

Enron sues Microsoft for breach of contract ; Move could block high-speed service

(Copyright 2001)

HOUSTON -- Enron has sued Microsoft, alleging it breached a contract for broadband services, in a move that could temporarily block the largest software company's MSN high-speed Internet service in some U.S. regions. 
Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company from providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron provides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in the 14 states -- including Washington -- where Qwest Communications International operates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.
Enron's lawsuit was filed Thursday, the same day Microsoft had planned to offer fast Internet access in 45 cities to give it access to potential customers in 29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner. 
""We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron, as quickly as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other providers,"" Visse said. 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing company policy on pending litigation. Enron, based in Houston, is the largest energy trader. 
Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide bandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow Jones news wire reported. 
Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of the deal, Dow reported. 
Alternative browser-users denied Microsoft entry 
NEW YORK -- Microsoft's premier Web portal, MSN.com, denied entry to millions of people who use alternative browser software such as Opera and told them to get Microsoft's products instead. 
The decision led to complaints from the small but loyal Opera community that Microsoft was abusing its status as the Internet's browser leader. Microsoft later backed off and said yesterday that it would support the other browsers after all. 
Browser products affected by the shutout, which was triggered by a face-lift of the MSN.com Web site, included Opera, Mozilla and Amaya, said Kevin Reichard, editorial manager for Internet.com's BrowserWatch site. 
Mike Pettit, president of ProComp, an anti-Microsoft group, urged state and federal investigators to look into the matter as part of its lawsuit accusing Microsoft of anti-competitive practices.

MicrosoftSF to shut down; Sony will run retail store 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Sony will take over a retail store it manages with Microsoft next month, when the biggest software maker's Xbox goes up against Sony's PlayStation 2 in a contest for control of the $20 billion video-game market, a Sony spokeswoman said. 
The two companies agreed to shut down MicrosoftSF, a retail outlet in Sony's San Francisco Metreon entertainment complex. It will be replaced with a Digital Solutions electronics store run by Sony on Thursday, Metreon spokeswoman Kirsten Maynard said. 
In April 1998, the companies said they would open the store that displays and sells Microsoft products alongside Sony electronics that run the software. In March 2000, Microsoft announced the Xbox, a game console with an advanced-graphics chip that goes on sale Nov. 15. 
""A lot has changed with both companies,"" Maynard said. ""It sort of became not-a-fit anymore."" 
Sony Metreon won't carry the Xbox or Game Cube, a new video console from Nintendo that goes on sale Nov. 19, she said. Officials at Microsoft couldn't be reached for comment on the shutdown.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Subject:	NOxTech Performance
Importance:	High

Yesterday we tried pushing the NOxTech perfromance for the first time on the 30 MW boiler at Mitsui Babcock's Technology Centre.  We achieved

Aprroximately 0.09 lb/mmBtu at less than 2 ppm ammonia slip, and
approximately 0.07 lb/mmBtu at less than 5 ppm ammonia slip.

We have indications that the kinetic limit for this process is lower than we first guessed, and probably extends down to 21 ppm NOx outlet or approximately 0.03 lb/mmBtu.  This all means that we are able to compete commercially with SCR systems on efficiency and cost, and meet all prospective NOx control regulations except in the very worst ozone non-attainment areas.

We are continuing testing to further evaluate the control system for the chemical injection grid.  Once that is completed, we will reposition the grid to study the effectiveness of injecting through the tubebanks, without incurring the expense of opening a dedicated cavlity.  I will be returning as planned on Wednesday.

Congratulations team, you've just made the world a safer place for air-breathing mammals everywhere!!!

"FW: Organization Announcement - EEL wants to join our global LNG effort","Mike,

I had a short conversation with Michael Brown regarding this organizational announcement.  As you can see, Eric Shaw is now responsible among other areas LNG terminal development in Europe.  Michael explained that this expansion of EEL's efforts was at the initiative of John Sheriff.  He recommended that you and John have a conversation in order to agree on our groups responsibilities and efforts.  As per our 2002 plan we have already begun the review of Europe to determine the economic feasibility of a terminal with the objective of making a determination in Q1 2002.

I agree with Michael in that it would be my preference for you and John to iron this out as opposed to having conflicts at the working levels among our groups.  Obviously, we need the EEL gas desk to make a sharp market for current and future LNG deliveries.

My pitch to John would be that we would like to have a similar relationship with EEL as we do with ENA.  (i.e. they make a market for pipeline gas and we develop terminals, we take terminal positions, we build and manage the global Enron merchant portfolio, etc.)  Two obvious benefits to our current structure are a coherent global LNG strategy and one risk book to manage the associated business risks.

Regards,
Eric

our agent just called in to say that the view in the unions is they will vote this weekend to extend the strike past sunday, as the only way to twist petrobras' arm.
he says they will not be able to shut down the refs but will lower the wick to the absolute minimum allowed by law, which means about a 40pct reduction in distillate production.

Subject:	petrobras update

just talked to marcello castilho, the head of petrobras office in london.  he gave me the following:
their crude production is down by 900mbd.  they have crude and product stocks for the next 5 days, but then will need to buy. initially the thought wud b to buy crude however, the situation may have worsened at the refineries.
he was pessimistic about the discussions. said that petrobras called them to a meeting ydy as everyone knows and only upped the ante by 1pct on their side vs the 8.5 sought plus the inflation catch-up of 42pct. this really angered the unions and they have now said they will not come back to the table before seeing the numbers next time.  he said petrobras is up against internal competition now from other oil and gas companies who are offering ex petrobras workers a 15pct increase over their current pay, so petrobras is in a poor position.

so far the refs have been running at very low rates and the managers have not allowed the workers to leave the prmeises but have bunked them and fed them their in 12 hour shifts. by law they can only do this for 3 days and some fighting has already broken out at one location, so doubtful they can continue the 'imprisonment' much longer.

if it comes to a bigger showdown he thinks the unions will just shut the refs down on the last shift that they work, and he will be buying product not crude.

In the wake of what is happening with Enron's stock price and the publicity about the LJM partnership among other issues, we will be providing a daily report to you on what the press, our competitors and the analysts are saying about Enron.  There is clearly a lot of information out there - some good, some bad - and we want to make sure you are seeing as much of it as possible in an effort to keep you appraised of the latest actions being taken by the business.

The information contained within these reports is for each of you to distribute as necessary to your team members.  There are understandably a lot of questions that our staff has about the health of the business and, while we may not be in a position to answer all of their questions, the more information you can share with your teams, the further we can go in putting their concerns about the business to rest.

On a separate, but related note, we have put together some talking points for use by our traders and originators in addressing concerns raised by counterparties about the current issues Enron is facing.  We have a lot of positive things to say about the business, but we want to ensure that we are consistent in the messages we are giving to our counterparties.  To this end, we would ask that you distribute these messages as necessary to your team members.

Thank you.

            Importance:  High

            I've got 2 samples of fabric.  1 plain off white and the other
   a
         ribbed
            off
            white.  Elizabeth and I prefer the ribbed.
            Plain = $40 retail / $20 cost
            Ribbed = $50 retail  / $25 cost x 34 yards = $850
            I'll give them to you at cost so that we can continue
   furnishing
      your
            house
            ( I hear it's empty).
            If you have time this afternoon and can walk down to your Lobby
   I
      can
            meet
            you there to show you the fabrics.  Also, bring down a check so
      that
         I
            can
            stop by Walter Lee Culp and order you couches and fabric
   ma?ana.
         Fabric
            can
            be overnighted if needed or sent 2 day.
            I think 2 day is plenty of time.

            50% now - (not including taxes)
            50% later + shipping and taxes when couches are ready for
   delivery
         (6-8
            wks.).

            Need now
            $5445 for 2 loveseats and 1 couch + $850 for fabric = $6295
            I will give you a receipt.
            Let me know when you can see the fabric........
            Tina

               Retail for couch is $5460 (saving $1170 about  27% lower)
               Retail for loveseat $4200 (saving $900 about 27% lower.)
               I may be able to save you more on the fabric if I can find
   the
      one
            you
               need
               at Kravets since they give me 50% off.  The majority of the
         furniture
               stores
               only give between a 20-30% off.  The couches take about 6-8
      weeks
         if
               they
               are in stock and usually are.  I'll get some fabric this
   Friday
            during
               lunch
               and maybe I can show you over coffee that afternoon.  I'll
   need
      to
            order
               the
               fabric so add another 2 weeks at least before the store gets
      it.
            Also,
               I'll
               find out paying conditions but usually is 50% upfront (cash)
      and
         then
               the
               other 50% when ready for delivery.  They don't take credit
      card.
            Checks
               payable to me and I pay with my company check.
               I'll get moving and call you on Friday.
               Sound good?

                  8.25% tax = $626.18.
                  Total = $8,216.18.  Both w/out fabric.

                  You need a total of 23.5 yards of fabric.  I usually get

         a

"","Jeff,

As discussed yesterday, provided below is the note I mentioned.  Please call to discuss.  I would like to get this inter-company relationship agreed today.

Eric      x52711





In an effort to promote an internal operating business structure that maximizes the value opportunities for Enron in respect to European LNG activities, provided below is an agreed group interaction protocol.

Defined points of contact
LNG's European commercial lead:	Clay Harris
Continental Commercial Nat Gas lead:	Steve Sapling

Clay Harris and Steve Asplin shall meet at a minimum weekly to discuss current ongoing business and relevant future transaction prospects.  

Prospective transactions with existing European LNG Market Participants
The LNG group shall continue to advance the execution of Master LNG Purchase and Sales Agreements with these relevant European LNG players: Distrigas, Tractabel, GdF, Gas Natural, Repsol, Enagas, Botas, Enel, SNAM/ENI, Edison, Iberdrola, Union Fenosa, Endesa, etc.  Clay Harris and Steve Asplin will coordinate these activities, which will be further coordinated with the relevant EEL country representatives.  The LNG group shall always use Steve Asplin and these relationship managers to coordinate meetings to discuss LNG opportunities on a regional and global basis.  An invitation to join these meetings should and shall always be extended to both groups when LNG opportunities are to be discussed.  European ex-ship LNG transactions shall not require intermediation by the EEL nat gas trading desk. However, the LNG group shall always keep the relevant EEL trading desks aware of the proposed transactions in advance. 

LNG Sales into France and Belgium
The groups will maintain daily contact regarding prospective LNG terminal capacity positions and LNG sales.  The two group's main short term interaction objective shall be for the facilitation of market making for the prospective LNG deliveries by the LNG group.  An important factor that all parties must appreciate is that Enron's activities in Belgium are extremely sensitive to relationship issues with Distrigas.

LNG Sales into Spain
At this point in its development, the natural gas market in Spain is unique to other continental markets given the limited access to source pipelines and the significant market share of LNG.  As such, a coordinated effort to source, create and execute transactions is imperative for Enron's success.  To create an atmosphere of thorough communication, the EEL nat gas group will ensure that an invitation is extended to the LNG group for its gas marekting meetings and discussions, and that the LNG group is completely informed regarding potential transactions.  The LNG group will ensure that the EEL nat gas group is kept fully informed and included in potential sourcing activities.  The overriding goal shall be to ensure that transactions are completed that create the maximum possible value for Enron Corp.

Current Proposed Spanish Transaction
As discussed above, in order to capture the current prospective transaction opportunities in Spain, EEL and Global LNG have agreed to jointly take the proposed length position (0.7BCM/yr for 2 to 5 years) in Spain.  The P&L shall be managed on a complete open book basis (i.e. groups will exchange all relevant term sheets associated with LNG purchases, nat gas sales, re-gas and transit costs, and shipping).  Any margins generated shall be split between the groups.  Determination of the relevant margins shall take into account the market value of LNG groups prior existing LNG charter positions, as well as prior existing EEL  trading desk positions nat gas group.  

The final determination of the value split shall be made on a fully open book basis by Eric Gonzales and Eric Shaw.

Hi Jeff,
Your lamp was picked up by UPS on Friday, November 16. It is traveling UPS
Ground (tracking # 1z 150 x09 03 3938 7453). With the holiday week, I would
expect you'll get it just post-Thanksgiving. Let us know if we can do
anything else. Have a great holiday.

"RE: petrobras update","our agent just called in to say that the view in the unions is they will vote this weekend to extend the strike past sunday, as the only way to twist petrobras' arm.
he says they will not be able to shut down the refs but will lower the wick to the absolute minimum allowed by law, which means about a 40pct reduction in distillate production.

just talked to marcello castilho, the head of petrobras office in london.  he gave me the following:
their crude production is down by 900mbd.  they have crude and product stocks for the next 5 days, but then will need to buy. initially the thought wud b to buy crude however, the situation may have worsened at the refineries.
he was pessimistic about the discussions. said that petrobras called them to a meeting ydy as everyone knows and only upped the ante by 1pct on their side vs the 8.5 sought plus the inflation catch-up of 42pct. this really angered the unions and they have now said they will not come back to the table before seeing the numbers next time.  he said petrobras is up against internal competition now from other oil and gas companies who are offering ex petrobras workers a 15pct increase over their current pay, so petrobras is in a poor position.

so far the refs have been running at very low rates and the managers have not allowed the workers to leave the prmeises but have bunked them and fed them their in 12 hour shifts. by law they can only do this for 3 days and some fighting has already broken out at one location, so doubtful they can continue the 'imprisonment' much longer.

if it comes to a bigger showdown he thinks the unions will just shut the refs down on the last shift that they work, and he will be buying product not crude.

Nick and Mark-

per our call last week, we now have our sources engaged on the following background and questions:

Essentially, E-Power Japan, an Enron subidiary appears to be embroiled in a potentially serious FCPA situation as a result of actions taken by one of its counter-parties, Taisei Engineering.

The former (as of Sept.17th) CEO of E-Power Japan is named Tetsuro Seguchi.  Seguchi formed an ""understanding"" with a Japanese company called Taisei Engineering.  The CEO of Taisei Engineering is named Kyuji Takahashi and the General Manager of Taisei is named Koichi Hosokawa.  These individuals were the primary contacts at Taisei for E-Power Japan and Seguchi.  

The nature of the ""understanding"" between Seguchi and Taisei appears to have been that Taisei would help E-Power get site licenses for constructing generators from local prefecture politicians.  Taisei would then get the operations and maintenance contracts for the E-Power operated generators.  It is not clear that these contracts would automatically go to Taisei, but given the rest of the story and what we know about the Japanese construction industry, these types of anticompetitive practices are hardly unheard of and were probably part of the understanding. 

Our Tokyo office believes that these arrangements were struck by Seguchi without the knowledge of the Enron employees seconded to E-Power Japan. The senior Enron man at E-Power was Kerry Sloan.  Another E-Power local hire, a VP named Kuwubara, may also have been involved.

Enron Japan first became aware of the Taisei problem when the new leadership of E-Power met with a local politician in Aumori Prefecture who had been helping E-Power Japan.  The politician mentioned casually that he ""had not been paid for a while."" This caused Enron Japan concern about FCPA violations.  Enron Japan discovered that E-Power Japan had struck two contracts with Taisei: one a ""plain vanilla"" consulting contract which has now expired and the other a more troubling consulting contract for Taisei to help E-Power Japan get a site location for a generator in Onuta Prefecture.

The political ""patron"" of Taisei Engineering is senior LDP politician Shizuka Kamei--runner-up in the LDP leadership last time around and one of the real insiders in Japan.  Seguchi and Taisei apparently used Kamei to pressure local government officials in Oita Prefecture on the northern island of Kyushu.  A deal of some kind was struck and Enron Japan/E-Power would now like to back away from the deal, both because of FCPA concerns and because the deal is not economically viable.  The northern grid is not an attractive investment for Enron Japan and there are problems bringing the power to the southern island of Honshu.

After all that, here is what we need:

1.	Background on the relationship between Taisei and the LDP, especially Kamei.

2.	Details on the links between Taisei and Japanese organized crime.

3.	Reputational information regarding Tetsuro Seguchi and Kyuji Takahashi, particularly ties to criminal groups or corrupt politicians.

4.	Possible political consequences for Enron Japan and E-Power Japan if we back away from the Oita deal, Kamei, and Taisei.

5.	Possible organized crime/security consequences for Enron Japan and E-Power Japan if we back away from the Oita deal, Kamei, and Taisei.

6.	Whether there are any links between the Taisei relationship and the ""E-Rex"" website articles published by ""Sato"" that criticized Enron Japan and E-Power.  One hypothesis is that the articles are a warning by an organized crime group to Enron.

7.	General reputational information concerning how Enron Japan and E-Power are perceived by the Japanese political and banking/energy industry elite.


We are expecting an initial report this Friday. It would be helpful for our investigators if you could send an electronic file of the Japanese language version of the E-Rex articles you sent to me a couple of weeks ago.

Let me know if the above is correct.

Thanks,

RJ

"The Austin Group Energy, L.P.","As an industry, the generation business has gradually moved from an
environment focused on surplus reserve requirements to one of highly
volatile prices and robust generation margin spikes.  As this shift has
occurred, the industry has had to adopt many of the risk management
practices employed in other commodity industries.  For the most part, these
risk management practices have their genesis in the financial markets, where
sophisticated tools have also been developed to measure the success of these
practices.

The most commonly recognized measure of profit exposure to unforeseen events
has been Value at Risk (VAR).  This Wall Street metric measures the
statistically supported loss exposure of a portfolio of assets and forward
positions to a short-term negative turn of events.  While this is a very
useful measure of a speculative trading portfolio, its value does not
translate easily to measuring exposure of generation assets to profit
erosion.

Savvy power companies are deploying an additional risk metric, Profit at
Risk, to more accurately assess risks specific to the volatile electricity
trading market.  A key feature of PAR is that, unlike VAR, it assumes that
positions will be taken through to delivery rather than closed out.  The
full financial risk of highly volatile spot prices and volume risks
including unplanned outages, sudden increases in demand and delivery
failures by contract partners, is comprehended in this metric.

A blend of VAR and PAR risk metrics will create links between the front,
middle and back office trading operations, allowing traders to operate
within established risk parameters that both protect the enterprise and
maximize trading profits.

"Messages of the Season from Bob Sherrer, Chairman and President o	f Tom James","
Throughout this holiday season we have been reminded by press and media of
the changes to our lives' normality because of the events these last few
months.  When we travel we observe uniformed soldiers and added security
that tell us our way of living and business conduct has forever changed.

The messages of this holiday season, Hope, Peace, Love and Joy have
significant meaning.  All our hearts desire these feelings to endure.
Perhaps like never before we should commit to be instruments that bring
Hope, Peace, Love and Joy to our country and to our world.  Our faith in
those principles and ideas that have carried us and made us great has been
renewed.  Our resolve to make a difference in every endeavor has been
strengthened.  We know we will get better after being in the valley of
adversity and trial.

Tom James Company and all our employees across the United States, the United
Kingdom, Japan and Holland join me in thanking you for your business in
2001.  We have been tested and we are strengthened.  Our partners, who call
on you, are better equipped entering 2002 than ever before to serve you.  We
have significantly added quality products in all our price points and
expanded our casual wear.  The addition in 2001 of the finest footwear made
in the world has given us the highest quality footwear product available.

Our partners in our 11 factories have been touched by the events of
September 11th and after.  Most of our manufacturing facilities are in the
Northeast part of the United States.  Tom James, like so many others,
experienced loss.  So, going forward forever in our memories will be the
faces and pictures of 2001.

Our commitment to you is to be better and our obligation to life is to give
back to life with what we are and who we become.  Your patronage is very
important to Tom James.  Please let us know when we do not perform to your
expectation.  Our guarantee is 100% satisfaction.  We live by our creed.

Thank you for helping us enjoy a fine year.  We will pursue excellence in
serving you, our valued client.  Best wishes for your continued health,
happiness and prosperity in the New Year.

Happy Holidays!
Respect and Regards
Robert F. Sherrer
Chairman and President, Tom James Company

"FW: Phillips meeting and tour","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Leach, Doug  
Sent:	Wednesday, October 24, 2001 9:36 AM
To:	Nowlan Jr., John L.; Maffett, Randal; Goughary, Jim; Lawyer, Larry
Cc:	Robinson, Ted
Subject:	Phillips meeting and tour

Yesterday Ted Robinson, Joe Richards and myself meet with the following people form Phillips Petroleum Company:

Don Halter, Business Manager, Fuel Development Programs
Larry Shoemaker, Technical Manager, Fuel Development Programs
Bill Burns, Chief Process Engineer
Kent Anderson, Project Manager, Technology and Project Development

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Phillips HF technology and to tour the Morgan's Pt. plant. Our discussion focused on the Phillips HF technology which uses a hydrochloric acid process versus a sulfuric acid process to produce alkylate. CAs between EOTT and Phillips as well as between EGM and Phillips are being circulated, so we can further evaluate a possible JV and conversion of the MTBE plant to an alkylate plant. Phillips is convinced they can get the necessary permitting and they stressed the fact that this is proven technology and not new technology. The HF technology has been in use at the Phillips Woods Crossing, Utah refinery and the ExxonMobil refinery in Torrance, California for the past five years. 

Action items as a result of the meeting include executing the CAs, providing Phillips with a detailed plot plan, product samples and completing a Phillips questionnaire. Once Phillips has evaluated the questionnaire data and the possible land area constraints at Morgan's Pt. we plan to have another meeting to decide how to move forward and in Phillips words ""move quickly."" 

From EGM's perspective the biggest issues appear to be:
1) Is conversion to alkylate the best conversion option for Enron? Are we better off waiting for California and the federal government to make up their minds on MTBE's future and what if any grant money they are willing to provide for MTBE plant conversions? 
2) If aklylate is the best product to convert to then is Phillips (as a partner) and their HF technology the best choice? Assuming they can get permitted at Morgan's Pt. or another ship channel site, what would be the best JV structure so EGM is not totally exposed to alkylate price risk or alkylate demand risk. 

On the positive side, Phillips believes in their technology, they think they can get permitted, they want to move quickly, they have good access to capital, space permitting they like our site, they are convinced that there will be good long term demand for alkylate within their own refining system (and in the refining industry in general) and they believe that the need for vapor pressure in the future will allow alkylate market prices to justify the necessary capital costs.

"AGA & API","Jeff -- 

Following up from the morning crude meeting, here's a story about the API possibly taking over the AGA weekly natgas stats.  Also, I have met John Felmy and I'd be happy to introduce someone at Enron to him.  If there's any preparatory work that needs to be done, I'll be in Washington on Monday.

13:43 25Oct2001 RSF-PLATT'S: AGA, API meet on gas storage data report: official

Washington (Platts)--25Oct2001/243 pm EDT/1843 GMT

Officials with the American Gas Association and the American
Petroleum Institute have met to discuss the possibility of the
oil association taking over the weekly natural gas storage
report, which AGA said it will discontinue at year end, API
chief economist John Felmy said Thursday. 

Felmy, who is charged with managing API's weekly report on oil and 
product data, said API has made no decision on whether to take over the report, and
has set no time frame to make such a decision. 

""Basically we are chewing things over,"" he said. ""We haven't even made an analysis
yet."" 

AGA and API discussed many aspects of the report,
including issues of profits and loss and information security,
Felmy said. AGA Oct 12 said it would stop providing the report
because it was taking too much time away from other programs.

Felmy said there are many similarities between the API and AGA
reports, but he noted that API's principle membership was not
the group that provides gas storage data to AGA. In addition,
AGA currently is the only provider of real-time storage
information. In the oil industry, both API and the Department of
Energy's Energy Information Administration provide weekly
statistics. EIA, which currently provides monthly gas storage
statistics, has said it would need additional funding to take
over the report, and even then did not expect to be able to
provide weekly data until 2004. Felmy said that as an economist
""I'd hate to see one of the data series disappear,"" and noted
that ""the AGA report is important to our members,"" particularly
those involved with heating oil.

"petrobras update","just talked to marcello castilho, the head of petrobras office in london.  he gave me the following:
their crude production is down by 900mbd.  they have crude and product stocks for the next 5 days, but then will need to buy. initially the thought wud b to buy crude however, the situation may have worsened at the refineries.
he was pessimistic about the discussions. said that petrobras called them to a meeting ydy as everyone knows and only upped the ante by 1pct on their side vs the 8.5 sought plus the inflation catch-up of 42pct. this really angered the unions and they have now said they will not come back to the table before seeing the numbers next time.  he said petrobras is up against internal competition now from other oil and gas companies who are offering ex petrobras workers a 15pct increase over their current pay, so petrobras is in a poor position.

so far the refs have been running at very low rates and the managers have not allowed the workers to leave the prmeises but have bunked them and fed them their in 12 hour shifts. by law they can only do this for 3 days and some fighting has already broken out at one location, so doubtful they can continue the 'imprisonment' much longer.

if it comes to a bigger showdown he thinks the unions will just shut the refs down on the last shift that they work, and he will be buying product not crude.

   Hi Jeff.  Thanks to Jenne for the introduction. Bob Verratti tells me
   that
   we are confirmed for a call and web-ex demo at 1:30 Pacific tomorrow,
   Wednesday, November 14. I will call you at (713) 853-1761 and the demo
   will
   be directed to your email address. We have had extensive discussions
   about
   the Opt4 platform with Greg Whalley, Greg Piper, Jay Webb and a number
   of
   others at Enron and I look forward to having the opportunity to
   demonstrate
   it for you.  Although the Opt4 platform can be used for many purposes,
   its
   unique application is in the trading of customized (OTC style)
   derivatives
   for any underlying market. The platform itself  allows an infinite
   amount of
   deal customization which we have chosen to constrain through the use of
   ""smart templates"" each of which reflects a structure recognized and
   traded
   on the OTC.  Traders then specify all terms within the template and post
   bids, offers or RFQ's to the site. All activity on the site (both
   postings
   and trade match) are constrained by our ""pre-permissioning"" system which
   checks in real time the trade specific and portfolio VaR to assure head
   room
   limits would not be exceeded.   We have spent a year building out with
   BOTCC
   the first ever clearing interface capable of handling this level of
   trade
   customization.  All standard clearance and settlement services are
   available
   through our  strategic partnership with BOTCC.  The end result is a
   fully
   integrated solution bringing transparency and credit support to OTC
   markets,
   whether in emerging markets such as chemicals, weather, or steel, or in
   established commodity and financial markets.  Our target customers fall
   into
   three categories:  1) established exchanges wanting to expand into
   customized trades linked to their existing product lines, 2) dealers or
   market makers seeking to automate and expand their phone business, 3)
   B2B's
   wanting to offer risk management products to support their cash market
   trading. The attached documents are quite high level but may help to get
   you
   oriented before our call tomorrow. They include a brief description of
   the
   Company, product summary,  a synopsis of platform functionality and
   hosting
   services and a white paper on our proprietary permssioning and risk
   management systems. I'll look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.

"1st weather deal","Fred- Robyn structured and executed our first power deal with AIG's Arbitrage Fund yesterday- DKR.

Its our first deal.. we made money and it fit directionally into Steve Vu's book.

We have been pitching the weather product since the beginning of the year but have been limited by the size of transactions we could do and the funds understanding of the market.  Most of the funds want to use weather as a hedge for an underlying position in gas or power.. and the size of the market in weather has not been enough to cover directional NYMEX views.

So we started to look at smaller deals in the market areas to hedge regional power and gas underlyings that will naturally be smaller positions.

DEAL we did: Basket of 5 cities... equally weighted


DKR sold Nov HDD swap of basket of 5 cities: chicago, clevland, LGA, DC, Boston - equally weighted average of the 5 cities
strike = 650
payout= 2,000/HDD  with 400,000 cap.

DKR benefits if it is warm.

"RE: Fantastic Friday/Super Saturday Interviewers","Mike & Jeff - 

I've been charged to rally some EGM support for the upcoming AA recruiting events.  As of today, EGM does not have any representation at the events outlined below.  Since interviewing is the key component of the events, I would like to concentrate on finding 10 EGM interviewers for 10/26 and 10 to 15 EGM interviewers for the remaining dates.  Interviewers need only to be managers or above.  Please let me know if you already have interviewers identified and/or what I can do to help generate EGM participation.    

Thanks for your help - Tana Cashion

Subject:	Fantastic Friday/Super Saturday Interviewers

As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.  One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.  It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.  Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:

		Dates						Total Number of Interviewers Needed**

October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview        
November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview		
November 15-16        Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview
November 30-Dec 1   Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview

I have attached a list of those individuals in various business units that have participated in the interview process in the past for your review (as a sample of the type of individual we are looking for as interviewers).  Please provide me a list of your business unit's interviewers by date by Friday, October 5.  Individuals are encouraged to interview more than one selected date and we will forward details to them at least a week prior to the interview date.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks again for all your help.  Ted and Traci

 << File: List of Interviewers.xls >> 
**  We do not expect you to provide all the interviewers.  This number reflects to total needed from all business units and will include those needed for both the evening and interview days..

"CAM Corporate Committee, action required by October 31","
To all Corporate Committee Members:
As a Committee Member, you are asked to thumb through your rolodex and find those contacts that would be most interested in supporting the Contemporary Arts Museum.  This year, we would like to start the thinking process before the November 1st meeting to avoid leaving out any potential targets.  Therefore, we are asking that each of you identify three to five possible companies with your contact names and fax or email them to Amber Winsor at awinsor@camh.org or 713-284-8275 by 5:00 p.m. Tuesday, October 30, 2001.   We will approach these companies to join as a corporate member at the $1000, $2500, $5000 or $10,000 levels. You can decide which level to ask for and you will be a signature on the request letter.  At the meeting, we will identify co-signers to help improve the chances for a successful response from these prospects.
FYI - for those of you who cannot attend the November 1st  meeting, this step is even more important.  It will bring your voice and ideas to the meeting if you can't be there in person.
Thank you.

Subject:	RE: Project OZ update

Here's an update:

- We received detailed comments back from them on Monday, as reqd.
- We discussed these w/them, our legal and Morgan on Tues to clarify some items.
- Called them today to officially kill based mainly on the fact that in their response they had pulled the gathering system out of the collateral pool and proposed putting the gathered crude to the refinery at market rather than cost. This is a reduction of $5MM/yr in earnings and $10-15MM in collateral.
- After quite a bit of discussion today, it's clear they still want to get the deal done and are willing to revert back to having the gathered crude in at cost and as part of the collateral. The major issue is trying to find a structure in which they have some upside in the transaction beyond just the locked 1.4 coverage.

So...I said that if we get something in writing that puts gathering back in and satisfies our other reqmts, we will then try to revise the structure to give them a little more upside. Norman is traveling tomorrow and will get us something on Monday.

Below is a summary of my discussion w/ Norman Abood (General Counsel for GAF) in response to our termination letter dated 10/16/01 and his written response on 10/17.  Basically, I told Norman it was time to stop the paper trail and either get down to closing or go our separate ways.  I emphasized our primary concerns as follows:
  
	1.  GAF's ability to fund its equity
	2.  finalizing the feedstock supply and products off-take
	3.  Morgan's commitment to finance the debt 
	4.  defining the pool of assets to be collateralized
	5.  evidence of insurability, and 
	6.  restructuring of GAF's PSA w/ Farmland.

I also emphasized our frustration over the ""continually moving targets"" (debt, collateral, equity, feedstocks, etc...) and told him I will NOT continue to expend resources and time playing games.  Finally, I told him I was willing to re-engage on the following terms:

	a.  GAF submit either a written set of comments to our 9/21 MOU or a counter-proposal to us by Monday, 10/22.
	b.  If, subject to OUR review and based on US believing there's merit to proceed that we get ALL PARTIES (GAF, 	     Morgan Stanley and EGM) together and hammer out a definitive and final version of the MOU including, but not 		     limited to the primary concerns above (w/ all parties having ""subject to senior management and/or Board approval"" 	     language/conditions).  The purpose here is to get all the T&C down in writing with everyone in the room in 	     conceptual agreement which will make it more difficult for the targets to move.
	c.  Morgan Stanley must be willing to sign some form of commitment letter evidencing their willingness to finance the 	     transaction.

GAF will then have some finite/specific period of time in which to approach Farmland and restructure their deal as necessary to close the transaction.

Norman agreed in principle and committed to get back to us by tomorrow.  Hopefully, this will once and for all define whether or not this deal can get done.

USA: Enron shares in stay in doldrums after downgrade.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s share price hovered above seven-year lows touched in earlier trade Monday after Moody's Investor Service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of North America's largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status. 
Enron, the largest electricity and natural gas trader in North America, also on Monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks.
Enron shares were down $1.40, or 9.03 percent, to $14.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier in the session trading below $14 for the first time since December 1994. 
Moody's also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded to Baa2, as well as its rating for the Enron's commercial paper. 
Enron's credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day trading operations and its trading partners' perception of making good on trades. With a credit rating hovering above junk status, the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. 
Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

USA: US companies' credit quality to worsen-Moody's.
By Jonathan Stempel

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better, a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on Monday. 
Moody's Investors Service said that in the third quarter, it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 U.S. companies. At the same time, it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies.
That 5.5-to-1 ratio is far greater than the 1.3-to-1 ratio in the second quarter. 
In dollar terms, the situation looks more dire. Moody's warned it may downgrade $543 billion of debt, dwarfing the $66 billion Moody's said it may upgrade by 8.2-to-1. 
""Particularly in light of September 11, the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. ""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year."" 
Rating reviews are significant because, unlike actual rating changes, they are not a ""lagging"" indicator, and suggest the future direction of corporate credit. Moody's normally wraps up its reviews within three months. 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. These include the weakening U.S. economy, an inability of marginal companies to raise cash, debt-financed merger activity and fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance, and travel. 
For example, Moody's in July warned it may cut Comcast Corp.'s ratings after the Philadelphia-based company bid $44.5 billion for AT&T Corp.'s cable TV operations. 
Then last month, Moody's warned it may cut Chicago-based Boeing Co.'s ratings because of the attacks' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes. 
In the third quarter, Moody's warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative-grade, or ""junk""-rated, companies, and raise the ratings of just 11. For investment-grade companies, the gap was even more yawning: 68-to-11. 
And in the fourth quarter? Through Friday, Moody's warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four. On Monday, it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp., and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade. 
Puchalla, however, said the decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues,"" he said. ""That is a positive for credit quality."" 
The third quarter was the 14th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades. The record is 19 quarters, set between 1988 and 1993.

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

     (Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.30, or 8.4 percent, to
$14.10 in midday trading. Earlier, they touched $13.55, down 12
percent. The company's credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors
Service after it wrote down the value of its assets.

     The stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months.

USA: Enron shares drop despite further triage attempts.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron shares slipped to a new six-year low in early trade as North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader said it was talking to banks about tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron's shares were trading down 90 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $14.60 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares crashed through $15, a low not seen since February 1995.
Last week, Enron shed almost $14 billion in market value as its stock price tumbled more than half since last week, when a series of piecemeal disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
However, many industry observers see Enron's request for an additional credit after tapping its banks for $3.3 billion last week after as a sign a weakness not of strength. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carole Levenson, research analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a move to shore up investor confidence. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on a new credit line.
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
Enron shares sank 50 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $15 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. ((David Howard Sinkman, New York Newsdesk 646-223-6094)).

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron says in talks with banks for new credit line.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a new move to shore up investor confidence after it tapped about $3 billion in credit last week, and to stop a plunge in the company's stock that set new six-year lows. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line.
Enron shares crashed through a psychological barrier of $15 a share, shedding $1.66, or 10.65 percent, to $13.85 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost more than half of its value in the past two weeks, losing more than $14 billion in market capitalization. 
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston. 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
""Clearly, both the stock and bond market view Enron as being in dire straits,"" said independent research firm Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead it's an act of desperation.""

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- On the face of things, it's hard to understand the stock market's headspinning reaction to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks.
Why the talk of a ""death spiral"" for North America's premier energy trading company? The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), for example, saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12-month period. Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco. 
The difference is that over the past few years, Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question. 
If you're buying network components, you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier. After all, you're buying something you can touch. But if you're buying power or gas, what you're really buying is a commitment to deliver. If your supplier doesn't come through when the market gets tough, you're left totally exposed. In Enron's energy trading business, then, credibility at every level is critical. 
For now, Enron looks to be more than viable. But the company's asset-light strategy might not be. Gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1.65% in the third quarter from 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, asset-heavy energy companies like Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure. 
Two weeks ago, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. That didn't send investors running, however. In fact, its stock price rose a bit on the news. 
What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets, or ""shareholders' equity,"" by $1.2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. That, along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission produced a $15.6 billion drop in Enron's market value. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enron's senior, unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, leaving it two steps above junk-bond levels. The agency kept Enron's ratings on watch for further downgrade. 
Long-Running Concerns 

A 50% hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a 10% reduction in shareholders' equity. The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enron's loss of credibility. Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them, but few on the call believed that. 
For some analysts, Enron's revelations only fed long-running concerns about the company's lack of financial disclosure. 
Cary Wasden, managing partner of Reed Wasden Research, has had a ""sell"" recommendation on Enron since March. Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms, Wasden isn't in the business of selling stock. His firm isn't involved in brokerage and isn't a hedge fund. Wasden gets paid for his research, and the company doesn't invest in the securities it covers. 
A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from one-time sale of physical assets in operating income. His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years - a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldn't immediately respond. 
""Don't believe by any means this is the end of the story,"" Wasden said. 
Wall Street sell-side analysts have largely kept Enron as a ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" as the stock fell from $90 to $20. But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enron's reporting. 
For now, the plunge in the price of Enron's shares and bonds, which last week started trading like junk-rated debt, hasn't hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners. 
""We haven't changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices. We're watching it, and so is everybody else, but they are a solid company,"" Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction. ""This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that I'm sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point."" 
Keeping Talent A Challenge 

Enron is a big company - far too big to ignore. But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders' transactions with Enron. If the company's investment-grade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed, risk managers won't be able to ignore it, whatever else Moody's does. 
Assuming that doesn't happen, Enron still faces a tough road ahead. Like all companies, Enron is the combination of capital and talent. For financial companies, talent is the more important ingredient, and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time. 
New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August, and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year. The losses can be expected to continue. Much of the top management cashed out when the company's stock price was high and moved on. Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on, if they haven't already. 
Over the years, Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry. Those options are now nearly worthless. If Enron's debt-service costs rise, the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America. 
Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top. When Skilling left, nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lay's assurances that it was for ""personal reasons."" When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week, Lay said, ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO."" 
That's putting words in Wall Street analysts' mouths. Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer? 
""I don't know anybody who said that,"" Wasden said. ""What did the CFO do, what did Skilling do, that Ken Lay wasn't part of?"" 
Real change will have to come from without, Wasden said. 
""Enron has been a cult, more than a company,"" he said. ""Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company, it just changes the disciples. Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside."" 
Nevertheless, Wasden thinks Enron's stock has reached its natural floor and, if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money, it can recover over time. 
""There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets, like pipelines and power plants,"" he said. 
That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating. Given the bind Enron is in, Lay won't have much choice. Enron will survive, but it won't be the same company at all.

OFFICIAL CORRECTION Enron long-term ratings downgraded to Baa2 - Moody's

10/29/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

(Moody's corrected its stance on Enron ratings to a downgrade) 
NEW YORK (AFX) - Moody's Investors Service said it has lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Enron Corp from Baa1 to Baa2 following a deterioration in Enron's financial flexibility since the company announced significant writedowns as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments.
The long-term debt ratings remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said. 
Moody's also placed the company's Prime-2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade. 
Moody's initially placed Enron's long-term debt ratings on review on Oct 16. The write-downs and equity charges led to a substantial loss in investor confidence that has led to a more than halving of Enron's share price and difficulties in rolling over commercial paper, according to Moody's. 
In response to these events, Moody's said Enron has shored up its near-term liquidity position by drawing down on all of its committed revolving credit facilities and buying back its outstanding commercial paper, leaving the company with a net cash position of approximately 1.2 bln usd. 
Moody's said it plans to focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties.

USA: Moody's cuts Enron to 2 notches above ""junk"".

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp.'s senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status, and warned it may cut that rating again, as well as its rating for Enron's commercial paper. 
The rating agency cut Houston-based Enron's senior unsecured debt to ""Baa2"" from ""Baa1,"" and said it may cut Enron's ""Prime-2"" commercial paper rating, which affects short-term debt. Its rating actions affect $13 billion.
Moody's said Enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write-downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments this month. This triggered ""difficulties in rolling over commercial paper,"" Moody's said. 
Enron, which has about $63.4 billion in energy assets, said on Monday it is talking with banks to get more credit, after last week drawing down $3 billion from a bank credit line to buy back its outstanding commercial paper. 
Its shares traded Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.75, down $1.75, or 11.3 percent. They have fallen 62 percent since Oct. 12, from $35.81. 
Rating agency, Standard & Poor's, on Thursday revised its outlook for Enron's ratings to ""negative"" from ""stable.""

UK: Europe energy firms wary of Enron on credit worries.
By Stuart Penson

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy companies in Europe are shying away from trading with troubled U.S. energy group Enron amid concerns about the company's credit status, industry sources said on Monday. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron - one of Europe's biggest gas and power traders - as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements, the sources said.
""I think Enron's approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow,"" said the head of risk management at one UK utility that halted its trade with Enron last week. 
""They are talking with us about bank letters of credit,"" he said. ""The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis."" 
A spokesman for Enron's European headquarters in London headquarters declined to comment. 
Reluctance to trade with Enron in Europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five-year lows. 
Triggering the slide was news last week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer. 
Houston-based Enron trades a large amount of its volume in the U.S. and Europe through its Internet EnronOnline system. 
Last Friday the company said trade on EnronOnline was above average levels with more than 8,400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $4 billion. 
Traders said Enron's plight could hit liquidity in European gas and power markets, where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years. 
One industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the UK electricity market had put on hold their trading Enron, which is among the biggest five traders in the market. 
In mainland Europe, where Enron has been a major driver of liquidity, potential counterparties are treading with care. 
""We are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a 'sleeve' (a third party trader),"" said a senior trader at one of Germany's big utilities, who declined to be named. 
French traders said wariness about dealing with Enron had dampened liquidity although Enron was still in the market on Monday morning. 
""Enron is a major player so counter parties are looking to see if there is a problem,"" said one French trader.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Puts Spotlight Back On Broadband
By Michael Rieke

10/29/2001

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Thanks to Enron Corp. (ENE), the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money.
But it won't be traders who will cash in on this new potential. It will be class-action attorneys. They're already lining up to sue Enron in at least five shareholder suits. 
As of Oct. 25, two of lawsuits had been filed against Enron in federal court and three more in Texas state court. Most of them name as defendants Ken Lay, Enron's longtime chairman, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence Oct. 25. 
Still another suit, which isn't a class action suit, was filed naming as defendants members of Enron's board of directors. 
All the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships Enron set up, many of them managed by Fastow. Most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the Fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with Enron. 
The transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband, water and other Enron investments. 
Fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions. As Enron's chief financial officer, he was being paid to manage the corporation's finances. As general partner of two LJM partnerships, he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with Enron. He shared in profits of those partnerships. 
When investors began demanding information about the transactions, Enron's share price began to slide. With the heat on, Enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals, among other things. 
That's when the class action attorneys went to work. So far, at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs. Enron didn't respond to calls asking about the lawsuits. 
Among the law firms representing plaintiffs is Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit. The release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $30 billion from class action lawsuits. 
The lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market. Some of the deals with the LJM partnerships run by Fastow ""purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market,"" according to Abrams and Franks v. Enron et al. 
That could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months. Market skeptics have said Enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth. 
Enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties, a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year, according to Enron. 
Now market watchers will want to know if any of Enron's trades were done with the LJM partnerships managed by Fastow. 
They will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with Chewco Investments. That Houston company, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, was managed by Michael Kopper and was set up in 1997 when Kopper was a managing director with Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. He left Enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by Fastow. 
Do the plaintiffs' attorneys know whether Enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships? 
""I think if is too early to tell,"" Thomas Bilek of Hoeffner & Bilek told Bandwidth Beat. ""As you know, (information) is coming out in drabs and dribbles from Enron."" 
It could be several months before plaintiffs' attorneys get a chance to ask Enron officials those questions, Bilek said. 
It's also too early to tell what potential damages plaintiffs could win, said Steven Schulman, an attorney with Milberg Weiss. ""At this point, you can only talk about it in terms of (shareholder) losses, and the losses are in the billions."" 
Total losses will depend on the price each shareholder plaintiff paid for the stock and the price at which each shareholder later sold the stock. 
Enron's share price topped out between $90 and $91 in the summer of last year. It set a 52-week low Oct. 26 at $15.04. That spread leaves plenty of room for losses. 
Schulman told Bandwidth Beat that the record for losses in shareholder cases is $11 billion in a case involving Cendant Corp. (CD). Damages are usually a substantial portion of losses, Schulman said. 
""Whether (the Enron case) is bigger or less, I couldn't opine,"" he said. ""This is a big case, by any means.""

"RE:","Hi Jennifer,

There was some discussion of this, but I haven't agreed to pay for the damage, as it was caused by a 3rd party contractor. When I was at the house I mentioned the damage to company that's responsible, and told them that we'd follow up for reparations.

If you'll forward the invoice (a copy will be fine) I'll try and run this down and see that it's taken care of. 

Please send via interoffice -- I'm at EB2241

Paige,

Some time ago Jeff had some wiring done at his home for use of his company laptop.  As you may recall there were some problems where the wiring was placed the first time and Jeff had to have his contractor come out and do repairs.  We had discussed your group reimbursing or paying for the repairs and the invoice has made it to my desk today.  Please let me know how you would like to proceed with this.

Thanks,
Jennifer
