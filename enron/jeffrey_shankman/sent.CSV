Jeff,

Hi there......sounds like Penny has been equally emphatic on both sides
about meeting...

So sorry not to have responded earlier ...it has been such a completely
psychotic week for me. I have been in London and Stockholm this week - I
don't think I slept more than 3 hours a night all week. I am on my way
tomorrow to India (Bombay and Bangalore)...London on Thursday...and back to
New York on Thursday night or Friday morning. Friday and Saturday (April 13
& 14) are fairly free for me - would Friday night work for you?

It will be difficult for me to reach you from India- given schedule and time
difference, but I will be accessing email. I can be reached on a mobile
number in Europe on today and on Thursday - ++44 7990 973 620. As of Friday
- in New York, the best place to reach me is on - 1 917 862 6552. By the
way, how is the Peninsula post-renovations? I liked it before the
renovations - am sure its even more wonderful.

Hi Elizabeth,

I'm Penny and Sam Britell's friend (Sam's from college) who have
mentioned (truthfully, insisted) that we should get together for a drink
next time I'm in NYC.
I'll be in new york sunday the 7th through the 14th and would love to
get together for that drink Penny and Sam keep telling me about.
Fortunately I have a pretty open schedule next week, so if you have any
time, I'd like to meet you.

I'll be staying at the Penninsula next week, or feel free to call me on
my cell phone at 713 854 4952.  As well, I'll be checking voicemail in
the office (713) 853 1761.

I'll be out of the office the next two days, but leave a message if you
have time.

Regards,

Jeff

Joe,
 
I enjoyed our conversation yesterday and look forward to learning more.  Now it seems more challenging than ever to pick a spot within Enron, but I have had good conversations with several groups and it does look like some good opportunities do still exist around the organization including your shop.  As you look over my CV you will I'm sure notice that my educational background is different than the typical Enron recruit.  I think that my performance during my years within Enron and the consistent recognition I have received in PRC in some of the core operations of Enron's business should demonstrate that at this point differences in education are insignificant relative to my potential to positively contribute to the business.  I look forward to talking again soon.

Regards,
Fred

How are things in Houston?  Sorry it's taken us so long to write.  No
excuses, just forgot actually.

Last night however, we heard about an art exhibit that will be here in
October called SOFA.  We were wondering if you were planning to come up for
that and thought we should shoot you an e-mail and find out.   Even if you
don't plan to come for that, we'd still love for you to come up and visit.
We have a few friends we'd like to introduce you to (no, Alyson has not
forgotten about your BMW offer).

Talk with you soon!

Dear Jeff-
I have been in Atlanta for two weeks and am continuing to unpack and
assemble furniture. I thought of you last night as I came across the
wonderful surrealism book that you gave me; what a great book. Of
course, I had to stop my unpacking to read through parts of it. I did
not get much unapcking done, but I had fun.
I reconnected with Christina Johns, one of my roomates at Penn with
Dori and she passed along Dori's email address. I sent her an email
and she responded, and appears to be happy in Philly with her 18
month old daughter. I told her that we had seen each other in NYC
during the past years and gave her an update on your successes and
accomplishments.
I hope that work is going well. I have to return to an orientation
session. My new phone number (404)248-2290 and address 757 Houston
Mill Rd. NE, Apt. 8 Atlanta, GA. 30329-4240. Does Enron have an
office in Atlanta?

Mr. Shankman:

My name is Robert Brown and I am a fellow alumnus of the Wharton School.  I
noticed that you provided your name on the Penn Career Network as a mentor
for other alumni.  I have just returned from a sabbatical and am currently
seeking to enter the energy industry in Houston now that I have returned
stateside.  As a person who has achieved a prominent position in the
industry in which I am interested, I thought you might be able to help me in
my endeavors with some advice.

Would it be possible for me to contact you at a convenient time, so that I
might be able to ask you a few questions?  Please feel free to call me on my
cell phone at 832.541.5805 or you can also reach me through e-mail by
responding to this e-mail.  Thank you for making yourself available to other
alumni like myself.  I look forward to speaking to you.

Regards,

Robert L. Brown

David,

I run a $650 million dollar commodities fund at Harvard Management Company.
Our focus has been on arbitrage strategies in the commodity arena - we are
looking to expand into weather and power. I was wondering, if given the
potential situation at Enron, that there might be employees interested in
interviewing for several positions both within my group and foreign equities
? I apologize if this is too forward or that I have assumed too much in
terms of potential restructurings.

Thanks,

Dear Jeff,

We just received the new Kondo piece - and quite honestly, I think it is
even better than the one you saw at the gallery.  I am attaching two images
- the first of just the plaque, and the second with the frame.  The
gestures in this piece are more interesting than the first and the plaque
is about 1 inch larger (height and width).

Please know that our photography doesn't do this piece justice - it is
beautiful and the color is much more vibrant than it appears.

Please let me know your thoughts.  As is gallery policy, all offerings are
subject to prior sale.

Best,
Carole Hochman

Jeff, 

Just got off the phone with Greg Curran.  Guess he's been talking to you about the fact that I'm moving off the bandwidth trading desk here in London and have been exploring opportunities in different groups.  

Was telling Michelle Nezi Marvin last week about my situation.  Coincidentally, she offered to introduce me to you for some good advice as to what I should do.  I was one year behind her at Wharton and look forward to seeing her in Philadelphia next week for on-campus interviews.

I'm actually enjoying London quite a lot, and so am hoping to stay here for the time being.  But Greg suggested I send you a copy of my CV as you might be have some good ideas for me.

Thanks.... and look forward to speaking with you, 

Betsy
