"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

For what avail the plough or sail, Or land or life, if freedom

-----------------------------------------------------------------
TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

MICRON'S MISERABLE QUARTER
Micron Technology (NYSE: MU), one of the world's top producers
of memory chips, probably wishes it could forget the past
several months. After the bell yesterday, the company reported a
fourth-quarter loss of $576 million, or $0.96 a share. Revenue
plummeted 79% year-over-year to $480 million. Full-year numbers
for fiscal 2001 show a loss of $0.88 a share on revenue of $3.9
billion.

>>FULL STORY:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=503822

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Second-quarter earnings were a bit bubblier for Bed Bath &
Beyond (Nasdaq: BBBY). Not only did the home products retailer
increase revenue by 21% from the same period last year, it also
saw same-store sales rise by 4.8% and maintained its earlier
guidance for the second half of the year.

There's nothing fowl about Tyson Foods' (NYSE: TSN) fourth
quarter. The king o' chicken raised its estimates for the
quarter to $0.18 to $0.22 a share, which is significantly higher
than its previous guidance of $0.08 to $0.12.

AES Corporation (NYSE: AES), one of the world's top power
producers, powered down its full-year earnings estimates in a
big way. Blaming a weakening Brazilian Real, a decline in
electricity prices in England, and the economy, the
Virginia-based company now expects to earn $1.25-$1.45 per share
for all of 2001. That's some 20%-30% below estimates.

Textron (NYSE: TXT) this morning reduced its outlook for the
second half of the year and said it would have to cut 2,500 more
jobs and take large restructuring charges. The maker of Bell
helicopters, Cessna planes, and industrial products blamed the
softening economy and the September 11 tragedy for many of its
woes.

Expect Vans (Nasdaq: VANS) to pull to the side of the road for
the next quarter. Although the ""extreme sports"" apparel retailer
reported record first-quarter sales and earnings after the bell
yesterday, it said its second quarter would fall short of
expectations. CEO Gary Schoenfeld blamed a sharp slowdown caused
by the September 11 terrorist attacks.

And on this day in 1774, Jonathan Chapman was born in
Leominister, Massachusetts. This apple farmer pioneered the
Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) method of giving away the product in
order to gain marketshare. Chapman was better known as Johnny Appleseed.

TRUST
""...I bumped into an old friend so often ignored in business --
Trust. The value -- the real, economic value -- of trust is almost always
understated. I value it above all else when making long-term
economic commitments to businesses whose economics and
competitive advantages I am otherwise totally comfortable with.""

"NYISO - Generation in Response to Price Signals","
FCiani@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants,

One of the Generation Issues objectives deployed in September was to allow
off-dispatch units to move in response to price signals.  A settlement
feature of this change was that off-dispatch units would not receive bid
production cost guarantees for incremental energy.  These units would only
be guaranteed cost recovery for minimum generation and start-up costs.

The function to limit this cost recovery was incorrectly designed, with the
result that the cost recovery was not limited to the bid minimum generation
cost.  The cost recovery was incorrectly calculated as the bid minimum
generation MW  times the bid minimum generation cost.

This error has been corrected and will be reflected in the next execution
of the September settlement statements, which will correct the values
before the September invoicing period.

If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

      meeting


Responding to Tim Lynch's comments:

The BME-SCD Operating Reserve Comparison includes the following note:
""Data for BME hours beginning 0:00 was not reliable, assumed all hours were
not short.""

Please explain why data for this hour each day is unreliable and how it
impacts customer bills.  We are troubled that after operating a system for
nearly two years, problems remain that cause this magnitude of inaccuracy.

Tim Lynch
NYSEG Energy Trading
********************

As was explained at the PITF meeting the footnote in question related to a
data transferral problem between the NYISO and LECG that had NO IMPACT on
the BME prices, schedules or any billing matters.

To collate the data for the PITF meeting in a meaningful way it was
necessary to track the state of the 30 minute reserve constraint i.e. was
BME able to purchase sufficient 30 minute reserves to meet the pool 30
minute reserve requirement. LECG's information for the status of the 30
minute reserve constraint for hour beginning 0:00 was unreliable because of
data tranferral and processing problems so we made the very reasonable
assumption that in the middle of the night there is little chance that we
were reserve short. The footnote was entirely reasonable given the context
of the discussion for which the data was prepared.

Thank-you

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

RELIANT RESOURCES BUYING ORION POWER
Reliant Resources (NYSE: RRI) announced this morning plans to
acquire Orion Power Holdings (NYSE: ORN) for $4.7 billion in
cash and debt. For Reliant, the deal provides an opportunity to
expand its portfolio of electricity-generating plants in robust
deregulated markets, where government disruption is unlikely in
the coming months.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Network equipment maker Sonus Networks (Nasdaq: SONS) got
hammered in after-hours trading after announcing that it expects
a third-quarter pro forma net loss of $0.05 to $0.07 per share
on sales of $40 million. That's well below Wall Street's
expectations for sales and earnings of $54.4 million and $0.01
per share, respectively. Sonus will also take charges up to $466
million.

Allegiance Telecom (Nasdaq: ALGX), a competitive local-exchange
carrier, reported disappointing third-quarter results yesterday,
citing the short-term impact of the terrorist attacks on Sept.
11. The company expects revenue of $135 million, well below Wall
Street's expectation of $147.2 million. Allegiance also lowered
its 2001 revenue target 5% below its previous expectation of
$550 million, but maintained full-year earnings guidance.

Guitar Center (Nasdaq: GTRC) was playing the warning blues
yesterday when the music retailer announced that its
third-quarter sales and earnings would fall short of Wall
Street's expectations. Guitar Center expects sales between $219
million and $222 million, with earnings of $0.04 to $0.06 per
share, versus Wall Street's current expectation of $0.16 per
share. The company attributed its disappointing results to the
terrorist attacks, which hurt sales.

Enterasys Networks (NYSE: ETS), which makes network equipment
such as routers and switches, reported second-quarter pro forma
earnings of $23.1 million, or $0.11 per share, compared with
earnings of $10.2 million, or $0.05 per share, in the year-ago
quarter. Wall Street's consensus expectation called for earnings
of $0.10 per share. Revenue increased roughly 26% to $240
million compared to $190.7 million in the same period last year.

ADVENTURES WITH A MERCEDES 240D
""One thing about the Mercedes is that feeling of elegance. Just
riding around behind that hood ornament is a big boost for one's
ego. It gives me delusions of adequacy...But there is a price
for the elegance, reliability, and convenience.""

"Virtual Bidding - data release","Dear Market Participants:

Methodology used in developing the NYISO Virtual Bidding Credit
Requirements:

Day Ahead Market Hourly Zonal LBMP and Real Time Market Integrated Hourly
Zonal LBMP values were used as the data source for developing the NYISO
Virtual Bidding Credit Requirements.  These values are available on the
NYISO web site.  The time period of June 1, 2001 through August 31, 2001
was used.  Peak hours are defined here as the hours of 6am (06:00) through
and including 10pm (22:00).  The absolute value of the difference of the
DAM and R/T price was calculated for each peak hour.  The 97th percentile
of these series of prices was calculated for each zone.  The maximum of
these zonal 97th percentiles was calculated to be $159.33.  The data
manipulation and calculation was performed in MS Excel. The attached
spreadsheet contains the data used in the June 2001 to August 2001
calculations.

"FW: Third Quarter EPS Increase 38%; Maintaining 2001E and 2002E	 EPS","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	""Russo, Brian"" <Brian.Russo@ubsw.com>@ENRON   On Behalf Of ""Abramson, Barry"" <Barry.Abramson@ubsw.com>
Sent:	Thursday, October 25, 2001 4:50 PM
To:	undisclosed-recipients:;@ENRON
Subject:	CIN:  Third Quarter EPS Increase 38%; Maintaining 2001E and 2002E	 EPS

KEY POINTS
*	CIN reported third quarter 2001 operating earnings of $0.80 per share, compared with $0.58 per share earned in
the third quarter of 2000.  The 38% increase in earnings per share is primarily due to strength in wholesale trading and
marketing and solid growth at the regulated utility operations.
*	Cinergy reaffirmed its 2001 earnings guidance of $2.75 per share.  Although no comments regarding 2002 estimated
earnings were provided by the company, we currently feel comfortable with our 2002E EPS of $2.95.  We expect Cinergy to
grow earnings at a conservative rate of 7%-8% per annum, with regulated operations growing at 5%-6% and energy merchant
operations growing at 10%-12%.  However, if the economy weakens further and wholesale power prices remain at current
levels we may revisit on 2002 estimated earnings per share at a later date.
*	Energy Merchant segment earnings were $0.37 per share, more than double the $0.15 per share earned in last
year's third quarter.  Origination, marketing and trading gross margins rose $43 million, or $0.07 per share, to $217.1
million from $174.1 million last year.  Electricity trading volumes totaled 86,398,499 mWh, up 150% from last year's
levels.  Physical and financial gas trading volumes totaled 48.1 bcf per day, up 160% over the same period last year.
Cinergy Solutions, the segment's cogeneration business, added $0.03 per share in the quarter.  Also, CIN added roughly
1,100 MW of new gas-fired peaking capacity since the third quarter last year.
*	Regulated Operations earned $0.48 per share in the latest quarter, compared with $0.46 per share in the third
quarter 2000.  Gross margins improved due to increased customer demand from service territory growth and warmer weather.
This was offset slightly by increased operations and maintenance and interest expenses.  Total electric retail sales
volumes were 13,898,726 mWh, up 3.6% over last year's level.  Gas retail and transportation sales volumes declined 10.8%
to 10,248,332 mcf.  The decrease was primarily related to weather as well as softening industrial demand.  As of
September 2001, total electric customers were 1,500,790, up from 1,481,411 a year ago and total gas customers were
489,667, up from 482,328 a year ago.
*	Results from the Power Technology and Infrastructure Services segment lost $0.05 per share, down from a loss of
$0.03 in the prior year.  Through Cinergy Ventures Group, this division pursues technology equity investments and runs
technology pilots.  CIN owns several start-up energy infrastructure companies that incurred additional costs as well as
roughly $100 million of direct and indirect investments in power technology-related companies that decreased in value
during the third quarter.
*	We continue to rate shares of CIN Strong Buy. Our 12-month price target of $37 per share is based upon a P/E
multiple of 12.5 times our 2002 EPS estimate of $2.95. In our opinion, the premium valuation is warranted. CIN is a low
cost producer of electricity (primarily coal) that is strategically located in the Midwest, and is actively adding to
its merchant generation portfolio. In total, Cinergy Corp. owns 13,000 MW of generation capacity. Of that total, 6,000
MW is regulated and 7,000 MW is unregulated. Because of Cinergy Corp.'s strategic location and its large fleet of
low-cost power plants, we think the company would be attractive to potential acquirers.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

=================================================================
YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

Q. WHY DO SOME REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (REITS) HAVE
TERRIFIC DIVIDEND YIELDS WHILE OTHERS DON'T? IS THERE ANY REASON
NOT TO INVEST IN HIGH-YIELD REITS?

A. If a yield looks too good to be true, it probably is.
Remember that it's the market that sets the price of the stock.
And as a stock's price drops, its yield rises.

For perspective, consider that a 30-year U.S. Treasury is priced
to yield around 6 percent, because investors are pretty sure the
dividend will be paid. But Russian government bond yields can hover
around 30 percent -- because investors are not so sure.

The same goes with REITs. As an example, consider Kranzco, the
highest yielding shopping center REIT with a yield of around 15
percent at the time of this writing (in 2000). Because of weak
earnings, it has been forced to cut its dividend. This
development caused many investors to sell, sending the stock
price south and the yield up. Management's dividend cut may be
enough, but investors are understandably nervous about what the
future holds.

If you invest in a REIT yielding 10 percent, things may well
turn out hunky-dory. But if you go for one kicking out 18
percent to 30 percent, you're buying into income streams that
other folks find pretty doubtful. You'll want to do enough
research to be pretty sure you're right.


Q. WHAT IS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU CAN INVEST? WHAT
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY 100 SHARES?

A. It's tragic that many people put off investing for years,
thinking they're not rich enough to benefit from the stock
market. You definitely don't need to have $1,000 or more before
you start investing. You don't have to buy 100 shares at a time.
You can buy 17 shares or nine shares -- or even fractions of
shares, using some services. For instance, at buyandhold.com,
you can invest as little as $20 at a time and buy fractional
shares of stock, paying $2.99 per trade.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
THIS WEEK'S LESSON

WARREN BUFFETT ON INVESTING
A great way to learn about investing is to glean insights from
experienced, successful investors. One of the savviest is Warren
Buffett. Here are some comments he made at his Berkshire Hathaway
shareholder meeting in 2000:

""The first investment primer was written by Aesop in 600 B.C. He
said, 'A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.' Aesop forgot to
include when you get the two in the bush and what interest rates are.
Investing is simply figuring out your cash outlay (the bird in
the hand) and comparing it to how many birds are in the bush and
when you get them.""

""It's no religious thing why we don't invest in technology. It's
just that we've never found a company where we think we know what
the bush will look like in 10 years and how many birds will be in it.
We understand technology and its impact on society. It's the
predictability of the economics of the situation 10 years out
that we don't understand. ... The only way we know how to make
money is to buy businesses we understand.""

""I own 100 shares of companies such as Microsoft and Intel, so I
get the annual reports. I don't think it's a dumb thing if you want
to learn about businesses to invest tiny amounts in various companies
-- especially for young people -- to get exposed to various managements,
to go to shareholder meetings, get reports, etc.""

""It pays to have the right role models/heroes. ... You'll want
to be a little or a lot more. I tell students to pick out the qualities
they admire in people they admire and ask why they can't develop
those qualities themselves. It's very simple. The person you'd
really like to admire is yourself.""

Berkshire's Vice Chairman Charlie Munger added, ""You can't avoid
making wrong decisions in life, but if you recognize them and do something
about them, you can wring some lemonade out of them. We've
scrambled our way out of many mistakes.""

For more Buffett wisdom, head to berkshirehathaway.com, where
there are several decades' worth of his extremely educational
letters to shareholders. Or visit our Berkshire Hathaway
discussion board online.

""Americans can not only make on-line donations, they can figure

President George W. Bush


-----------------------------------------------------------------
TOP STORY

BOEING TO CUT WORKFORCE
Boeing (NYSE: BA), the world's largest manufacturer of
commercial jet aircraft, announced late last night that it would
reduce employment by 20,000 to 30,000 by the end of 2002, 10% to
15% of its workforce.

>>FULL STORY:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=497747

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Congress and the Bush Administration continue discussions with
airlines over a possible aid package. There are published
reports that the President supports a $2.5 billion cash package
-- half the airlines' $5 billion cash request -- to assist the
airlines with lost revenues from the forced grounding of planes,
in addition to loans and loan guarantees. Both the executive and
legislative branches reportedly want to provide aid that
recognizes the airlines' role in last week's tragedies, but does
not assist them in revenue issues associated with the worsening
economy. A difficult task, to be sure.

Large pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY)
reportedly will pay $1 billion for a 19.9% (okay, call it 20%!)
stake in biotech cancer drug maker ImClone Systems (Nasdaq:
IMCL). The deal would value ImClone at $70 a share, a 40%
premium over yesterday's $50.01 close, and earn Bristol-Myers
U.S. and Canadian marketing rights to ImClone's proposed
monoclonal antibody cancer drug, IMC-C225, now pending Food &
Drug Administration approval for colorectal cancer, and in
trials for other cancers.

Honeywell (NYSE: HON) said that its Q3 earnings would fall below
previous estimates. The large manufacturer projected EPS of
$0.43 to $0.45, below Wall Street's $0.53 consensus. The company
also said that while its commercial aviation business provides
15% of its revenue, Honeywell remains well diversified and able
to weather a downturn in the aviation portion of its operations.

Shares of global telecom giant Cable & Wireless (NYSE: CWP)
slumped up to 12% this morning in European trading in response
to the company's warning that its first-half revenue dropped as
much as 5%. The company cited pricing pressure in voice and data
services, adding that it expected revenue for the second half of
the year to be off a similar 5%. Shares closed in the U.S.
yesterday up $0.25 to $14.06, on the low end of their 52-week
range of $13.45 to $45.63. Motley Fool telecom guru Bill Mann
covers the company regularly.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=497748

In other earnings news, Eastman Kodak (NYSE: EK) reduced its Q3
EPS forecast from $0.90-$1.20 to $0.65, Linux software vendor
Red Hat (Nasdaq: RHAT) reported a Q2 loss of $0.33 versus last
year's $0.12, and Miracle-Gro maker The Scotts Company (NYSE:
SMG) lowered FY 2001 EPS projections from $2.33-$2.63 to
$2.00-$2.15.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
POST OF THE DAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

INTEL-RAMBUS NEW CONTRACT
""Any remaining tatters of a ""special"" Rambus-Intel relationship
seem dead. Intel will no longer have a big potential stake in
Rambus shares. The agreement probably occurred now because Intel
is preparing to roll out the Brookdale, which will support both
SDRAM and DDR.""

NORTEL DROPS ESTIMATES, UPS LAYOFFS
Beleaguered telecom supplier Nortel Networks (NYSE: NT)
announced more pain after market close yesterday. The company
will cut another 20,000 jobs and expects a lowered $3.5 billion
in Q3 revenue to produce a $3.6 billion -- or $1.13 a share --
loss.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Private Rx help. Drug behemoth GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) will
reportedly announce today a national discount program for
low-income elderly individuals without prescription drug
coverage. An orange card would entitle holders to receive
discounts of 25% and higher for the drugs outside of hospitals
at most pharmacies. The company's move could be an effort to
head off government prescription coverage for the elderly, while
the price cuts could help the company's drugs better compete.
GlaxoSmithKline makes such well-known products as asthma
treatment Flovent, anti-depressant Paxil, and diabetes drug
Avandia.

Revenue depressant. Big drug maker Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) warned
this morning that while its Q3 EPS remain on track at $0.66, Q4
EPS are likely to fall to between $0.59 and $0.61. The Street
had expected Q4 numbers of $0.65. The change is due to the
decline in revenues for Lilly's blockbuster antidepressant
Prozac, which lost patent protection in August. To bolster its
drug pipeline, Lilly recently made a strategic investment in
Isis Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: ISIP)
( profiled in a recent issue of The Motley Fool Select). Lilly
shares closed yesterday at $82.87, with a 52-week range of
$70.01-$97.13.

Flexing muscles despite smaller diet. Contract manufacturer
Flextronics (Nasdaq: FLEX) continues its expansion with the
purchase of half of Xerox's manufacturing operations for $220
million. President Michael Marks reportedly told investors at a
conference on Sept. 10 that the company's new deals would lead
to a 40% revenue increase this fiscal year -- despite such
roadblocks as a slowdown in its deal with Motorola (NYSE: MOT).
Earlier this year, Sweden's Ericsson (Nasdaq: ERICY) chose
Singapore-based Flextronics as its manufacturer, and Microsoft
(Nasdaq: MSFT) also signed up with the company for the upcoming
X-Box game console.

Caught in the Crossairs? U.S. airlines aren't alone in their
suffering. Switzerland's pride and joy Swissair filed for
protection from creditors and grounded its planes after a
bank-led bailout failed to solve its financial woes. Some
reports lay the blame at the feet of the country's number one
bank UBS (NYSE: UBS), which joined Credit Suisse with a $168
million cash infusion Tuesday, but apparently too late to please
Swissair's suppliers. That deal also plans to turn Swissair's
70%-owned Crossair regional unit into a smaller national
airline. Belgium's Sabena, 49.5% owned by Swissair, has filed
for bankruptcy after Swissair failed to come through with new
cash.

POST OF THE DAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY'S FLOAT
""In short, float is cheap capital. That is, it's the ability to
use money at a cost less than you'd normally have to pay (e.g.
interest on a loan), and less than the return you can earn on
that money. Of course, it's possible to generate ""float"" that
actually costs you more than other sources of capital, but a
better description of that circumstance would be ""high interest
loan,"" since the word float really connotes some benefit to the
recipient.""

"September 20, 2001 Residuals","
RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

This notice is to inform Transmission Customers that the September 20, 2001
OATT Schedule 1 residual adjustments are artificially inflated in the first
version of the advisory billing statements.  A file used in the computation
of subzonal loads was not loaded prior to the billing run making it appear
as though no load existed in some subzones.  This  causes all DAM scheduled
purchases and bilateral transactions serving load in the affected subzones
to be sold back in the Balancing Market.  This creates an under-collection
which is then recovered from the market through the balancing energy,
losses, & congestion residuals .  The 20th will be rerun as soon as price
corrections and metered MWh values have been reconciled.  The NYISO
apologizes for any inconvenience caused by this problem.

""There was a time when a fool and his money were soon parted,
but now it happens to everybody."" -- Adlai Stevenson

TRASH COMPAQ-TER
You can restart your Compaq desktop, but can you restart Compaq
Computer (NYSE: CPQ)? The PC industry was struggling well before
last month's terrorist attacks, but now demand has come to a
screeching halt.

>>FULL STORY:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=508218

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Home is where the VCR is. Video rental chain Hollywood
Entertainment (Nasdaq: HLYW) is raising its third-quarter profit
projections after homebody consumers contributed to a stunning
11% uptick in same store sales. Second only to Blockbuster
(NYSE: BBI) in size with 1800 locations, Hollywood is now
expecting to earn between $0.15 and $0.17 a share, seven cents
above earlier estimates.

Publisher McGraw-Hill (NYSE: MHP) was supposed to be a textbook
case of down market resiliency given its steady scholastic
endeavors. However, as a magazine and trade journal maker, the
company has its work cut out for it in this lax advertising
climate. After growing revenue by 11% through the first half of
the year, the McGraw Hill is looking at sales growth in the high
single digits for the latter part of the year. With many of its
properties like BusinessWeek and the Standard & Poor's debt
rating service in the financial information field, market apathy
has also hit the company hard.

Always low prices. Always moving forward, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT)
announced that it would be accelerating its Supercenter
expansion plans. The leading retailer, which yesterday
reiterated its 4% same store sales gain targets for the month of
September, plans to open or relocate 235 outlets in fiscal 2002.
It's a move that would grow the discount department store and
wholesale club chains by 9% for the year.

I choose not to, Pikachu! Given the lack of kiddies no longer
interested in exchanging Charmander trading cards for Bulbasaurs
and Meowths, Topps (Nasdaq: TOPP) reported sales of $81.7
million for the quarter, well behind last year's $141.7 million
sum. Once better known for its sport cards franchises, if you
want to know how big Pokemon once was, consider that non-Pokemon
sales actually increased during the period. Earnings came in at
$0.20 a share, off last year's $0.68 a share showing but
actually a penny ahead of Wall Street's prediction. On deck for
Topps? Lord of the Rings and Monsters, Inc. trading cards, to
coincide with the highly anticipated theatrical releases later
this year.

Hardly news anymore, but somebody else is now suing Microsoft
(Nasdaq: MSFT). This time it is the once mighty network maven
Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL). The company is taking Microsoft to court
on the grounds of false advertising after the company shipped
marketing material to Novell customers in the form of cereal
boxes. Microsoft Server Crunch, seemingly the breakfast of
software champions, stated that Novell was moving out of
software development -- a claim Novell says is not true. I
wonder if there was a toy surprise inside?

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE OF THE MARKET
""...my grandmother was the daughter of the principle lab
assistant who helped Guglielmo Marconi, Nobel Prize winner in
physics in 1909, invent the radio. When Marconi was broke my
great grandfather, who was Marconi's only helper at the time,
gave his life savings to him in exchange for then worthless
Marconi stock. 1000s of shares were sold to him by Marconi for
25c/each and these shares were eventually to be worth $260 each
when Marconi became an international sensation.""

FIRST DATA CHARGES AHEAD

Paper or plastic?

Dour economy or not, we continue to move toward a cashless
society and electronic payment specialist First Data (NYSE: FDC)
is leading the charge. The country's leading processor of credit
card transactions, as well as the parent company of Western
Union, reported operating earnings of $0.69 a share. That
surpassed even the highest of the analyst estimates as the
company trounced the consensus projections calling for a $0.69 a
share showing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Home stocks, sweet home stocks. Housemaker D.R. Horton (NYSE:
DHI) reported record backlog levels as net sales orders
surpassed the billion-dollar mark for the fourth quarter. Given
the buoyant real estate market and dirt-cheap mortgage rates, it
was no problem for the company to drum up orders for 22,179
houses through the entire fiscal year.

Benchmark Electronics (NYSE: BHE) is comfortable with its
benchmark. The Texan-based maker of electronic parts for various
components announced that it would meet consensus cash earnings
estimates for the third quarter. However, not immune to
weakening demand, the company will be taking a $50 million to
$60 million charge in an effort to downsize and consolidate its
operations.

Give me an earnings sign. Hit me baby one more time. Pepsi
Bottling Group (NYSE: PBG), months deep into its Britney Spears
marketing campaign, did what any thirsty soul would do with a
bottle of Pepsi -- it topped it. The company reported earnings
of $0.96 a share before a one-time tax gain, a penny ahead of
market expectations. With a 3% increase in worldwide case
volume, the world's largest Pepsi seller also reiterated its
comfort with analysts' targets of $1.87 in earnings for the
year.

The red ink will run south for the Borders (NYSE: BGP) bookstore
chain. Due to soft comps since the September 11 attacks, the
retailer is now expecting to report a loss of $0.04 a share for
its fiscal third quarter. That's three cents steeper than Wall
Street was expecting. The company remains ""hopeful"" that the
seasonally strong holiday shopping period will pan out, but it's
not ready to commit to turning the page to reveal this year's
ending just yet.

It seems that Fair, Isaac & Company (NYSE: FIC) was a good
credit risk after all. The California company, which develops
credit scoring systems for the consumer credit industry, is
looking to top fourth-quarter forecasts calling for earnings of
$0.55 a share. The company now expects to earn $0.56 a share on
revenue of nearly $90 million. Last year the company earned just
$0.39 a share on a $78.7 million top-line performance.

Sometimes, it's hard to make the rent. Housestuffs lender
Rent-A-Center (Nasdaq: RCII) will miss its quarterly profit
targets despite healthy store-level sales growth. The company,
which rents out home appliances, computers, and furniture, is
looking at earnings between $0.50 and $0.52 a share. Last week
the projections were running as high as $0.70 a share. While the
company had a decent 4.6% uptick in same store comps, the
increased traffic was due to margin-crunching sales promotions.
Rent-A-Center had been a solid performer through the years by
taking advantage of a fragmented rental market to build out a
chain that is now nearly 2300 units strong. For now, though, the
company's leader may be leasing out a recliner: Chairman and CEO
Ernest Talley announced his retirement, effective immediately.

Rick Aristotle Munarriz believes that breakfast is the most
important meal of the day. So eat up! His suggestion for today
is apple French toast. Insert sweetened stewed apple slices into
thick loaf bread, batter, and pan fry. Then cover with caramel
maple syrup. Rick's stock holdings can be viewed online, as can

POST OF THE DAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

SAMSUNG AND RAMBUS
""This has to be very troubling news for the memory manufactures
betting heavily on DDR. This graph clearly shows that Samsung
expects 4i RDRAM to actually become smaller than DDR in the very
near future, with the exception of 8-bit wide DDR devices. In
this case, the difference is expected to be less than 1%.

Sumsung definitely appears to be in a Gorilla position on this
one and Rambus is along for the ride.""

"Virtual Bidding Seminars - Oct 16 & 29 - Be Ready for the New Market","
AStorey@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

NYISO opens its Virtual Marketplace on November 1. Whether you've
registered to participate in it, are considering doing so, or are
interested in its potential impact on the existing markets, you'll want to
attend one of the two upcoming seminars scheduled for October 16 and 29.

The programs will cover:
     NYISO bidding fundamentals - a short overview for those new to the
NYISO marketplace
     Virtual Transaction basics
     Virtual Transaction entry
     Virtual Transaction charges
     Billing
     Credit requirements
     Illustrations and examples
     Market Monitoring functions involving Virtual Transactions

Each one-day program will be intensive and practical. It will address your
virtual bidding options and the impact these bids will have on prices in
both the day-ahead and real-time markets. It will give you a good picture
as to how this market works and how your participation may be advantageous
to you.

The day-ahead and real-time markets will change as a result of this new
option. Therefore, this course will be extremely valuable, not only to
those bidding virtual transactions, but also to everyone bidding load or
supply in the existing energy markets.

The course will be run on the following dates as indicated:
     October 16     Albany Marriott, 189 Wolf Road, Albany, New York
     October 29     Desmond Hotel, 660 Albany-Shaker Road, Albany, New York

Course Registration will begin at 8:00 am and the course will start at 8:30
am. Wrap-up each day will be by 4:00 pm.

Register for the seminar through our web site at:

barkerde@nmenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:



While being entertained at the latest OSS working group meeting,  the limitation
of being able to only schedule MIS 14 days in advance was brought up.
Once upon a time, when business rules and bidding rules were changing faster
then tires on pit row, it was agreed to limit the entries to 14 days in order to
avoid having long term deals fail (as per nameless NYISO guy). Now that things
have slowed down and bidders are more savvy and able to babysit their bids, we
should be looking to expand the time frame for placing longer term bids in MIS.
An  informed NYISO guy (different guy by the way) said it would be easy and
using 4-5 man days to do. I have talked to Ray Kinney (Chair of the S&P WG) and
gave him the same song. If your shop would like to see the MIS limit lifted,
have your representative to the S&P WG help it along. Please don't bother Ray
directly or my TIE messages will rerouted to the Quilting Forum.

"Enron Principal Investments - Organizational Memo","
Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin.

EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight.  

EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity.

Please join me in supporting the efforts of Enron Principal Investments.

"RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel","RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to ""help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record"".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying ""show me"" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said ""FERC--just get it done""....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the ""there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...""


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

The BME-SCD Operating Reserve Comparison includes the following note:

Please explain why data for this hour each day is unreliable and how it

"Outlook Communication","Over the past few weeks, we have experienced significant issues with our email environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for Outlook users.  The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that we have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues. 
?	During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exchange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug, which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the better part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which appears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchange servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug.
?	Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experienced database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Outlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchange servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected server.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use -- we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems with the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the business week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to move users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impacted users could not access their e-mail.
?	During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and dangerous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against viruses that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail is scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktops.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day.  The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus product rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but we believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron computing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this time, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that will speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as the performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to get better.
There is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the last few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and meet Enron's business needs and expectations.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel


Today was the first day of FERC's ""RTO Week"" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was ""RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets.""  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

Woody,

I haven't gotten an answer yet from HQ whether they will do a CFD instead of
physical delivery.  We are running out of time for Monday so for next week
GMP is taking physical delivery at Chateaugay and Morgan Stanley is doing a
""wheel through"" New York and delivering the energy to NEPOOL.  HQ is on
board with that.

Next week we should have an answer from HQ about a CFD. Can we can talk next
week about a deal going forward.  GMP's contract with HQ continues until
Oct. 31, 2015.

Hi Anabeth - Ben and I were wondering about the results of your call to
HQ regarding a possible financial deal at this point

also - do you any kind of indicative offer so we see if we are even
close

we would have to work up a specific confirm for this deal but that is
fairly easily doable

pls reply to both of us

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel



 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists were:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mission; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBridge Group.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give testimony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active in the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topics are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are being rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week.  What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energy market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be standardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.    

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Schmuel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to be standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Carol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should try a couple of different systems and see what works.  

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not physical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be his preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissioner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could work together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it's okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring scheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premise, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fear that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or flowgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not agreed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgates.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitutes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstances change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially significant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on commercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if participants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedged, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable.  

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates) should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on which instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also discussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs being allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front.  

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walton was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Sarah

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"FW: Electric Utilities:  Weekly Report","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	""Russo, Brian"" <Brian.Russo@ubsw.com>@ENRON   On Behalf Of ""Abramson, Barry"" <Barry.Abramson@ubsw.com>
Sent:	Monday, October 15, 2001 6:45 AM
To:	undisclosed-recipients:;@ENRON
Subject:	Electric Utilities:  Weekly Report

KEY POINTS
*	It is like being in the eye of a hurricane as we wait to have quarterly earnings reports come pouring in.  So
far only one company, NRG Energy (NRG-$19.05, rated Strong Buy), a pure play IPP, has reported earnings, and the quarter
was slightly better than expected.  NRG also reaffirmed its full year 2001 and 2002 EPS guidance.
*	Based upon the number of favorable preannouncements that greatly outnumbered the number of negative
preannouncements, we remain confident that the third quarter reports should be relatively strong for most electric
utilities and IPPs.
*	We continue to recommend an overweighting in the electric stocks.  In an environment of economic slowdown and
falling interest rates, utility stocks should perform relatively well.
*	In addition, utility stocks still appear undervalued based upon historic valuation measures.  Utility stocks are
now trading at an average P/E ratio of 10.5x estimated 2002 EPS compared with a 2002 P/E ratio of 22.7x for the S&P 500.
The relative P/E ratio of 0.46x is well below the 25-year historic normal range of 0.60x-0.80x.
*	American Electric Power (AEP-$44.08, rated Buy)[2] agreed to acquire two huge coal-fired power plants in the
U.K. from Edison International (EIX-$15.34, rated Buy)[2].  EIX's subsidiary, Edison Mission Energy, sold the Fiddler's
Ferry and Ferrybridge power plants, each one 2,000 MW in size, for a big loss.  Since the time when EIX bought the two
power plants in 1999, power prices in the U.K. have fallen sharply and the country is now oversupplied with electric
power.  Power prices are expected to remain low in the U.K. for quite a while.  AEP agreed to pay $960 million for the
power plants and certain fuel supplies.  For AEP, the purchase price for the power plants is about $200 per kilowatt.
Edison International paid about twice as much when it purchased the plants in 1999.  EIX said that it intends to take an
after-tax write-off of about $1.18 billion to reflect the loss on the asset sale and related currency adjustments.
*	Niagara Mohawk Power (NMK-$17.75, rated Buy)[2], National Grid Group, the Staff of the New York Public Service
Commission and several other parties, announced a settlement that includes a rate plan for ten years following the
proposed merger of NMK and National Grid.  Under the agreement, Niagara Mohawk would reduce rates for electricity
delivery by $160 million, or 8%, upon closing of the merger.  Following this one-time rate cut, delivery charges would
remain stable for the next ten years.  The settlement is based upon a 10.6% return on equity with an earnings sharing
plan.  The plan allows NMK to retain 100% of earnings up to an 11.75% ROE with sharing for earnings above an 11.75% ROE.
The plan also allows NMK to retain 50% of merger-related savings and the ROE sharing plan does not include the retained
savings.  The agreement also requires NMK to give up recovery of $850 million of nuclear-related stranded costs.  The
Public Service Commission is expected to vote on the settlement by late 2001.  We would expect the state regulators to
approve the settlement and to approve the merger at the same time.  The merger is expected to be completed in the first
quarter of 2002.
*	Now it appears that Public Service of New Mexico (PNM-$26.71, rated Hold) has decided to go to court to
terminate its pending acquisition of Western Resources' utility business (WR-$17.12, rated Hold)[2].  On Friday, PNM
issued a press release saying that PNM had asked a court in New York to resolve the disagreement between PNM and WR
regarding the merger.  PNM is asking the court ""to find that it is impossible to complete the proposed transaction under
the original terms.""  PNM also wants the court to rule that the electric rate reduction imposed by regulators in Kansas
provides sufficient cause to terminate the merger agreement.  The CEO of PNM also said that PNM believes that the
current agreement must be restructured if there is any chance of the merger going ahead.  However, WR has demanded that
the original transaction be pursued even though certain rulings by state regulators in Kansas appear to make this nearly
impossible.  PNM and Western had agreed previously that WR had to complete its corporate separation plan, separating its
utility operations from its nonutility businesses, before the merger could be completed.  However, the regulators in
Kansas refused to approve the terms of WR's corporate separation plan and they have ordered a halt to the implementation
of the separation plan.  Kansas regulators want changes to be made to the corporate separation plan in order to provide
a stronger balance sheet for the utility post separation.
*	The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the acquisition of PowerGen of the U.K. by German
utility E.On last week.  Also last week, regulators in the state of Virginia approved the acquisition.  Previously, the
state of Kentucky also approved the deal.  The approvals from FERC, Virginia and Kentucky were needed because PowerGen
owns LG&E Energy, the U.S. electric utility that serves most of Kentucky and a portion of Virginia.  The SEC still needs
to approve the merger, which is expected to be completed in the spring of 2002.  We expect E.On to use this deal as a
springboard toward making several other acquisitions of U.S. utilities.  Right next door to LG&E Energy is one of our
top takeover candidates, Cinergy Corp. (CIN-$31.90, rated Strong Buy).
*	Utility stocks lagged the overall market last week.  For the five trading days last week, electric utility
stocks went down in value by 3.9% compared with a gain of 1.9% for the S&P 500.  IPP stocks had a strong week, with an
average stock appreciation of 8.2%

"A Nation Challenged: Complete Coverage From NYTimes.com","Dear Member,

It has been more than a month since the tragic events of
September 11.  And I want to express my personal
appreciation to the many thousands of readers from around
the world who have sent in words of sympathy to the people
of this country and in particular of New York City.  The
New York Times on the Web has kept open the area reserved
for these messages, and you are free to read them on our
site.

The unfolding developments on the military and public
health areas are covered in great depth by the Times'
staff of reporters and editors. To make it easier to catch
up on the past six weeks of coverage, we have created a
special section on the Web called ""A Nation Challenged.""
This includes a day-by-day rundown of events as well as an
archive of past coverage.

http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/dayofterror/index.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041ECD041E924Krtg012000mUxrvUxgm

With so many correspondents involved in coverage of this
crisis, we felt it might illuminate some of the background
to these stories to have conversations with many of them.
You can listen to conversations with such veteran
correspondents as R.W. Apple, John F. Burns, David Sanger,
Judith Miller, and many others.

In a further effort to provide some unusual background to
the situation, Vincent Laforet, a New York Times staff
photographer, gives a first person account of being among
the refugees in Pakistan in ""Photographer's Journal,"" a personal
multimedia essay.   His photos explore refugees piecing
together a Koran, spending time in an opium den and living
in a Pakistani school. Vincent accompanies the essay with
an audio description.

I have to confess to being a fervent New York Yankees fan,
going back to my childhood as a boy in the Bronx. Many New
Yorkers got a tremendous lift by the Yankees' comeback
against a very strong Oakland Athletics team. By the time
you read this you may know whether the Yankees won or lost
against the Seattle Mariners in the championship series
leading up to the World Series.

TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

DEFENSE SECTOR BUYOUT BATTLE
With defense stocks in the spotlight amid a heated-up political
and military environment -- which yesterday saw the U.S. begin
what is reportedly a broad-reaching campaign in Afghanistan --
merger and acquisitions activity in the sector appears to be hot
as well. On Friday, Newport News Shipbuilding (NYSE: NNS) said
it may receive a buyout proposal from Northrop Grumman (NYSE:
NOC) that beats General Dynamics' (NYSE: GD) current offer.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=511723

Paul Larson in early May reported that Newport, a maker of
nuclear-powered Naval vessels -- agreed to sell to defense
contractor General Dynamics for $67.50 per share in cash. It
looked to be a happy ending to a long-running soap opera: The
companies were set to merge in 1999 before Newport, unhappy with
the buyout price and concerned about regulatory problems, balked.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=511724

Those problems seemed taken care of earlier this year -- but
there was still the matter of Northrop, which tried to divert
Newport News with a similar offer that, because it contained
less cash than did General Dynamics', didn't get the job done
with Newport News.

This time Northrop hopes to be successful. According to a
Newport News press release, a revitalized offer from Northrop is
worth approximately $72.67 per share, and that was enough to get
the companies back around the negotiating table.

The talks are just talks -- and with the new offer potentially a
superior one, Newport News would be remiss in its duty to
stockholders were it not to consider it -- but it appears that
the intrigue in the defense business is heating up again. (Two
Fools debated the merit of defense stocks in last week's Dueling
Fools feature.)

Office supply retailer Staples (Nasdaq: SPLS) said it is
reportedly liquidating its stock of PCs to lower inventory as
the market for computers continues to slow. The company will
then focus on build-to-order. ""Stocked computers are a
relatively low margin category for us,"" a Staples spokesman told
Reuters, ""and they do take up valuable shelf and stockroom space
which we could use for other products.""

Enron (NYSE: ENE) agreed to sell its Portland General Electric
utility subsidiary to Northwest Natural Gas (NYSE: NWN) in a
deal that will include, among other things, $1.55 billion in
cash, a total of $250 million in preferred and common stock, and
other considerations. The deal is expected to close by the end
of last year. Jeffrey Skilling surprised Enron investors when he
up and left the company back in August.

Compaq (NYSE: CPQ) announced a five-year deal to provide IT
services to GE Aircraft Engines, a division of General Electric
(NYSE: GE) in North and South America. The deal, which extends a
current pact, is worth $95 million.

Apple Computer (Nasdaq: APPL) continues to open retail stores as
it looks for ways to market its products effectively to
consumers. Stores in New York and Germantown, Tenn., were
announced today, while a Palo Alto, Calif., store was announced
last week. (Mike Trigg visited Apple's first store back in May.)

Sausage and restaurant company Bob Evans Farms (Nasdaq: BOBE)
said it sold its Hickory Farms smoke flavorings subsidiary to
Irish company Kerry Farms for an undisclosed cash sum. The
company expects a one-time gain of between $0.08 and $0.10 per
share in its fiscal second quarter ended Oct. 26. The proceeds
will be used to repurchase shares and pay off short-term debt.

Dave Marino-Nachison owns shares of General Electric. More

BEA - WHAT IS APPLICATION SERVER SOFTWARE?
Yes, application server software is traditionally considered
middleware. It is often compared to any operating system because
it doesn't do anything on its own, but instead provides services
to developers. Rather than giving a detailed feature list of
services provided by an application server, let me give a simple
scenario.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Subject:	FW: ERCOT LSE's

Kevin and Rogers,

After meeting with Ader yesterday to discuss some LSE topics and sending him a polite, to the point email, I received this email response from him.  This email completely misrepresents what was dicussed and makes me look bad to management.  I am about ready for war, so I think it is better that someone else look at this before I do something to get fired.  I have never been so completely disgusted with someone who is supposed to be a figure of respect and authority, and is a Vice President at a company like Enron.  My email was addressed to Ader and Bernstein and copied Rogers and Nancy Hetrick since these are the people who have knowledge of the subject matter.  For him to copy the people he did, and hide behind his contacts, while lying about our conversation, and skewing it in a manner in which I would never act, is inexcusable.  I would expect more from a 4th grader.  Sorry for the ranting and raving.  Kevin - Rogers is out today, so if you would like to discuss this further, please call me at 33143.  Thanks.

-Joe

Subject:	Re: ERCOT LSE's

Joe,

I requested a meeting with you yesterday to work with you and convey what we have learned over the last three months by working with regulatory and the ERCOT ISO to utilize and create additional LSE accounts.  As you were informed by Nancy Hetrick of regulatory all three currently available LSE account are committed by Structured Supply for use under currently negotiated masters.  We requested the meeting with you yesterday to explain what we were doing and why we needed the other three EES LSE accounts.  We also took the time to explain the process for establishing new LSE accounts, under a LLC structure which is not complicated, but the structure that the new LSE accounts would be created under (SPV) is inconsistent with the masters negotiated and EES would not be able to perform under these masters.

We have tried to work with you in cooperation to accomplish your goals consistent with the constraints of the ERCOT rules.  We have explained our needs and the reason for them. We conveyed our interest in working together to accomplish the greater good for the company and offered our help in any way we could.  You mark and I agreed that it would be easier to help each other and not duplicate efforts.  We were appreciative of your willingness to proceed consistent with this spirit of cooperation.  It disheartens and surprises me that you would leave the meeting with this understanding and in agreement of the business situation and send an e-mail the next morning, without picking up the phone or stopping by to discuss this and just attempt to dictatorially commandeer the LSE accounts that you knew were committed and why they were committed.  

Moreover; you told us that you thought you might need one more and you have attempted to take three more.

Best regards,


Jeff

Thank you for taking the time to discuss the LSE situation in ERCOT.  The present LSE was set up by EES and is being utilized by EWS Retail and EWS Services Group, for physical delivery in ERCOT for EES load.  In order to better manage EES volume and structure growth in ERCOT, billing issues, and optimization of the present and future portfolio, EES/EWS Retail will require the use of the sub LSE's available under EES's existing LSE arrangement.  Structured Supply will be responsible for the creation of any LLC's that need to be created to facilitate additional LSE availability.  If you have any questions or comments, please either email or call me (ext 33143).  Thanks.

      meeting


Responding to Tim Lynch's comments:

The BME-SCD Operating Reserve Comparison includes the following note:
""Data for BME hours beginning 0:00 was not reliable, assumed all hours were
not short.""

Please explain why data for this hour each day is unreliable and how it
impacts customer bills.  We are troubled that after operating a system for
nearly two years, problems remain that cause this magnitude of inaccuracy.

Tim Lynch
NYSEG Energy Trading
********************

As was explained at the PITF meeting the footnote in question related to a
data transferral problem between the NYISO and LECG that had NO IMPACT on
the BME prices, schedules or any billing matters.

To collate the data for the PITF meeting in a meaningful way it was
necessary to track the state of the 30 minute reserve constraint i.e. was
BME able to purchase sufficient 30 minute reserves to meet the pool 30
minute reserve requirement. LECG's information for the status of the 30
minute reserve constraint for hour beginning 0:00 was unreliable because of
data tranferral and processing problems so we made the very reasonable
assumption that in the middle of the night there is little chance that we
were reserve short. The footnote was entirely reasonable given the context
of the discussion for which the data was prepared.

Thank-you

Sent:	Thursday, September 27, 2001 8:00 AM
To:	Gualy, Jaime
Subject:	Parrella-IPPs- Reiterating Ratings on CPN, NRG, MIR

* Casualties of yesterday?s 49% decline in AES included Calpine (CPN; $21.40; C-1-1-9), NRG Energy (NRG; $13.72; C-1-1-9) and Mirant (MIR; $21.10; C-2-1-9); these stocks declined 9%-10%.  At P/E multiples of barely above 8x our 2002 estimates, we regard this as an attractive opportunity.
How are the AES issues different?
* AES earnings shortfall mostly from outside U.S.:  The two single-largest components of the shortfall were the weak Brazilian currency and weak U.K. power prices.  Very little of the shortfall was attributable to U.S. businesses.  CPN, NRG and MIR derive the vast majority of their income from the U.S.  We do not see any negative implications for the global businesses of any of these companies; see specific comments below.
* Market leader disappointment a more significant factor:  The poor performance of companies like Enron and AES this year has been a major negative to psychology, even though many of the issues these companies have been challenged by (global, broadband) are not endemic to the sector.
What continues to bother these stocks?
* Investor concerns about potential oversupply have been accentuated by the events of September 11.  That is because power demand growth is likely to slow, perhaps to 0%-1% from 2%, in a U.S. recession.  If planned supply additions are unchanged, this could hasten the arrival of an ?overbuild.?
* Weak equity valuations make equity issuance extremely unattractive and unlikely.  Inability to raise equity calls into question the ability to complete capacity expansion plans, which have been the key driver of earnings growth.
Stocks look cheap, but what are the potential catalysts?
* Scaling back of capacity expansion plans:  We expect to see project cancellations and/or deferrals, particularly those targeted for commercial operation in 2003-2005.  The capital markets discipline currently being exerted makes this almost inevitable, in our view.  We are aware that a number of companies are undertaking reviews at present of all projects that have not yet broken ground.  Removing some of the more marginal projects would reduce the risk of overbuild in 2003.  The 80,000 Mw proposed for that year could be scaled back to about 50,000 Mw.
* Investor comfort with revised growth targets:  As part of this process, managements are likely to begin talking lower growth rates for the 2003-2005 period. We expect these to remain solidly double-digit, and still well

Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.

When it detects an attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source, keeping intruders from accessing your system. 
By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by these two products.  
Instructions for accessing the Portal and downloading the software are provided below.
If you have any questions or wish to provide feedback, please email clickathome@enron.com.  Thank you for your participation in ClickAtHome.

"Enron Center South (ECS) Move Back-up Plan","


A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

Woody,

I haven't gotten an answer yet from HQ whether they will do a CFD instead of
physical delivery.  We are running out of time for Monday so for next week
GMP is taking physical delivery at Chateaugay and Morgan Stanley is doing a
""wheel through"" New York and delivering the energy to NEPOOL.  HQ is on
board with that.

Next week we should have an answer from HQ about a CFD. Can we can talk next
week about a deal going forward.  GMP's contract with HQ continues until
Oct. 31, 2015.

Hi Anabeth - Ben and I were wondering about the results of your call to
HQ regarding a possible financial deal at this point

also - do you any kind of indicative offer so we see if we are even
close

we would have to work up a specific confirm for this deal but that is
fairly easily doable

pls reply to both of us

thanks

Woody and Ben

04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a ""material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" it warned.

"NYISO - MIS Outage - October 17, 2001 - Reminder Notice","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

*****Reminder Notice************

Dear Market Participants

On October 17, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will
require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be
transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system
be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.  The outage will begin at
approximately 11:35 AM.  Market Participants planning on submitting
HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.

The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible

"FW: Summary RTO Week Day 2 -- Planning & Expansion","

 


  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.
Steve

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.

TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

AOL'S PLEASANT SURPRISE
Media giant AOL Time Warner (NYSE: AOL), who brought America
extensive commercial-free coverage of September 11, reported its
third-quarter earnings today, and they weren't the disaster
everyone expected. Revenue hit $9.32 billion, 6.4% ahead of last
year's pro forma $8.76 billion. Analysts had been expecting
$9.14 billion, following AOL's warning on September 25 that
revenue would only grow 5-7%.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Who says October is bad for stocks? Earnings releases from tech
bellwethers Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) are
expected to lead the markets higher today. Chip manufacturer
Intel last night reported that third-quarter revenue dropped 25%
and net income dropped 96%. However, earnings met Wall Street's
estimates of $0.10 a share. IBM did Intel one better by beating
the Streets expectations by a penny. Like Intel, IBM's
third-quarter revenue and earnings were also down, but by just
6% and 19%, respectively.

Earnings season is in full swing again. (Have you bought
earnings seasons gifts for your loved ones yet?

Time is running out!) Here's a rundown of some of the other
major companies and how they fared:

--International Paper (NYSE: IP) handily topped estimates of
  $0.05 per share, reporting earnings of $0.14. That reflects earnings for the
  third quarter of 2001 of $68 million, compared to $260 million a
  year ago.

--Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) reported third-quarter earnings of $0.34
  per share, a penny ahead of analyst estimates. The company expects double-digit
  revenue growth in 2002.

--Ford (NYSE: F), the world's No. 2 automaker, lost as much as
  analysts were expecting. Not counting charges and gains, the company lost
  $0.28 per share, compared to a profit of $0.50 in the year-ago
  period. Revenue was down 9% over the past 12 months.

--Citigroup (NYSE: C) met its lowered expectations, earning
  $0.63 per share, compared with a gain of $0.68 a year ago. The company expects
  its next quarter's earnings to grow by 15%.

--Data storage company EMC (NYSE: EMC) reported its first loss
  in some 12 years, losing nearly a billion dollars in the third quarter, compared
  to a half-billion-dollar gain a year ago.

AMD - MORE HAMMER DETAILS
""I know it sounds ridiculous, but here is the bind that Intel is
in. If vendors see a strong consumer preference for Tualatin
over the Willamette, the Pentium 4 will be seen as a failure. If
the supply chain sees the Pentium 4 as a failure they won't
rush--heck they won't even crawl--to support the socket 478 platform,
in particular the SDRAM and DDR versions of Brookdale. Once Northwood
is shipping in quantity, and Intel has enough 0.13 micron fab capacity,
then Intel can afford to hype Tualatin. But that point is six months
to a year away.""

$22,000 for O&M??

I am not sure how in the world this can be considered a typical example.
Where are the taxes?
Where are the interest payments?
Return on Investment?

If the objective is to grossly misrepresent the cost of a GT then this
is a typical example.

"Important NYC Marathon information","The New York City Marathon will take place as scheduled on Sunday, November
4, 2001.

In the wake of the terrible events of September 11, the New York City
Marathon will highlight the diversity, energy, and resilience of New York
City as never before, said Allan Steinfeld, race director of the New York
City Marathon and president and CEO of New York Road Runners.

No course changes are planned, as the five-borough New York City Marathon
route does not go near the site of the World Trade Center disaster in lower
Manhattan.

Steinfeld added, New York Road Runners is dedicating the 2001 New York City
Marathon to the victims of the tragic events of September 11, and to the
courageous rescuers who have worked tirelessly to save lives and to rebuild
our great city and nation.

Please join New York Road Runners, our sponsors and partners, and runners
from around the world in our effort to raise $1 million for the Twin Towers
Fund, a united and coordinated effort to assist victims of the September 11
disaster and their families, and the families of the firefighters, police
officers, emergency medical technicians, and Port Authority police involved
in the rescue and recovery effort. To support this initiative, make your
donation to Twin Towers Fund and send it to:

New York Road Runners
Attn: Twin Towers Fund

GATEWAY GUIDES LOWER
The bad news just keeps on coming for Gateway (NYSE: GTW). After
the market closed yesterday, the troubled computer maker warned
investors that it would lose $0.14 to $0.17 a share in the third
quarter, excluding special charges. It had previously expected
to lose only $0.04 a share.

In a moving statement yesterday, eSpeed (Nasdaq: ESPD) chairman
and CEO Howard Lutnick announced his firm's shares will resume
trading today. eSpeed is the electronic brokerage subsidiary of
Cantor Fitzgerald, which lost more than 730 employees when the
World Trade Center was attacked. ""eSpeed will never forget,
never settle, and never give up,"" said Lutnick. ""It is our
promise that this company will stand as a testament to those we
have lost and a badge of honor to those who have survived.""

Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) stock sweetened up more than 10% in
after-hours trading after the company said it's sticking with
its fiscal 2001 target of $0.46 a share. The world's top coffee
retailer saw same-store sales for the five weeks ended Sept. 30
increase 1% despite the fact all its shops in North America were
closed early on Sept. 11. Starbucks Chairman and Chief Global
Strategist Howard Schultz even said the current economic
conditions ""provide a favorable environment to aggressively
pursue our global expansion strategy.""

Another company reaffirming its quarterly target was Tommy
Hilfiger (NYSE: TOM). The trendy clothing retailer said its
fiscal second quarter should meet expectations, but ""in light of
continuing economic weakness and the impact on consumer
confidence"" caused by the terrorist attacks, the company is
lowering its full-year EPS target. CEO Joel Horowitz said he's
particularly concerned about the holiday season.

Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD) said early this morning that
third-quarter sales would come in around $766 million, a decline
of 22% from the second quarter. The chip maker expected only a
15% sequential decline. Chief executive W.J. Sanders III said
average selling prices for PC processors fell sharply in the
face of ""very aggressive competition,"" but believes his company
maintained, or even gained, market share.

Grocery giants Safeway (NYSE: SWY) and Albertson's (NYSE: ABS)
are teaming up in a lawsuit against the United Food and
Commercial Workers labor union. The two companies say the UFCS
""engaged in blatant voting irregularities'' in a vote to approve
a new labor contract. According to the lawsuit, some union
locals are attempting to kill the contract offer by various
means, including denying some employees the chance to vote and
allowing others to vote twice.

Standard & Poor's said yesterday that Teco Energy (NYSE: TE)
will be added to the S&P 500 Index next week. Teco will replace
Global Crossing (NYSE: GX), which is getting the boot due to
""lack of representation."" Global is trading at just over $1 a
share.

With an upper deck shot in the 9th inning in Houston, San
Francisco outfielder Barry Bonds hit his 70th home run of the
year last night, tying Mark McGwire's single-season record.
Bonds will have a chance to break the record at home now, as the
Giants close out the season with a three-game series against
arch-rival Los Angeles, beginning tonight.

MORNINGSTAR ON QCOM
""The report offers one criticism of QCOM which I thought did
make sense, and which I haven't seen any discussion of on this
board, and that has to do with the accounting framework which
QCOM prefers to report trends in earnings and expenses. In
particular, the frequency and regularity of one-time charges
taken struck me as suspect. Since QCOM excludes these charges
from its customary pro-forma income statements, the growth in
earnings gets overstated, and the growth in expenses and related
costs understated. In some cases, the differences between the
pro-forma and GAAP statements for the same quarter are
exceptionally large.""

"NYISO - MIS Outage - October 31, 2001 - Reminder Notice","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants

******************Reminder Notice***********************************

Note:  The following change was originally scheduled for October 17, 2001.

On October 31, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will
require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be
transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system
be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.  The outage will begin at
approximately 11:35 AM.  Market Participants planning on submitting
HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.

The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible
as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.  Ultimately,
these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced
services that the current web servers are unable to perform.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You

"RE: Draft NYISO Statement On External ICAP from ISO-NE","
JCharlton@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:




ISO-NE has a filing pending at FERC to eliminate their ability to recall
energy from Resources selling ICAP into NY.  If FERC approves the filing,
the ISO will accept up to 350 MW of ICAP from the ISO-NE control area,
subject to the maximum 2558 MW of Installed Capacity located outside the
NYCA in accordance with Attachment B of the Installed Capacity Manual.
Installed Capacity in this context will be in the form of the ICAP
equivalent of the qualified Unforced Capacity (UCAP) sold, consistent with
the ICAP equivalent calculations in Attachment J of the ICAP Manual.

ISO-NE has requested an effective date for its filing of October 22 so FERC
is not expected to approve the ISO-NE tariff changes before then. The next
ICAP Supplier and LSE certifications are due to the NYISO on October 23.
The deficiency auction is scheduled on October 25. In accordance with the
last paragraph of Section 4.9.3 of the ICAP Manual, the ISO plans to open
the period for requesting such rights at 8:00 a.m. on October 18 and close
the request period at 5:00 p.m on October 22. This request period is
conditioned on a timely approval of the elimination of
recall rights by ISO-NE.

Resources located in New England (as well as PJM or HQ) that want to
qualify as ICAP Suppliers in New York must comply with the equirements set
forth in Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.9 of the ICAP Manual. The NYISO
encourages Resources to submit DMNC test results, Operating Data and other
required information as soon as possible to allow their participation in
the ICAP market if and when the Commission approves the elimination of the
recall procedures in New England.

As we near the end of the year, I want to make clear some individual VAR limits I have come up with as we go forward.  These will change from time to time as to allocate VAR to desks that are profitable and re-adjust VAR when desks are not profitable.  Please read carefully.  If you have any questions feel free to see me.  There will be penalties for not staying within your VAR limits.  I will be reasonable but fines will be assessed for repeated breakage.

"November & December 1999 Settlement Adjustments","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants:

On the November 1999 & December 1999 Transmission Customer Monthly
Statements many customers have noted under the ""Energy Settlement"" section
for ""Forward Energy"" a change in MW-Hrs with no associated change in dollar
amounts.  This is because of a correction in the sign convention for the
MW-Hrs related to external generation transactions (transactions from a
proxy bus to the NYISO reference bus).  For all other types of transactions
the NYISO charges customers the appropriate TUC or LBMP  based on the MWs
that flowed, but for external generation transactions, customers receive
payments from the NYISO, and therefore these types of transactions have an
opposite sign convention.

The dollars associated with the external generation transactions have
always had the proper sign convention, but the MW-Hrs have not.  On
01/17/2000 this sign convention was corrected for all billing months going
forward resulting in the correct MW-Hr values being reported from February
2000 to date.  However, November 1999 - January 2000 did not have the
proper MW-Hrs reported on the Transmission Customer Monthly Statements.
With the latest settlement adjustments posted the MW-Hrs are being
corrected with the proper sign convention.  Transmission Customers will see
similar changes in their forward energy MW-Hrs for January 2000's
settlement adjustment.

If you have any questions please contact your Customer Relations
representative at 518-356-6060.

=================================================================
YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

Q. HOW COULD A COMPANY HAVE A PRICE-TO-EARNINGS (P/E) RATIO OF
77 AND A PROJECTED P/E OF 22?

A. If it currently trades at $77 per share and has $1 per share
in annual earnings, its P/E is 77. If it's growing rapidly and
is expected to earn $3.50 next year, the projected P/E for that
year is 22 (77 divided by 3.50 is 22).

Q. WHY DO BONDS FALL IN VALUE WHEN INTEREST RATES RISE?

A. To be precise, the prices of existing bonds will fall when
interest rates rise. The prices of newly issued bonds are fixed.
But let's back up a bit. Higher interest rates mean that
companies are likely to borrow less, produce less and thus earn
less. Since stock prices are tied to how much a company can
earn, higher interest rates theoretically cause stock prices to
fall. This, coupled with rising bond interest rates, makes bonds
more attractive to investors.

Imagine 5 percent bonds with 10 years left until maturity that
originally sold for $1,000 each. If you buy these bonds now,
you'll be getting $50 per year from each of them and then $1,000
at maturity. But if interest rates have risen since those bonds
were issued and you can buy new 10-year bonds that pay you 10
percent, that amounts to $100 per year per $1,000 invested. You
would obviously be willing to pay more for the 10-percent bonds
than the 5 percent ones. So the price of 5 percent bonds will
fall. It will fall to the point where $1,000 invested in the 5
percent bond will bring you same total yield-to-maturity as
$1,000 invested in the new bond.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
THIS WEEK'S LESSON

BANKING THE RIGHT WAY
All banks are not alike. You may have chosen yours for one good
reason, but learn more about your options and you might discover
some ways to save money. Here are some things to chew on:

- If you chose a bank due to its location, know that these days,
with newfangled inventions like the telephone, direct deposit,
the U.S. mail system, and even, dare we say, the Internet, you
don't need to be particularly close to a bricks-and-mortar
branch of any bank

- A good way to figure out exactly which of a bank's services
you most need to pay attention to is to make a list. Jot down
the following items on a sheet of lined paper and make three
columns, where you enter how much you spent for each category in
each of the past three months: ATM surcharges, ""foreign"" ATM
fees, other ATM fees, overdrafts, monthly maintenance fees,
check printing, deposit/other slips, call center charges, debit
card fees, low-balance penalty, per-check charges, return
check/NSF fees, money order fees, traveler's checks, and other
bank fees. This will help you quickly see where your money is
going and what features you should examine when evaluating a
bank.

- If you're parking any money in CDs, make sure you look around
for the best rates. Check sites such as Bankrate.com and you
could end up earning 2 percent more at a small bank a few states
away.

Bankrate.com:
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=497032

- You can often get a higher interest rate on your checking
account at a small regional bank than at a big national one.
Better still, some discount brokerages are now offering banking
services. TD Waterhouse is a good example, offering money market
accounts, checking, direct deposit, and more (Waterhouse.com, 800-839-2837).

Waterhouse.com:
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=497033

- Use direct deposit. It saves time and some banks will give you
free checking if you use it.

- Don't order checks from your bank, which might charge as much
as $25 for 200. You can get the same thing for a quarter of the
price through services such as Currentchecks.com (800-204-2244)
or Checksinthemail.com (877-397-1541).

23:00 today, Friday, September 28, 2001.  The NYISO apologizes for any
inconvenience resulting in the delay in posting these invoices.

Transmission  Customers  will  observe adjustments to their settlements to:
(1)  recover  costs  related  to  adjustments  made  outside of the billing
process;  (2)  adjust regulation penalty charges to zero for suppliers; and
(3)  adjust  the  NYISO  clearing account balance to zero for December 1999
settlements.

With  regard  to the adjustments made outside of the billing process, these
adjustments  could not have been corrected by a billing code or determinant
data fix.  As a result, the mechanism of paying and funding the adjustments
is   done  outside  of  the  billing  process.   The  total  adjustment  of
$581,563.37  was  allocated  across 13,147,961 MWh.  Customers may validate
their  respective  adjustments  by  computing  their  ratio  shares  of the
$581,563.37  using  5,059,790  MWh  as  the denominator in their respective
ratios of their December 1999 load.  Customers will observe a difference in
the  denominators  used  in  the  ratio share allocation of this adjustment
versus  adjustment  #3.   This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the costs for
adjustment  #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the
adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment.

Prior  to  October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the
revenue   received  from  Schedule  1  charges,  which  were  comprised  of
forecasted  uplift  & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred
by  adjusting  subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.  In October
2000,  the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions
that  allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In  order  to  allow  any  changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be
settled  through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in
October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.  This results in
an  over-collection  which  is  being  returned  to  Customers  through  an
adjustment  to  their  monthly  balances.   This  billing treatment for the
December  1999  settlement  adjustments  resulted  in credits to the market
totaling  $5,219,402.09  allocated  across 13,191,237 MWh.  Customers where
allocated their portion of adjustment #3 above, based upon their respective
ratio shares of the 13,191,237 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for
the month.

December  1999  settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to
address  the  delay  in  invoicing.  Payments due to the NYISO for December
1999  settlement  adjustments  are due to be received in the NYISO clearing
account  on  Monday, October 15, 2001.  Payments due to market participants
will  be  made on Friday, October 19, 2001.  Please refer to the attachment
below for banking instructions.

Randy A. Bowers
Manager - Customer Settlements

TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

GOVERNMENT ACCELERATES AID TO AIRLINES
While Congress works on legislation that will provide financial aid to airlines,
President Bush will ask lawmakers to hand over $5 billion in immediate cash
to the shell-shocked industry. The Associated Press, quoting an anonymous administration
official, says the cash would be coupled with help for the airlines' insurance
liabilities.

The House of Representatives hopes to rush through a $24 billion aid package
that will be quickly sent to the Senate, and could possibly reach the president's
desk before next week. That package would include loans as well as some cash
that would not have to be repaid. Continental Airlines (NYSE: CAL) CEO Gordon
Bethune says the industry is currently losing $15 million per hour, and the
package is needed to restore some stability to the situation.

In the meantime, more airlines announced staff reductions after the market closed
yesterday. First, Mesa Air (Nasdaq: MESA) said it would cut 700 jobs and implement
a temporary 10% pay reduction for most employees. Senior management's pay has
already been reduced by 20%, and both the CEO and the company's president took
a 50% cut.

Later, heavyweights American Airlines parent AMR Corp. (NYSE: AMR) and United
Airlines parent UAL (NYSE: UAL) announced layoffs of some 20,000 employees
each. That represents 14% of American's staff, and 20% of United's. Following
Boeing's (NYSE: BA) actions Wednesday, job cuts now total almost 100,000
people industry wide.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=499860

One company bucking the layoff trend, however, is SkyWest Airlines (Nasdaq:
SKYW). COO Ron Reber says no layoffs are in the works. The company's ""plans
for growth are still intact,"" he says, and it still plans to take delivery of
the 106 Canadair Regional Jets it ordered from manufacturer Bombardier. SkyWest
operates as United Express and Delta Connection in 74 cities.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Media companies have also been adversely affected by the terrorist attacks.
Knight-Ridder (NYSE: KRI) and Tribune Co. (NYSE: TRB), which teamed up
in August to acquire online job recruitment site Headhunter.NET (Nasdaq: HHNT),
both came out with bad news after the bell yesterday. Knight-Ridder CEO Tony
Ridder says many advertisers pulled ads after the attacks, and, combined with
the increased expenses due to extended coverage of the tragedy, he expects about
a 25% year-over-year drop in earnings per share. Citing the same reasons, Tribune
expects third-quarter and full-year earnings to come in below expectations.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=499862

The Securities and Exchange Commission says it doesn't yet know if those associated
with last Tuesday's hijackings also exploited the markets in order to profit
from the attacks. The agency says it's ""vigorously pursuing all credible leads,""
but wouldn't release any other details.

Networking equipment maker 3Com (Nasdaq: COMS) reported fiscal first-quarter
results that saw revenue fall 58% from the same period last year. The company
also ""found opportunities"" to reduce staffing by another 1,000 people and expects
to end the quarter with 6,000 workers. It employed 12,000 last November.

The nation's number-two hospital operator, Tenet Healthcare (NYSE: THC), says
it will top estimates when it releases fiscal first-quarter earnings on Oct.
3. Its expected earnings per share of $0.65 - $0.67 would represent 35-40% growth
over last year.

Rex Moore's mental acuity has shown a 3%-5% year-over-year decrease, though
it's up inconsequentially sequentially. At press time he held no positions in
any of the companies mentioned in this article. The Motley Fool is investors

AND ONE FINAL MESSAGE
As always, the safety of the participants, spectators, staff, and
volunteers in the New York City Marathon is of paramount concern to both
the City of New York and New York Road Runners. We cannot publicize the
details of the security effort, which is provided by local, state, and
federal agencies. In light of the recent terrorist attacks, it will be even
more encompassing than usual.

"new generation in NY","Attached is a spreadsheet that lists all the new generation projects that need artcicle X permitting for New York.  The newest generation coming online is Coneds 360 MW East River Repowering slated for Q4 2002.  However, after speaking to Coned this morning this plan seems a little ambitous and won't probably come online until 2003.  Construction on this project has not yet begun and will be GE Frame7s.  The only substantial MWs under construction is PG&E's Athens plant which is 1080 MWs in Zone F slated for Q3 2003.  Everything else posted is still in planning stages.  However, these numbers do not show any generation under 80 MW that don't require an article X permitting process.  The estimated amount of potential new supply for NYC is 380MW and 204MW for Long Island that could come online that don't require permitting.  

Overall supply recap,  no new sizeable generation slated probably until end of 2003 or early 2004.  Last summer on Aug9 the NYISO peaked at 31,050 MW and Coned peaked at 12,134 MW.  The NYISO predicts that given an extreme weather case the max demand  can goto 32,290 MW.  I will keep everybody updated on any new supply changes.  You can access this website  http://www.dps.state.ny.us/articlex.htm  whichs shows the new generation projects in NY.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Whats up?  I think tomorrow seems to be a big ax day over here for many of the groups in EIM and EGM.  It's getting pretty grim here on the trading floor.  Most people seem to think that this deal will not go through and that we will go into Ch. 7.  Trading has really slowed down.  How do things look over there?

""The older we get, the more we realize that service to others is
the only way to stay happy."" -- Carl Holmes

TOP STORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

FEDERATED'S SEPTEMBER CHILL
Federated Department Stores (NYSE: FD), operator of such chains
as Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and Lazarus, said September business
has dropped off dramatically since the terrorist attacks that
targeted New York and Washington on the 11th.

>>FULL STORY:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=501894

-----------------------------------------------------------------
NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Internet infrastructure firm VeriSign (Nasdaq: VRSN) agreed to
buy wireless communications network services company Illuminet
(Nasdaq: ILUM) in a stock deal valued at approximately $1.2
billion based on Friday's closing prices.

Aircraft maker Boeing (NYSE: BA) agreed to pay $92.5 million to
settle a class action stockholder lawsuit filed against the
company in 1997. Stockholders alleged that the company withheld
information about production problems, hurting the company's
share price. Boeing recently announced broad job cuts.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=501895

A story in today's Los Angeles Times cites unnamed sources as
saying file-swapping maverick Napster may soon ink a deal with
an agency that represents many leading recording companies,
which may free up the company to launch a fee-based music
download service. While the company already has deals with some
labels, they won't take effect until the new service debuts.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=501896

American Trans Air parent company AmTran (Nasdaq: AMTR) said
Citigroup's (NYSE: C) Citicorp and Salomon Smith Barney withdrew
their commitment to finance the company's planned going-private
transaction. AmTran is currently evaluating its options but is
not sure the deal will go through. Paul Larson covered the
situation facing several airline operators last week.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=501897

Internet software vendor Novell (Nasdaq: NOVL) extended its
stock buyback plan through June 30, 2002, and said $400 million
was available for use. Many companies have restarted or extended
their buyback plans following last week's poor market
performance.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=501898

Vacation rental property management company ResortQuest (NYSE:
RZT) said it would cut 100 jobs and institute pay and hiring
freezes as it looks to reduce overhead during what is expected
to be a difficult time for travel companies. Boca Resorts (NYSE:
RST), meanwhile, lowered its guidance for the second half of the
year. Cruise lines were among the companies reporting bad news
last week.

POST OF THE DAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

BUFFETT SAYS...
""[Bill Mann] Buy and Hold is only defenseless when it is applied
without any view of business realities. Buy and Hold cannot
protect one from bad buy decisions, which JDS Unipahse at $150
undoubtedly was, as Lucent at nearly any price was. That Buffett
makes better buy decisions than most is irrefutable.""

"Lay It On the Line Survey Results","Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	More	Same	Less	N/A

Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2%	
Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	


_________________________________________________________________________________________
IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:

---   ability to embrace change
---   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:
---	pay and benefits
---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

"FW: Comments on the Status of ENE ($16/sh).","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	""John Gualy"" <jgualy@eagleglobal.com>@ENRON  
Sent:	Friday, October 26, 2001 10:33 AM
To:	Gualy, Jaime
Subject:	FW: Comments on the Status of ENE ($16/sh).






--------------- Authored by: Jeff Dietert ----------------
OUR VIEW:  ENE is down huge (-80% for the year, and trading at only
7.5xFY02) and its hard to imagine more confusion associated with the stock.
More pressure is likely today on the news of S&P revising its long-term
ratings outlook to negative (based on the decline in market capitalization)
and ENE's additional draw on its credit facilities (which does not change
its net debt, but prevents banks from denying access to its liquidity in
the event that the rating agencies do downgrade its credit rating, which
could break covenants and restrict liquidity).  We believe the major issues
are: 1) management's ability to regain the confidence of the street and
persuade investors that it can restore balance sheet strength and generate
the expected earnings and cash flow,  2) ENE must maintain its investment
grade credit rating, 3) ENE must successfully execute its divestiture
plans, and 4) ENE must control the timing of the recognition of the
write-down in the value of any assets whose market value is less than book.

IF ENE management does not step-up to calm investor fears, these fears
could become a self fulfilling prophecy.  In the potentially vicious cycle,
investor fears could drive the stock down, the lower stock prices force the
rating agencies to consider downgrades, potentially lower credit ratings
force counter-parties to reduce exposure with ENE, limiting ENE's to
generate earnings and cash flow.  Thus we see a big incentive for ENE to
clarify the issues.  We expect ENE to put together a more complete
explanation of the major issues over the next few days in order to
stabilize the stock.   If/when ENE schedules a conference call or road
show, we would consider this a bullish sign.  Absent further clarification,
the stock is likely to continue to be weak.   Our gut feel is that ENE can
pull it off and that long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually
the stock gets valued on earnings (with upside potential to $25+/sh over
the next 12 to 18 month period), rather than break-up value ($16/sh-see
below).  We believe new money (with high risk tolerance!) should wait until
ENE announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery.

ENE's VIEW:  ENE has stated that it has reviewed its asset base with Arthur
Anderson and that no additional asset impairments are required other than
an approximate $200 MM charge expected in 1Q02 due to an accounting change.
With no further asset write-downs, and roughly $890 MM in asset
divestitures ($390 MM India E&P, $250 MM Puerto Rico power plant, and $250
MM Brazilian power plant) in 4Q01, ENE's D/TC ratio is likely to decline
from 50% at the end of 3Q01 to roughly 48% at the end of the year.  After
the close of the Portland General divestiture, expected by year-end 2002,
we expect its D/TC to fall below 45% (we are projecting FCF to be
break-even in FY02).  We estimate that ENE's interest coverage at the end
of 3Q01 is 3.5x.  ENE is currently rated BBB+ by S&P and Baa1 by Moodys,
and would need to decline 3 ratings to fall below investment grade.  For
comparison purposes, S&P's BBB median D/TC is 47.4% and EBITDA/Int. Exp.
coverage is 6.1x, while BB (non-investment grade) median D/TC is 61.3% and
interest coverage is 3.8x.

IMPORTANCE OF ENE's INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING:  We believe that ENE's
Wholesale segments, which generates 80% of its EBIT, would be
noncompetitive if the credit rating falls below investment grade.  In
addition, a decline in credit rating below investment grade would trigger
the issuance of 50 MM shares of common stock and $1 B in convertible
preferred stock associated with ENE's off-balance sheet structured
financing vehicles.  We believe ENE will do what ever it can to maintain an

investment grade rating.  Moodys has its BBB+ rating under review for a
possible downgrade.   Last night S&P revised its long-term ratings outlook
to negative due to concerns that the significant drop in market
capitalization in the past week has adversely affected the company's
financial flexibility and could impede its ability to pursue plans to
rebuild its balance sheet.

BREAK-UP VALUE:  We believe ENE 's Wholesale America ($2.7 B in TTM
EBITDA), Wholesale Europe ($900 MM) and Retail ($450 MM) segments are
conservatively worth a 4x multiple (recent multiples have been higher, but
we are discounting due to limited buying interest) or $16.2 B.  The Gas
Pipeline segment ($820 MM) and Global Assets ($200 MM) valued at a 6x
multiple are worth $6.1 B.  PGE valued at the divestiture price is $2.9 B.
Total asset value is conservatively $25 B, vs. debt of $13 B, leaving $12 B
or $16/sh for equity investors in a break-up scenario.  The challenge is,
if ENE loses its investment grade rating, the value ($16.2 B) of its
Wholesale and Retail segments would be materially compromised--leaving
little for equity investors.

POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS:  ENE's Global Assets portfolio
includes assets with $6 B in book value (ENE's total gross PP&E is $14 B)
that has generated an EBIT loss of $18 MM (EBITDA of +$168 MM) over the
last 12-month period (4Q00 to 3Q01).  The Global Assets portfolio includes
Elektro (an electric utility in Brazil), Dabhol (power plant in India), TGS
(a natural gas pipeline in Argentina), Azurix and Enron Wind operations.
These assets seem ripe for a write-down although the company argues that it
has reviewed them with Arthur Anderson recently and that the assets are not
impaired.  ENE will have to continue to convince Anderson that the value of
these assets has not been impaired.  The write-down of these assets would
reduce shareholder equity and ENE's D/TC, threatening its credit rating.
It is not clear that ENE put all its under-performing assets in the Global
Assets portfolio.  There could be other poor performing assets in other
segments that are hidden by strong performance in its Wholesale business.

ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS:  ENE's counter-parties seem to be supportive and
have not indicated any change in business activity.  EnronOnline trading
volume was slightly above average yesterday.  Some energy traders have
bought ENE in their personal accounts, convinced that ENE core marketing
business is strong and the belief that the equity markets have
over-reacted.  Lots of ENE corporate finance people are working late nights
solidifying ENE's financial strategy (hopefully for a more complete
discussion with the street?).

THE SEC INQUIRY:  We believe ENE has an extensive paper trail from its
attorneys and accountants that will clear them of any legal problems with
the SEC associated with the LJM partnerships in which CFO Andy Fastow
participated.  We do not expect the SEC to find any legal
wrong-doing--although this doesn't mean that they won't express qualitative
concern over the appearance of the transactions.

"ICAP Supplier UCAP and LSE UCAP Requirements","
JCharlton@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Attachment A of the Stage 2 ICAP Manual, as posted, states that on
September 28, 2001 the NYISO will inform ICAP Suppliers of the amount of
Unforced Capacity they are qualified to offer in the 2001-2002 Winter
Capability Period. It also states that LSEs will be notified of the final
Unforced Capacity requirements (""UCR"") for the upcoming Obligation
Procurement Period.  Neither statement is correct and a revised Timeline is
available for comment. It will be discussed and finalized at the next ICAP
Working Group Meeting on October 5.  After that October 5 meeting, the
updated and corrected Timeline will be posted for approval at the October
25 BIC Meeting.

Providing firm final ICAP Supplier UCAP values or LSE UCRs was never
feasible in this timeframe.  Preliminary LSE UCRs for November were
provided to all LSEs on September 21.  Final LSE UCRs will be provided on
October 9.

ICAP Suppliers can estimate their UCAP value based information already
supplied. All ICAP Suppliers will have a firm UCAP value for November prior
to October 9, if there are no problems with the data submitted and in time
to participate in the Monthly Auction to be conducted on October 11. In the
meantime, Suppliers can offer as much or as little UCAP for the Winter
Capability Period strip auction as they expect to have available,
recognizing that their EFORd values will be updated monthly during the
Capability Period.  Recognize also that there will continue to be Monthly
and Deficiency auctions conducted each month during the Capability Period,
allowing any Supplier or LSE to clear any long or short postions.

"New Legal Team to Assist RAC","	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

Subject:	Update on RTOs -- Today's FERC meeting

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing ""certainty"" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

"Enron and United Way's Continued Partnership","
Last month all of your donations helped Enron raise a grand total of $6 million for the United Way, including our corporate match.  Once again Enron employees made a difference and contributed more than any other pacesetter company in Houston. Also, congratulations to Elaine Brown with Enron Global Markets who won the drawing for two round-trip airline tickets for participating in this year's campaign.  Thanks to everyone at Enron for your generosity!

This week Enron and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership. Beginning with the Astros vs Giants game on Tuesday, October 2, one of Enron's primary signs at Enron Field will feature the United Way logo alongside the Enron logo.

The decision to include United Way's logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in-stadium signage locations with a non-profit partner.  This sign is also a free, innovative way to demonstrate Enron's support of the United Way and promote the agency's role in our community.

The millions of fans who attend Astros games each season will see the sign.  Be sure to look for this history-making sign hanging high above the outfield.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility.

Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars.  

Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.

EWS Business Analysis and Reporting
Enron Wholesale Services (excluding Net Works) has nearly 1350 invoices totaling almost $12 million waiting for coding and approval in the iPayit system.  Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. 

Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days:

ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million
EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million
EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262,000
EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123,000 

If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox.  

We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.

If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com. 


IN THE NEWS    

Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8

Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13.

California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand.

``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy
Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy).  The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented:

- Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, 
- Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry
- All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections.

The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets.

 ""This is the first time one of our Italian asset development projects has moved forward since our jointly-owned Sarlux IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) plant in Sardinia went into full commercial operation in December 2000,"" says Ross Sankey who is leading Enron's Cadeo project team.  ""We're pleased to have identified such a suitable site for a new power plant and continue to assess other similar opportunities.""

GasMarktFax Stirs ""Trouble"" in German Incumbent-dominated Gas Market
Following on from a recent GlobalFlash! report on the launch of GasMarktFax by the German origination team we are pleased to provide the following update on the impact the product is beginning to have on the German gas market:  

European Spot Gas Markets reported on Thursday, 13 September, that Ruhrgas will decrease prices for their Stadtwerke and regional gas companies as of 1 October.  The article mentions that it is clear that Ruhrgas is taking competition seriously and that last month's release of Enron's GasMarktFax provided Stadtwerke with the opportunity to compare their standard price to Enron offers.  ""Pricing pressure pushes incumbents to lower their tariffs,"" said Helge-Jurgen Beil, director with the German origination team, who lead the GasMarktFax initiative.  ""However, it is important to note that incumbents try to crowd out marginal supplies and abuse their dominant supplier position.  Grid access is still cumbersome and only very few customers have a real choice,"" Helge-Jurgen added.

Enron Signs First Trading Deal in Poland
Enron's Polish team have signed the company's first ever trading deal in the country - which is also the first transaction entered into by a Polish power trading company based on the EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) Master Trading Agreement.

The 50MW deal is with PKE, currently Poland's largest generator by installed capacity, responsible for around 17% of total energy production in Poland.

The deal with PKE is effectively a series of 51 call options, each one of them being a separate option for 50MW of baseload power for any given calendar month. Enron is the buyer of this series of options. The first month for which Enron will have a call option will be October 2001, and the last will be December 2005. The exercise date for each option is 26 days before the beginning of the delivery month. The strike prices follow a pre-determined schedule.

""This pioneering agreement sets new standards of power trading in Poland,"" declares Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland.

""This deal has set a precedent and created a platform for us to further break into the bilateral wholesale electricity trading market in Poland,"" adds Jarek Astramowicz, Enron's vice-president and head of the Polish office.  A big thank you to Jarek Dybowski, Tomasz Krzyzewski, Sid Cox, Marcus Zwinger, Pat Cini and Jason Clatworthy and all the others who helped make this deal possible.""

EBS Celebrates Neos Deal
Congratulations to EBS who secured a deal with Neos, a company that specialises in providing bandwidth within London and other UK cities (known as metro connectivity). The transaction gives Enron instant access to London's metro network, which expands Enron's coverage. The agreement involves a  ?3 million take or pay commitment over ten years, with Enron receiving fixed prices and degradation for the capacity.
 
Marcello Romano, Vice President Bandwidth Trading, is delighted: ""We needed to close a strategic deal to increase our metro coverage. Not only has this been achieved but the team negotiated well below market prices.""

Launch of Nordic precipitation index
In another first for Enron, this week saw the launch by Enron Nordic Energy of a precipitation index based on rainfall levels in a number of locations.  The index will serve as a new weather trading instrument bringing more choice to the weather market and thereby promoting market liquidity.  Given the close relationship existing between precipitation levels and power prices in the Nordic region, the index will be of interest to both power traders and large hydro producers.  The index will serve as a new trading instrument enabling power traders to add to and refine their positions.  For the large hydro producers, the index will provide a benchmark for hedging their risk against fluctuations in rainfall.  The index will be based on a large number of locations available throughout the Nordic region, with 27 locations in all (19 in Norway and 8 in Sweden).

On the very day of the index launch, we were able to announce the completion of a deal with Norsk Hydro whereby we have constructed a specific index enabling Norsk Hydro to hedge its production volumes throughout the Nordic region.  

Given the amount of hydroproduction in the Nordic region - approximately 99% (116TWh/yr) in Norway and 50% (64TWh/yr) in Sweden - the index is likely to be of significant interest in the Nordic market.  In Norway and Sweden, about 70% of the supply side is hydro and the volume of this supply can deviate by around 10% from normal (and by up to 30% during extreme years).  The subsequent impact on prices is huge and the variation in produced volumes is of great concern to hydro producers.

LOST IN AMERICA ONLINE
All year long, leading media giant AOL Time Warner (NYSE: AOL)
had clung to its beefy annual projections that called for $40
billion in revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization) of $11 billion. While its old
media peers buckled under a soft ad market and some of its new
media peers bowed out completely, AOL Time Warner stood firm.

While we can all use a good massage about now, here's the rub:
Most of Steiner Leisure's (Nasdaq: STNR) spa services take place
afloat on cruise ships, and vacationers are putting off their
bon voyages. Steiner is now talking down third and fourth
quarter projections. The company, which also sells its own line
of spa products and runs a few massage schools, feels it has a
good grip on its long-term fundamentals. Unfortunately, the bad
news in the near term is sure to rub Wall Street the wrong way.

Flat is where it's at. Flat panel display maker Kopin (Nasdaq:
KOPN) bucked the trend by raising its third-quarter projections.
Strong demand for its III-V and CyberDisplay imaging devices has
the company expecting a 25% sequential increase in revenue and a
loss of $0.15 to $0.17 a share. That's on the low end of analyst
estimates.

Recession-resistant and sometimes even caffeine free, soda
investors can have a Coke (NYSE: KO) and a smile this morning as
the carbonated fizz giant is on target to meet its 2001 marks.
Thanks to robust consumption in the Asia and Africa markets the
company expects volume growth to come in between 4% and 5% this
year.

Free in flight, AMR (NYSE: AMR) Chariman Donald Carty announced
that he would forgo all compensation -- including his salary --
for the rest of the year. Given the troubled state of the
airline industry in general, and AMR's American Airlines in
particular, it's more a token gesture than a way to reverse the
company's possible billion-dollar shortfall this year.

There is no easy chair in the office furniture industry. With
sales falling 25% over the past year and orders off by a third,
Herman Miller (Nasdaq: MLHR) reported earnings before charges of
$0.04 a share. While that is in line with analyst projections,
it comes after the company had to talk down earnings twice.
Originally the company was expected to report profits of $0.40 a
share -- essentially what it had earned the year before. Herman
Miller also announced that it would be letting 2,600 employees
go, which poses the question: What will the company do with all
that office furniture?

This is great stuff..

Since Strategic sees the value in having this 'valuable' call option. I
would suggest that they value the put option on the load contracts being
served and rebate their customers accordingly.
Include the obvious DAM to R/T arbitrage as optionality also, the
options thay hold are hourly and therefore are much more valuable.

I look forward to the rebates being sent to their customers.

If a GT so valuable go buy one or build one.

"FW: Fleishman-EXC- Ratings Reduced on Lower Earnings","

 -----Original Message-----

Sent:	Thursday, September 27, 2001 11:24 AM
To:	Gualy, Jaime
Subject:	Fleishman-EXC- Ratings Reduced on Lower Earnings

EXC; $50.45; C-2-2-7
Reported EPS (Dec): 2000A $3.74; 2001E $4.35; 2002E $5.00
* We are lowering our investment rating on EXC to 2-2 from 1-1 on a reduced earnings outlook.
* EXC announced this morning that lower power prices and a weakening economy would cause earnings to fall below its $4.50/share target for 2001.  The new range is $4.30-$4.45.  Importantly, this number includes absorbing costs for increased severance and a telecom write-off.  For 2002, the company is not providing any outlook, but notes concern over economic weakness.
* While EXC?s earnings are somewhat protected from lower power prices with roughly 60-70% of its generation sold to its own retail customers, the other 30-40% is sold into the wholesale markets.  EXC?s low-cost nuclear plants insure that these sales are profitable, but the rapid decline in gas prices and associated drop in power prices will reduce these profits below expectations.
* In addition, EXC management is concerned about signs of weakening retail demand post the September 11 tragedy, particularly in Chicago.
* We are lowering our 2001E to $4.35/share to reflect these issues.  For 2002, EXC will still see a $0.43/share benefit from the elimination of goodwill amortization.  Moreover, we expect less one-time items and losses at Enterprises and cost cuts at distribution to help earnings.  However, we now assume mid-to-high $20 prices for wholesale and only modest retail growth (1%).  Our new 2002E number is now $5.00/share.
* Our lower rating reflects less conviction on earnings and concern over how EXC can implement its strategic consolidation plan with a lower stock currency.  However, the stock trades at only 10x our reduced earnings outlook and the company remains a low-cost producer with a significant retail hedge.  Once the dust settles, we expect the stock to return to an average group multiple of around 9x, implying a mid $40s stock price.

"HQ - NO CHANGE IN POWER MARKET STRATEGY","
12:23 18Sep2001 RSF-Hydro-Quebec says no change of strategy in US trade

    QUEBEC CITY, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Hydro-Quebec said on Tuesday it had been staying out of the U.S. power market over the past few weeks because of mild weather and not because it was reevaluating its trade strategy as some traders suggested this week.
    ""There is no change in our sales strategy. There is nothing extraordinary there as the weather has been mild and the month of September is more quiet this year,"" said Hydro-Quebec spokeswoman Claudine Aucuit.
    Hydro-Quebec, North America's largest power producer, has sold very little power to the United States. since Aug. 31, when its long-term contracts with New England utilities expired.
    Some traders said the most interesting occurrence this week has been Hydro-Quebec's lack of participation in the New York and New England markets and that the Canadian utility's traders may have pulled back to evaluate their positions now that long-term contracts have expired.
    Other traders said they believed Hydro-Quebec is conserving water for this winter because of a drought in parts of Canada.
    Hydro-Quebec denied all these rumors.
    ""We are less present but there is no policy change,"" Hydro-Quebec's Aucuit told Reuters.

market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants

1st Rochdale Cooperative. Ltd. is being removed from the
NYISO-administered electric energy markets.  The changeover
of 1st Rochdale's customers to the provider of last resort,
Consolidated Edison Company of New York, will take place on
Friday, October 12 for the Saturday, October 13th market.
1st Rochdale had previously posted a sufficient amount of
collateral to cover its obligations to the energy market and
the NYISO anticipates, therefore, that no losses associated
with this transition will be borne by the market.

Regards,
Customer Relations

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel


RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Here's some good stock advice I recently received.  
If you bought $1000 worth of Nortel stock one year ago,  
it would now be worth $49. If you bought $1000 worth  
of Budweiser (the beer, not the stock) one year ago,  
drank all the beer, and traded in the cans for the  
nickel deposit, you would have $79.  
My advice to you is to live in a state with bottle deposits and start  
drinking heavily.

"RE:  Sept. 24 ICAPWG Mtg","
""Kirkpatrick, Joe"" <joe.kirkpatrick@nrgenergy.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

The example contained in the presentation with regard to the cost of
ICAP to Customers is while sound in theory contains misleading and
totally inaccurate information with regard to the cost of a GT.

The capital cost of the GT in the example is $2.5 M for a 25 MW GT or
$100 per KW. If the author can build GTs in NYC for $100 per KW then
please contact us and we will secure your services.

I can cite NYPA's investment of well over $500 million for 450 MW for a
cost of $1100 per KW.

The cost to build GTs in NYC are closer to $1000/KW or 10 times the
value represented in the example.
The O&M costs are also at some sort of serious discount to reality.

If examples are to be cited then let's get them closer to the real
world.

"Opportunity","Ben,

I was again good to talk with you and I look forward to the
possibilities. As we spoke of, Joe Toussaint is heading up the talent
initiative and coordinating the recruiting process. I spoke with Joe
today and he informed me he had left several contact numbers for you so
I will at this point step out of the middle of process to allow for a
more coordinated approach. I'm sure I speak for Joe when I say we
believe the changes in the industry as well as Enron provide opportunity
for us both.

Please provide Joe with your resume as soon as you can and as we
discussed be prepared to discuss your desires, skills and/or experiences
you believe uniquely qualify you, as well as examples of your ability to
create value.

Again it has been my pleasure and I'm sure Joe or his designee will
contact you concerning your trip to Cincinnati and scheduled activities
next week.

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of ""icap"" as a product (including any ""reserve type"" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on ""Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets.""

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

"Out-of-Merit","From time to time there have been discussions in the TIE list criticizing
Con Edison for its involvement in out-of-merit actions, implying that it is
inappropriate for Con Edison control room operators to make such requests.
In its recent order on the Revised Local Mitigation Measures, FERC, in
response to allegations made by Orion, ordered the NYISO to take
responsibility for out-of-merit.

The Con Edison system has the world's most concentrated use of energy for
residential and commercial purposes. It is also a highly
transmission-constrained area where transfer limitations under normal and
second contingency conditions require certain minimum generation levels
within specific load pockets to assure reliability under existing
reliability rules. One of the main functions of the Con Edison control
center is to be vigilant of system conditions at all times and prevent the
system from reaching an unreliable operating state. When such conditions are
imminent, the Con Edison operator so advises the NYISO. Some parties have
said that Con Edison operators should never make out-of-merit requests. Con
Edison operators would be acting irresponsibly if they were to detect an
imminent unreliable operating condition and just sit back and not inform the
NYISO of the potential danger. Con Edison operators have been trained to
focus on operating the New York City system. The NYISO operators have a much
wider state-wide focus. It is entirely appropriate for both a transmission
owner (TO) and NYISO operators to work cooperatively in maintaining
reliability with the clear understanding that under the FERC-approved
tariff, it is the NYISO that has sole responsibility for reliability. I
would like to clarify that all involvement by Con Edison operators in
out-of-merit actions are based on the following  FERC-approved process in
which the NYISO, and not the TO operator, has sole responsibility for these
actions.

	The NYISO FERC Electric Tariff, Section 5.4,  Operations Under
Adverse Conditions states in essence that:
		*	The NYISO shall operate the system in accordance
with Reliability Rules, including local rules
		*	The NYISO will do this, among other measures, by
adjusting generator output levels
		*	The NYISO has sole responsibility for declaring that
Adverse Conditions are imminent
		*	Activation of these actions shall involve a two-step
process
			1.	The TO involved will advise the NYISO that
an Adverse Condition is imminent and recommend action
			2.	The NYISO activates the appropriate
procedures
		*	Records of the activation of such procedures shall
be maintained by both the TO and the NYISO

Having stated the above, let me also say that Con Edison has been working
with NYISO operations to minimize the occurrences of conditions that require
Con Edison operators to request actions that result in OOM operations. Con
Edison supports current efforts by the NYISO to manage load pocket
reliability events in a way that SCD can be used to maintain reliability
with in-merit generation.

In effect, the FERC recent order does not require any change from present
practice which is, and has always been, in compliance with Section 5.4 of
the NYISO FERC Electric Tariff, and in compliance with FERC's recent order:
the NYISO is solely responsible for out-of-merit actions.

Here's what some of you had to say.   To see the original article, The B-School Decision, go here.    ...  I just wanted to point out that there are a few aspects of seeking an  MBA that you neglected to mention in your ""B-School Decision"" article.   I am a 15 year IT veteran who returned to school to obtain an MBA in  Technology Management from The University of Phoenix Online in 1997.  I took a one year break for the birth of each of my two dughters, but am  finally about to finish. I've been around long enough to know that an  MBA is not an instant ticket to fame and fortune, but I also know that  an MBA can pay off, even if you aren't planning to look for a new job  as soon as you graduate.     First, employers are often highly supportive of employees who wish to  return to school to obtain advanced degrees.  Many employers will pay  anywhere from half of tuition up to the entire amount of the degree,  plus books and lab fees.  With incentives like that, the FIRST place  you should look in financing a degree is with your current employer.   Some employers seek a contractual obligation that you will stay with  them after you graduate, but even with this clause, if you are set on  leaving you should still be able to leverage a better salary or  position for the stay.  Another option would be to negotiate with your  prospective employer to pay part of the obligation to your past  employer.  It's a long shot, but worth a try.    Another thing you neglected to mention is that many schools now have  programs that are geared to adult, full-time employees.  I chose the  University of Pheonix specifically for this reason.  Class in the  evening or, better yet, online, allow the student to return to school  with a minimal impact on work.  Sure, an online degree is not an MBA  from Harvard (yet), but an MBA from a school like UOPHX is still an MBA and, unlike the small college down the street, UOPHX is pumping out  enough MBA graduates on a national level to at least be recognized by  employers.     And lastly, when considering whether to obtain an MBA, you have to  consider the cost of NOT pursueing one.  As you get older, credentials  are not as important as experience, but most employers have bought into the idea that learning is a life-long activity and they look favorably  on anyone who demonstrates that they want to keep learning, regardless  of their age or position.  And the percentage of employees who are  seeking some kind of certification or degree is increasing all the  time. The truth is, if you are not making some effort to continue your  education in some form, chances are you are at a disadvantage to those  who are when promotion time comes.     ...   I thought that the MBA article made a good point: don't go back to school simply to ""hide out"".    The article however failed higher education in a major way by mostly presenting a short term cost benefit analysis. The most important benefit of a graduate level education is the development of the cognitive abilities of the student. This accomplishment is opens then mind, last a life time, and can positively affect many generations within the graduate's family.    While financial factors are reality and should be considered carefully, they should not be the primary deciding factor when determining whether or not to obtain a graduate degree. I hope that you did not discourage too many people with your article.   ...  I enjoyed your article on making the B school decision.  I was one that decided not to do it several years ago.  Mainly because I did not see where the curriculum really prepared you for practicing management in the real world.  (My undergraduate degree was in Business Administration).   More importantly, proven experience almost always out weighs the MBA.  I consistently volunteered for projects at work and always tried to continuously improve myself and the organization.  This led to me becoming a Vice President by age 34.   My recommendation is if you need the knowledge of how businesses work, look into an MBA but realize practicing management is much more powerful than studying it.  An MBA will not teach taking risk, overcoming adversity, resiliency and making decisions that has powerful impacts on people.  Those can only be learned through the school of hard knocks.

Hence, we bring you the results of a Vault survey on employer perceptions of an online education.   Vault surveyed 239 HR professionals on their opinions regarding candidates with online degrees.     The following are the results from the survey:   30% of HR professionals or hiring managers have encountered applicants with online degrees.   Selected quotes: - ""The candidates that I've spoken with seem to be self-dependent, eager and very abreast of the latest technologically."" - ""I still view this as close to the equivalent of earning a GED through a Sally Struthers correspondence course."" - ""There may be some value to online degrees, but in order for them to be truly worthwhile, they need to overcome the stigma of being just another 'degree mill' or correspondence course advertising on matchbooks."" - ""I usually like these candidates more than those from traditional universities;  most of them have been working in the industry and have some years of experience and accomplishments to their credit.""  77% of HR professionals or hiring managers believe that an online degree earned at an accredited institution (Duke, Stanford) is more credible than one earned at an Internet only institution (Jones International).

EPS Visibility Has Blurred, but Not Much has Changed

* 3 negative pre-announcements in 2 days blurs EPS visibility
We are examining where the weakness has stemmed from - (1)
smaller, regionally-focused businesses (EXC) and (2) aggressive
power price forecasts (AES & RRI).
* Some companies have reaffirmed '01 and even '02 EPS guidance
DUK, ETR, ILA, MIR, NRG, PPL & SRE have reaffirmed 2001
EPS guidance. ETR and MIR have also reaffirmed 2002 EPS
guidance. Informally reaffirmed - CPN, D, MIR, PEG & TXU.
* Trading, CA generation and peaking plant income appear most volatile
Inside we try to identify stocks with exposure to these businesses
and quantify what percentage of our estimates they represent.
* Believe EPS downside risk should be limited to 15%
Both CEG and RRI missed estimates by roughly this amount.
RRI also reduced its growth rate to 15% - we have always
assumed long-term growth rates would come down to 15-20%.
* Reduced EPS expectations are already priced into stocks
Group multiple is roughly 9X, with some stocks at 7X P/E
multiples - implying 0.4-0.6X PEG ratios. This valuation
appears too heavily discounted for 15% EPS downside risk.

FCiani@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants,

Software changes originally scheduled for September 25, 2001 have been
delayed.  Quality Assurance testing discovered problems which need to be
repaired and retested.

The deployment of BEA's WebLogic application server will be delayed until
October 16, 2001. This server will be the platform utilized by the MIS to
provide bidding and scheduling functions.  It will replace the current
NetDynamics product and will be a more robust and reliable development
platform for future enhancements.

New data postings will be available on the web to provide real-time
internal
transmission limits and flows.  Transmission line scheduled and actual
outages
will also be posted.  These postings are a continuation of the data
requests
made by the Business Issues Committee (BIC) in September 2000.


If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

You are invited to attend the 3rd Annual Urban Business Initiative Volunteer
Kickoff on Wednesday, September 26, 2001 at Slainte Irish Pub (509 Main
Street) at 6:00 p.m.

The Urban Business Initiative is a group of young professional volunteers
who are committed to the economic revitalization of Houston's inner city.
UBI was founded by a group of Enron analysts in 1996, and has since grown to
include volunteers from more than 15 corporations in Houston.

UBI volunteers work on consulting teams with small business owners and
entrepreneurs in Houston's inner city on projects such as developing
business and marketing plans, conducting financial analyses, and providing
technology assessments.  They also develop and conduct business education
seminars to promote business literacy in Houston.

Please join us if you would like to learn more about the Urban Business
Initiative and the impact we are having on Houston's inner-city businesses.

                    AM                   Subject:     DYN($42/sh)/ENE
($7/sh) Merger At
                                          Risk.




SUMMARY:  We are reducing our estimated probability that the DYN/ENE merger
is completed to less than 50%/50% based on our belief that ENE's existing
wholesale and retail businesses are having a difficult time maintaining
their volumes and margins.  We have discussed ENE's need to improve counter
party confidence on a number of occasions over the last few weeks, and we
believe counter party confidence deteriorated further based on the
information included in the 10Q, and the strong negative reaction in the
stock and bond markets yesterday.  The tone of our discussions with
competing traders and marketers (representative of ENE's counter
parties--which are critical in maintaining ENE's volumes) is becoming more
negative.  While ENE is continuing to confirm that volumes are improving
since the lows on November 9, our market intelligence is suggesting
improment has stalled.  In addition and probably related, ENE's liquidity
position seems to be continuing to deteriorate despite significant recent
capital infusions.  We are reducing 4Q01 estimates to reflect lower volume
and margin assumptions.  What would get us more comfortable?  ENE 8K
disclosure confirming higher volume and decent margins (ENE has committed
to provide 4Q guidance by early-mid December, and/or a change in the tone
of the counter parties that would suggest they are increasing trading
activities with ENE.

OPINION ON THE STOCKS:
   ENE.  No change in our opinion on ENE--the upside potential is simply
   not worth the downside risk.
   DYN.  DYN is likely to benefit in almost all outcomes.  If our concerns
   about counter party confidence prove to be wrong, the upside associated
   with the accretion in the transaction would likely be huge.  However, we
   sense DYN is getting frustrated by continued restatement of earnings,
   unexpected debt triggers and worse than expected liquidity problems.  If
   the transaction falls apart, DYN would have some transaction costs that
   would negatively impact cash flow in the near-term, but DYN would
   benefit from gaining market share and hiring some of ENE's talent away
   longer term.  A potential downside case for DYN is that DYN retrades the
   deal on recent information, but is forced to reduced its flexibility to
   terminate the transaction through material adverse change
   considerations, this out come would concern us.  We continue to believe
   DYN is a solid long-term holding for investors.  However, we are
   recommending caution with new money, due to our belief that DYN still
   has $5/sh to $7/sh of ""deal"" premium factored into the current stock
   price which could be at risk if the deal fails.  We do not believe DYN
   has significant accounts receivable exposure to ENE in the event the ENE
   has further liquidity problems (we believe DYN's trading agreement with
   ENE limits exposure to maybe $100 to $150 MM).

COUNTER PARTY INCENTIVES:  ENE identified in its 10Q that transaction
volume (especially long-term transactions) have declined since the 3Q.  If
you are a utility or industrial customer, why enter into a long-term
transaction with ENE?  Why not go directly to DYN or diversify with other
suppliers?  If you are a natural gas or power producer, why create the
account receivable risk?  If you are a counter party, strategically why
would you contribute to the continuation of the ENE machine--to the
ultimate benefit of strengthening another competitor (DYN)?  We believe
that ENE is offering attractive financial incentives (premium purchases
and/or discounted sales) to entice counter parties to trade with them.
However, this would also suggest ENE margins may be getting squeezed.

EPS ESTIMATES (new/old/consensus):
   4Q01-$0.20/0.35/0.42, FY01-$1.55/1.70/1.78, FY02-$1.50/1.50/1.90
   We are reducing expectations for margins in the Wholesale segment from
   9cts/mmbtu to 7cts/mmbtu--negatively impacting 4Q EPS by 10cts/sh.  In
   addition, we expect contributions from Enron Energy Services will be
   lower due to challenges in closing long-term transactions (much of EES's
   earnings are mark-to-market recognition of the value created in
   long-term agreeements) impacting our estimate by 5cts/sh.

=================================================================
YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED


Q. JUST WHAT IS A HOSTILE TAKEOVER?

A. Well, a friendly takeover involves one company agreeing to be
bought by another. Managers from each firm will typically meet
with each other and freely share information about themselves.
As you might imagine, in a hostile takeover, the acquisition
target is not too thrilled or cooperative.

In a hostile takeover, a would-be acquirer typically sees some
strategic value in another company. It may make friendly
overtures and be rebuffed. If so, it may then move on to dealing
directly with the target's shareholders, by offering to buy
their shares from them for either a certain amount in cash, or
an exchange of stock. If enough shareholders respond, the
acquirer can gain control. In order to entice shareholders, the
offer will certainly be for a price significantly higher than
the target's current stock price. Note that companies whose
share prices have slumped are extra-vulnerable to takeovers.

Some high-profile hostile takeover bids have included IBM for
Lotus, Johnson & Johnson for Cordis, and Hilton for ITT.

Q. IS A STRONG DOLLAR GOOD OR BAD FOR STOCKS?

A. A strong dollar can cause trouble for companies with
extensive international operations, such as Procter & Gamble or
McDonald's. That's because they'll get fewer dollars for their
rubles and pesos and francs when they exchange currency -- and
fewer dollars means lower earnings.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
THIS WEEK'S LESSON

THE HIGH COST OF SMOKING
It might seem strange to see an article on quitting smoking in a
financial feature. But in many ways, smoking is a very financial enterprise.

For example, companies obviously profit from the tobacco business.
We're also used to hearing about all the health risks associated with
smoking -- such as the fact that smoking accounts for at least
30 percent of all cancer deaths (according to the American
Cancer Society, at cancer.org). The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention estimate that health care expenditures caused
directly by smoking totaled $50 billion in 1993, $10 billion
paid by Medicare.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=518563

A more Foolish way to address the cost of smoking, though, is to
examine its immediate price tag. Imagine that you're 35 years old,
you smoke one pack a day, and each pack costs you, on average, about
$3. Multiply $3 by 365 days, and you're looking at an annual cost of
$1,095. Let's see what would happen if you took this $1,095 and
invested it in the stock market, earning the historical average
return of 11 percent per year. In 30 years, you'd have $25,067.
If you invested $1,095 in the market *each year* for 30 years,
you'd end up with a whopping $241,900. Yowza.

Those who would like to quit should know that there are more
resources available to you today than ever before, most notably online.
For example, we recently opened a ""Quitting Smoking"" discussion
board. In less than a year, it's received roughly 8,000 posts from
people who have quit or are interested in quitting. These folks are
continually supporting and encouraging each other, and many end
their posts with this unique kind of signature: ""Matt. Two days,
4 hours, 23 minutes and 19 seconds. 43 cigarettes not smoked,
saving $7.09. Life saved: 3 hours, 35 minutes."" And ""Helen. Eight
months,two days, 16 hours, 41 minutes and 10 seconds. 9,867 cigarettes
not smoked, saving $1,480.17. Life saved: 4 weeks, 6 days,
6 hours, 15 minutes.""

KIMBERLY-CLARK OFF THE MARK
Grab a Kleenex, folks. Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) announced that
it would be missing its quarterly mark. While its preliminary
third-quarter take has revenue climbing by 5% over last year, it
now expects operating earnings per share to come in at just
$0.80 a share. That's off last year's $0.84 a share showing and
a nickel below Wall Street's estimates.

NEWS TO GO
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to find out what The Rock is cooking this weekend,
you'll need more than DirecTV. After sparring over how to split
up pay-per-view revenue since their contract expired earlier
this year, World Wrestling Federation (NYSE: WWF) and the
Hughes' (NYSE: GMH) owned DirecTV have decided to part ways.
Starting with Sunday night's No Mercy presentation, the
wrestling performance will not be made available to DirecTV
subscribers.

In a New York minute, Central Parking's (NYSE: CPC) earnings
outlook can change. The parking lot operator, which has been an
aggressive consolidator in its fragmented sector, has felt the
pinch of empty parking spaces since last month's terrorist
attacks. The company, which oversees 1.5 million parking spaces
worldwide, is looking at fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per
share to come in between a dime and $0.14. The analysts --
following the company as closely as a mall driver behind someone
heading out of the stores -- were expecting the September
quarter results to come in closer to $0.21 a share.

When you're a semiconductor production equipment maker, the
bright side is often a paler shade of gray. Novellus Systerms
(NVLS) announced quarterly bookings of just $124 million, well
below its summer forecasts of $160 million, yet still managed to
meet analyst targets of $0.24 in earnings per share. While
proclaiming weakness in every region and thinner gross margins,
Novellus is comfortable with fourth-quarter projections given
its cost-shaving strategy. While the company has implemented
salary cuts it is one of the few tech players to have skirted
the layoff process.

One is the loneliest number, and B2B's fallen hero Commerce One
(Nasdaq: CMRC) is getting closer to that number in terms of
headcount. The e-commerce software specialist will be cutting
its payroll by 1300 employees -- 46% of its workforce. Seven
hundred of those will be laid off while another 600 will be part
of the company's attempt to spin-off some of its service
operations. With minority shareholder SAP announcing that it has
no intentions of swallowing the 80% of the company it does not
presently own, Commerce One's mounting losses are troubling for
the company as an independent.

Pro-forma profits have been cut in half but Unisys (NYSE: UIS)
marches on. The e-business solutions provider met Wall Street's
reduced $0.07 a share profit number -- a figure which was as
high as $0.18 a share just last month. Backing out currency
fluctuations, revenue came in essentially flat from year-ago
levels. Recognizing its deteriorating margin levels, the company
will be aggressively cutting costs in the current quarter. The
move will include doing away with 3,000 jobs.

POST OF THE DAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

MY BERKSHIRE
""I bought my first Berkshire shares a few years ago with the
money that my grandmother left me in her will. The money that
was left over paid my exam fees for the toughest Actuarial exam
you can take in England. Those Berkshire shares will NEVER be
sold. I may end up on skid row, I may end up being dragged
through the courts, who knows. But those shares will NEVER be
sold. They will have to prized from my cold dead hands. That
certificate is one of my most prized possessions.""

"ICAP/UCAP  forms","
Dear Market Participant,

In the interest of not flooding the webmaster with constant changes (new
PTIDs or new participant names) to the
UCAP forms (Certification, Bid Forms, and Offer Forms), I will be updating
the forms about once per month.  Since you will
need a methodology to work around missing information, the new forms have
codes that will allow you to enter
undefined PTIDs and undefined new participants.

PTID number 999999 is used for a resource that has not been assigned a
number.
NewLSE is used for a new Load Serving Entity that has not been assigned a
""Registrant Name""
NewSuppl is used for a new Supplier that has not been assigned a
""Registrant Name""

NOTE that if you use any of the above, you must describe your intentions in
the comments cell of the form being submitted.

Other Changes

ISOSu is the prefix for sales or purchases that occurred as a result of
NYISO transactions during the supplemental
process.  The supplemental process is implemented when there is
insufficient UCAP available within a location and
the NYISO must purchase UCAP from outside the location where the shortage
has occurred to meet the NYCA reliability requirements.

PTID numbers to be used when identifying UCAP purchased through the NYISO
auction have been assigned.  The PTID
numbers range from 1 to 38 and are related to auctions or the supplemental
processes.   For example, a participant who is
selling UCAP that was previously purchased in the summer strip auction
would enter PTID number 1 on the Offer form when
selling into a subsequent ISO auction.

A list of PTID numbers is now available on the instruction page of the
auction Offer forms.



Reminder

When identifying an ISO auction, please remember that you must think in
terms of the procurement period for the first auction
month when the transaction took place.  For example, on May 15 (the auction
for the upcoming months of June through October)
3MW were transacted for the months of June and August.  The auction
reference that you will use for both the June and
August transactions are ISOMoJun.  The same auction reference would be used
if on May 15, the transactions were for
August and September.

When completing the Certification Form, do not net transactions.  Lets say
that you are awarded 25 MW from the Strip
Auction and later move (purchase or sell) 5 MW through a bilateral.  Your
entries on the form would show the 25 MW strip
auction transaction on one line and your second line would show the 5 MW
bilateral transaction.  You can not use a
value of 20MW on one line.

Each and Every Month you must submit your certification form.



Regards,
Bob Boyle

"Re:","
Hey Bro,

Yeah, I got the email from a couple of sources.  Good looking kid.  Yes, we
are getting old but I still like to get drunk and act like an idiot.  I
guess we will never grow out of that.  Last week was bitch but I think it
put everybody back into reality.  I think there will be some good out of
this.  Even though the economy will go into recession, people aren't caring
about money some much anymore.  The recession won't bring people down as
they realize their own mortality.  The recession will end quickly as soon
as Americans can get a sense of security again.  I am just going to sit
tight on my loser stocks.  There will be a huge rally in about a year.
This is going to instill a greater feeling of freedom and capitalism in the
young generation (God I am old for saying that) that we don't have.

Weird things are happenning in DC.   They must have credible evidence of
another possible attack this Saturday.  A battallion of US Army troops are
on there way up to DC from Ft. Bragg, NC.  They are only saying it is for
""added security"".  I plan on staying home Saturday and working on my house.
Keep an eye out for your self Saturday.

"NYISO - Software Release - October 30, 2001","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants,

The following software updates will become active on October 30, 2001.

The NYISO web infrastructure will be enhanced through the
implementation of BEA's WebLogic product. The new application
server will be the platform utilized by the MIS to provide
bidding and scheduling capability to Internet customers. The
new software replaces the NetDynamics product, will provide
the same functionality, and will be a more robust and reliable
development platform for future enhancements.

Enhancements will be made to the software that generates the
Pre-MGF (Master Generator File) file used by transmission owners
in the event of a Backup Dispatch System (BDS) activation. The
enhancements will ensure more accurate operation of the BDS system.

The NYISO web page will be modified to add a ticker function
that displays the real-time load information.

Multiple preliminary software changes will be made to the MIS,
SPIDER, and BAS systems in preparation for the activation of
Virtual Bidding in the NYISO energy markets on November 1, 2001.
Activation of Virtual Bidding is pending approval by the FERC.


If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representatve
or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

"ICAP Announcement - Revision to Con Edison Transmission District UCAP Requirement","
ADesell@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Due to the terrorist actions in NYC which collapsed offices in the World
Trade
   Center complex and reduced customer Load in that Transmission District,
   the
   ISO is re-calculating the Unforced Capacity (""UCAP"") requirement for the
   Consolidated Edison Transmission District (CETD) and the New York
   Control
   Area.  The new UCAP requirement for the CETD for the Capability Period
   11/1/01 to 4/31/02 is 12788 MW and the total UCAP requirement for the
   New York Control Area is 32892 MW.  Changes in the UCAP requirements
   of affected LSEs will be provided to them, individually, today.

   The table below provides a comparison of the revised UCAP requirements
   to those in effect prior to this revision.

"NYISO Statement On External ICAP from ISO-NE (Not a Draft)","
JCharlton@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:




JCharlton@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:




ISO-NE has a filing pending at FERC to eliminate their ability to recall
energy from Resources selling ICAP into NY.  If FERC approves the filing,
the ISO will accept up to 350 MW of ICAP from the ISO-NE control area,
subject to the maximum 2558 MW of Installed Capacity located outside the
NYCA in accordance with Attachment B of the Installed Capacity Manual.
Installed Capacity in this context will be in the form of the ICAP
equivalent of the qualified Unforced Capacity (UCAP) sold, consistent with
the ICAP equivalent calculations in Attachment J of the ICAP Manual.

ISO-NE has requested an effective date for its filing of October 22 so FERC
is not expected to approve the ISO-NE tariff changes before then. The next
ICAP Supplier and LSE certifications are due to the NYISO on October 23.
The deficiency auction is scheduled on October 25. In accordance with the
last paragraph of Section 4.9.3 of the ICAP Manual, the ISO plans to open
the period for requesting such rights at 8:00 a.m. on October 18 and close
the request period at 5:00 p.m on October 22. This request period is
conditioned on a timely approval of the elimination of
recall rights by ISO-NE.

Resources located in New England (as well as PJM or HQ) that want to
qualify as ICAP Suppliers in New York must comply with the equirements set
forth in Sections 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.9 of the ICAP Manual. The NYISO
encourages Resources to submit DMNC test results, Operating Data and other
required information as soon as possible to allow their participation in
the ICAP market if and when the Commission approves the elimination of the
recall procedures in New England.

"FW: Electric Utilities - Weekly Update","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	""Colangelo, Maria"" <Maria.Colangelo@ubsw.com>@ENRON   On Behalf Of ""Abramson, Barry"" <Barry.Abramson@ubsw.com>
Sent:	Monday, September 24, 2001 7:54 AM
To:	undisclosed-recipients:;@ENRON
Subject:	Electric Utilities - Weekly Update

KEY POINTS
This is our first Weekly Update since the terrorist attacks upon the United States last week.  We wish to express our
sympathy for all of the victims and their families.  We also want to express our appreciation for the heroic efforts of
all of the rescue workers who put themselves in danger in order to help others.

When the stock markets reopened this week, the utility stocks, in a broad sense, resumed their previous pattern of
trading.  Since August, the stocks of companies that have more of the characteristics of traditional utilities have
outperformed while the higher-growth electricity companies that are less regulated have been laggards.  These trends
continued last week.

Before September 11, the IPP stocks and the utilities with merchant generation, were losing value because of fundamental
concerns about lower wholesale power prices.  Also before September 11, the higher yielding, more traditional utilities
were gaining in value due to their defensive characteristics that were favored due to the slowing U.S. economy.

After September 11, it appears that investors driven by fear of the unknown and by greater concerns about a recession in
the U.S., have looked for safe havens in the higher yielding utility stocks.

Although higher yields are good for a portfolio in a period of market uncertainty, we think that the best values in the
electric group are in what we consider to be the over-sold merchant generating stocks, such as PPL Corp. (PPL-$37.00,
rated Strong Buy)[2], Duke Energy (DUK-$37.17, rated Strong Buy)[2] and NRG Energy (NRG-$15.50, rated Strong Buy).

We also favor a few of the seemingly over-sold diversified energy/convergence stocks, such as Dominion Resources
(D-$58.98, rated Strong Buy)[2] and NiSource (NI-$23.40, rated Strong Buy).

Dear Market Participants,

Administrative changes will be made to the MIS database to prepare for
future
Virtual Bidding development  These changes will have no noticeable effects
on
MIS performance or functionality, however, these changes will require a
short
MIS outage.  The outage will begin at approximately 11:35 on September 27,
2001
and last for 30 minutes.

If you have any questions, please call Customer Relations at 518-356-6060.

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Enron & FERC - Market Impact Overdone

* Enron credit position not a concern, in our view
Other energy merchants have credit mitigation & master netting
agreements. In any event, there is no evidence that ENE's credit
position is in serious jeopardy.
* Is Enron the market proxy?
We don't think so. ENE uses exotic off-balance sheet financial
engineering that we do not believe is prevalent in the group.
* FERC kicks out Pacificorp contract - denying CPUC complaint for now
We don't think this should have been at FERC to begin with.
Any further review would come under CA refund proceedings.
* Implicit conclusion is that FERC does not want to review bilateral
deals
FERC's long-running stance is that bilateral contracts are not up
for review or refunds. Recent Pacific Northwest ALJ ruling
supports view that bilateral deals are off-limits.

"UCAP Translated In-City Cap Applicable to Mitigated Generators: $112.95","
ADesell@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

As directed by FERC in its September 4, 2001 Order in docket
ER01-2536-000, the NYISO has completed the calculation of the revenue
neutral translation into Unforced Capacity terms of the In-City $105 cap
applicable to Generators subject to market power mitigation measures.  In
the September 4, 2001 Order, the Commission decided that the ""translated
in-city price cap is to be fixed at an amount determined on the day of the
first in-city capacity auction under UCAP methodology"" using data from the
most recent 12-month period.  On the basis of Operating Data received by
the NYISO, the Capacity-weighted EFORd for all Generators subject to
market power mitigation measures for the 2001-2002 Winter Capability
Period Auction is 7.04%.  Thus, the In-City cap under the UCAP market
design, including the Capability Period Auction scheduled for October 1,
2001, is $112.95.

Yo Bro,

My brother-in-law (the wantabe day trader) has a good amount of Kinder
Morgan.  The price is down pretty low.  Is it just because of the economy?
Is this their cyclical low period?  Are they feeling some of the heat from
the Enron stock drop?  Let me know because if it is a bargain low. I want
to buy more too.  Let me know what you think.

"RE: NYISO - TCC - Autumn 2001 Initial TCC Auction - Notice of Roc	kland Electric Company Separation from NYCA","
""Depillo, Raymond V."" <Raymond.Depillo@pseg.com> writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

In regard to the message below, I was wondering if there is anyone out there
could shed some light on a few questions.

1.  Where could one go to find information on the Rockland Electric
reconfiguration (FERC filings or even just information updates)?
2.  Why was this not an issue in any of the longer term auctions?  Don't we
now have very inconsistent treatment across the various TCC auctions?
3.  When exactly will this happen?  Since I have yet to see a filing, can we
assume this will be done by November?  If not, it is obvious this move will
relieve congestion on Center East, and potentially lead to an
undercollection problem on TCC revenues?  If this is the case, will these
costs be socialized across all loads (TOs), or funded by the entity that
physically called for the removal of the load?
4.  What happens to any of the grandfathered rights (TCCs) associated with
serving this load?  Will the TO that served this load release those to the
market?  Will they just disappear?  Or will the TO be allowed to keep them?
5.  Will this move be coordinated with PJM or can we expect some gaps
between the treatment of the Rockland load between the two ISOs and their
various markets?

Thanks,

Ray

Recession Fear Shouldn't Hurt, But It Does

* Market orphans energy merchants in search for defensive profile
Stocks are rolling over with the energy sector as investors see
unregulated power as economically and/or cyclical like E&P and
Oil Services
* But unregulated power IS defensive
End demand for power is stable, non-cyclical, and not subject to
much consumer discretion. Unlike oil, market is regional with
pricing unlikely to be affected by current events.
* Big cap utilities outperforming - don't fight the tape
Big, liquid names like DUK, D, AEP, SO and TXU are leading
the way. Valuation differences between the likes of DUK and
MIR or DYN are reaching unrealistic levels.
* Other yield plays
Smaller cap names that have participated and could further in a
drive for yield - PGN, XEL, and PEG.

"FW: Electric Utilities:  Weekly Update","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	""Russo, Brian"" <Brian.Russo@ubsw.com>@ENRON   On Behalf Of ""Abramson, Barry"" <Barry.Abramson@ubsw.com>
Sent:	Monday, November 26, 2001 7:37 AM
To:	undisclosed-recipients:;@ENRON
Subject:	Electric Utilities:  Weekly Update

KEY POINTS
*	On the basis of the group's extremely low relative valuation, we continue to recommend the electric utility
group.  The electric group's P/E based upon 2002 estimated EPS is now only 10.8x, compared with a 2002 P/E for the S&P
500 of 24.5x.  The relative P/E ratio has dropped to just 0.44x, near its all-time low of 0.40x and well below the
25-year historic normal relative P/E range of 0.60x to 0.80x.
*	The high relative yield of 5.0% on the average electric utility stock also should provide good support against
any major downward move, in our opinion.  The relative yield on utility stocks is more than double the yields available
to small investors in cash equivalents such as money market funds.
*	The fully-regulated transmission and distribution utilities (T&D) appear to have stopped outperforming the
utilities that have a large merchant energy exposure.  The lower-risk, higher-yielding T&D stocks had been going up for
most of the past few months while the utilities with merchant energy had been falling.  Now it appears that the rotation
into the T&D stocks has ended, at least for now.
*	Last week, we added PPL Corp. (PPL-$35.80, rated Strong Buy)[2] to our Global Top 10 List of utility stocks.
The major reasons for adding PPL to the Global Top 10 List were the stock's very low relative P/E ratio, its fleet of
low-cost unregulated generating plants and its above-average earnings growth potential.  We also believe it is likely
that PPL might take actions to improve its very low stock price, such as a dividend hike and a common share buyback.  In
addition, at PPL's current low relative valuation, we believe it is an attractive takeover target.  There are four other
U.S. utility stocks on our Global Top 10 List-Dominion Resources (D-$59.96, rated Strong Buy)[2], Duke Energy
(DUK-$37.64, rated Strong Buy)[2], TXU Corp. (TXU-$45.87, rated Strong Buy)[2] and American Electric Power (AEP-$42.39,
rated Buy)[2].  The rest of our Global Top 10 List includes El Paso Energy (EPG-$49.73)[14] of the U.S., Suez-Lyonnaise
and Lattice Group of Europe, and Tokyo Electric Power and Chubu Electric of Asia.
*	The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued an order last week that changes the basis upon which FERC
will allow large utilities to sell wholesale power at market-based rates.  FERC's order is designed to reduce the
possibility that a large company could exert market power in a particular region.  FERC stated that if power sellers are
found to be ""pivotal to their region"" and if the sellers are not participating in a FERC approved regional transmission
organization (RTO), then the sellers could lose their right to charge market-based rates.  Sellers that are ""pivotal to
their region"" have generating units that must run to meet the region's electric load.  FERC applied these new rules
immediately to three large utilities-American Electric Power, Entergy Corp. (ETR-$36.95, rated Hold) and Southern
Company (SO-$23.50, rated Hold)[2].  FERC stated that all three of these large utilities are not now currently members
of a FERC approved RTO.  AEP, ETR and SO have lost the authority to make sales at market-based rates except for sales
that take place in regions where the grid is controlled by a FERC-approved RTO.  The three companies have been given 15
days to respond by FERC.  Under the new rules, FERC can order refunds and can order these companies to revert back to
cost-based rates.
*	It is possible that FERC is using this directive to strongly influence the rapid formation of FERC-approved
RTOs.  Some of the larger U.S utilities have been reluctant to join large RTOs and have tried to form their own RTOs in
which they would be the dominant member.  In the long run, we expect FERC to prevail and we expect all U.S. utilities,
large and small, to form RTOs that have FERC approval.  We think that the loss of the ability to sell wholesale power at
market-based rates, even if only for a short period of time until the company achieves compliance with FERC's RTO goals,
is a strong enough incentive for large utilities to move faster to join large RTOs.
*	We lowered our EPS estimates for Edison International (EIX-$14.20, rated Buy)[2,10] after the company held a
conference call last week at which time it gave new earnings guidance for 2001 and 2002.  We lowered our 2001 EPS
estimate from $1.75 to $1.30 and reduced our 2002 EPS estimate from $2.00 to $1.60.  It appears that EIX's major
emphasis over the next 1 to 2 years will be to improve its balance sheet and regain its financial health, and therefore,
earnings growth does not appear to be a major objective.
*	We reduced our 2002 EPS estimate on Cinergy Corp. (CIN-$30.87, rated Strong Buy) from $2.95 to $2.85.  Lower
forward power prices for 2002 and the weakness in the local economy are likely to hurt 2002 earnings.
*	TXU announced two major asset divestitures in the United Kingdom last week.  TXU plans to sell its U.K. electric
distribution business and its 50% interest in 24seven to London Electricity for $1.87 billion.  TXU also announced an
agreement to sell its 2,000 MW West Burton power station to London Electricity for $523 million.  We think that both of
these moves are positive steps for TXU.  (Additional details can be found in the following section of this report.)
*	Utility stocks lagged the overall market last week.  For the four trading days last week, electric utility
stocks were virtually unchanged, with an average gain of only 0.1%, compared with an increase of 1.0% for the S&P 500.
IPP stocks had a bad week, with an average decline of 3.1%.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK
---------------------
""When exactly will the economy and the stock market rebound?
Like any Fool, I haven't got a crystal ball. I just continue
to keep a focus on the companies I own, making sure that
their competitive advantages and cash-flow generating powers
are not diminished for the long haul. Those companies in a
solid position may take a hit during this economic storm we
are experiencing, but they are also set to shine brilliantly
in the years ahead when the economy gets back on track like
it inevitably will...eventually.""

Paul Larson, ""Third-Quarter Blues"" -- Full Story:

WEEKEND WARRIOR
---------------------
GET STARTED
We get a lot of email at The Motley Fool from people asking us
where to start: high-tech stocks, value stocks, bonds, mutual
funds, index funds? Also, what are the right formulas to use?
Should investors focus on price-to-earnings ratios, return on
equity, or return on invested capital? There's a lot to choose
from, so what's the right investment vehicle and which tools
should you use?

Forget all of it.

If you're new to investing and want to learn more, ignore the
strategies and tools mentioned above, just for a while, and get
centered. What this means is that you have to find out what kind
of investing appeals to you. Where's your center of gravity?

The best way to find your investing center in a hurry is by
hearing the stories of those who have already walked that road.

Richard McCaffery shares his list of the best investment books
around.

One Up on Wall Street, Peter Lynch

The Warren Buffett Portfolio, Robert Hagstrom

A Random Walk Down Wall Street, Burton Malkiel

Stocks for the Long Run, Jeremy Siegel

Common Stocks, Uncommon Profits, Philip Fisher

Common Sense on Mutual Funds, John Bogle

How amazing is this story. I worked with the father, he was an old H&Q guy and if anyone remembers, he is the one I used to smoke cigarettes with in his office. I am sure you remember when I went out to his funeral. Anyway, this story shows you just how amazing Rudy is after everything that has happened.
                                   RUDY KEEPS HIS WORD 
                               By KIRSTEN DANIS, DAVID SEIFMAN and BILL HOFFMANN 
                                                 September 17, 2001 -- Diane 
                                                 Gorumba of Brooklyn beamed with 
                                                 pride yesterday as Mayor Giuliani 
                                                 walked her down the aisle - and 
                                                 helped erase a nightmarish year of 
                                                 tragedy for the Brooklyn bride's 
                                                 family. 
                                                 The mayor kept a promise he made 
                                                 last month to Diane, 23, after her 
                                                 firefighter brother, Michael, who 
                                                 was supposed to give her away, 
                                                 died Aug. 28 while fighting a 
                                                 three-alarm blaze on Staten Island. 
                                                 ""We will go on. This proves it right 
                                                 here. The mayor came here - he 
                                                 thought about us,"" the beaming 
                                                 newlywed said as she jumped into a 
                                                 limo with husband, Michael Ferrito, 
                                                 31, a police officer at the 61st 
                                                 Precinct. 
                                                 Diane has already lived through 12 
                               months of her own horrors. Her grandfather died Sept. 13, 
                               2000, and 17 days later, her dad, an executive at J.P. 
                               Morgan Chase, also passed away. 
                               With her father gone, she asked her brother, a member of 
                               Engine Co. 163, to walk her down the aisle at St. James 
                               Lutheran Church in Gerrittsen Beach, and he agreed. 
                               Then, the Staten Island fire tragedy took Michael's life. 
                               At Michael's funeral, Diane sadly lamented to her mom, Gail, 
                               that there was nobody to escort her up to the altar. She 
                               half-jokingly turned to the mayor and asked, ""Why don't you 
                               do it?"" 
                               ""I'd be honored,"" Giuliani replied, without missing a beat. 
                               Yesterday morning, Giuliani - who has been working round 
                               the clock since the Twin Towers horror - said the wedding 
                               meant ""a great deal to him."" 
                               The mayor recalled asking Gail Gorumba, after her son died, 
                               how she has kept going through her grief. 
                               ""She feels the pain of it, she allows the pain to happen,"" 
                               Giuliani said. ""But then she focuses on the good things that 
                               are left in life, like her daughter's wedding. I thought about 
                               that a good deal of time this week."" 
                               The bride and groom's families said they will be eternally 
                               grateful to him. 
                               ""It meant more than I can ever, ever say. He's the best, and 
                               I wish we could re-elect him"" Diane said. 
                               As 225 people jammed the quaint 77-year-old church, the 
                               mayor gave Diane his left arm. 
                               Smiling happily for perhaps the first time since the Tuesday 
                               disaster, Giuliani - clad in black tie with a white rose in his 
                               lapel - slowly strode down the aisle and brought Diane to the 
                               groom. 
                               Then he lifted her veil and kissed her on the cheek. 
                               As the 30-minute ceremony proceeded, the mayor sat in the 
                               front row with the bride's mom. Afterward, Giuliani got into 
                               his car to head back to Manhattan, and the serious work at 
                               hand.

Dear Market Participants,

that all systems are ready before starting the program.

Virtual Trading will be in place for the Wednesday, November 7 Day-Ahead

virtual supply to be submitted for Wednesday's market after the DAM posts
on Monday, November 5, until 5:00 a.m. on Tuesday, November 6.
