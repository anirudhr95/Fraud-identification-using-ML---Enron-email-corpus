"RE:","Yes - I think so.  I am still employed, just waiting to be bought out by a bank like Citigroup or UBS.  It's been crazy to live through all of this shit.  This has been an incredible learning experience of what NOT to do in business.  These guys at the top are complete crooks.  Anyway, enough bs, Megan and I are heading up to Boston for X-mas, were getting together with Jon and Kati one day.  Well be out in Colorado for New Year's.

Ben,

I was again good to talk with you and I look forward to the
possibilities. As we spoke of, Joe Toussaint is heading up the talent
initiative and coordinating the recruiting process. I spoke with Joe
today and he informed me he had left several contact numbers for you so
I will at this point step out of the middle of process to allow for a
more coordinated approach. I'm sure I speak for Joe when I say we
believe the changes in the industry as well as Enron provide opportunity
for us both.

Please provide Joe with your resume as soon as you can and as we
discussed be prepared to discuss your desires, skills and/or experiences
you believe uniquely qualify you, as well as examples of your ability to
create value.

Again it has been my pleasure and I'm sure Joe or his designee will
contact you concerning your trip to Cincinnati and scheduled activities
next week.

Michael J. Cyrus

"RE: Kinder Morgan","Chobs:
Sorry it took so long to respond, but its been crazy around here.  Both KMI and KMP are still good buys, its just the overall market environment thats bringing these down.  Also, the commodities prices in gas and crude and fuel oil have come off quite a bit, which makes the general investors worry about the future earnings potential of the companies.  They are locked into contracts at a very good price, so whether the price of the commodity goes up or down they still make their cash flow targets.  Remember, the CEO of the company has a stack of over 25% of the company, so he is very tied to the overall stock price.  Enough said, invest your money into KMI and KMP, especially KMP since it has that yield of around 7%.  Talk to you soon.

Yo Bro,

My brother-in-law (the wantabe day trader) has a good amount of Kinder
Morgan.  The price is down pretty low.  Is it just because of the economy?
Is this their cyclical low period?  Are they feeling some of the heat from
the Enron stock drop?  Let me know because if it is a bargain low. I want
to buy more too.  Let me know what you think.

04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a ""material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" it warned.

To:	undisclosed-recipients:;@ENRON
Subject:	CIN:  Third Quarter EPS Increase 38%; Maintaining 2001E and 2002E	 EPS

KEY POINTS
*	CIN reported third quarter 2001 operating earnings of $0.80 per share, compared with $0.58 per share earned in
the third quarter of 2000.  The 38% increase in earnings per share is primarily due to strength in wholesale trading and
marketing and solid growth at the regulated utility operations.
*	Cinergy reaffirmed its 2001 earnings guidance of $2.75 per share.  Although no comments regarding 2002 estimated
earnings were provided by the company, we currently feel comfortable with our 2002E EPS of $2.95.  We expect Cinergy to
grow earnings at a conservative rate of 7%-8% per annum, with regulated operations growing at 5%-6% and energy merchant
operations growing at 10%-12%.  However, if the economy weakens further and wholesale power prices remain at current
levels we may revisit on 2002 estimated earnings per share at a later date.
*	Energy Merchant segment earnings were $0.37 per share, more than double the $0.15 per share earned in last
year's third quarter.  Origination, marketing and trading gross margins rose $43 million, or $0.07 per share, to $217.1
million from $174.1 million last year.  Electricity trading volumes totaled 86,398,499 mWh, up 150% from last year's
levels.  Physical and financial gas trading volumes totaled 48.1 bcf per day, up 160% over the same period last year.
Cinergy Solutions, the segment's cogeneration business, added $0.03 per share in the quarter.  Also, CIN added roughly
1,100 MW of new gas-fired peaking capacity since the third quarter last year.
*	Regulated Operations earned $0.48 per share in the latest quarter, compared with $0.46 per share in the third
quarter 2000.  Gross margins improved due to increased customer demand from service territory growth and warmer weather.
This was offset slightly by increased operations and maintenance and interest expenses.  Total electric retail sales
volumes were 13,898,726 mWh, up 3.6% over last year's level.  Gas retail and transportation sales volumes declined 10.8%
to 10,248,332 mcf.  The decrease was primarily related to weather as well as softening industrial demand.  As of
September 2001, total electric customers were 1,500,790, up from 1,481,411 a year ago and total gas customers were
489,667, up from 482,328 a year ago.
*	Results from the Power Technology and Infrastructure Services segment lost $0.05 per share, down from a loss of
$0.03 in the prior year.  Through Cinergy Ventures Group, this division pursues technology equity investments and runs
technology pilots.  CIN owns several start-up energy infrastructure companies that incurred additional costs as well as
roughly $100 million of direct and indirect investments in power technology-related companies that decreased in value
during the third quarter.
*	We continue to rate shares of CIN Strong Buy. Our 12-month price target of $37 per share is based upon a P/E
multiple of 12.5 times our 2002 EPS estimate of $2.95. In our opinion, the premium valuation is warranted. CIN is a low
cost producer of electricity (primarily coal) that is strategically located in the Midwest, and is actively adding to
its merchant generation portfolio. In total, Cinergy Corp. owns 13,000 MW of generation capacity. Of that total, 6,000
MW is regulated and 7,000 MW is unregulated. Because of Cinergy Corp.'s strategic location and its large fleet of
low-cost power plants, we think the company would be attractive to potential acquirers.

The language is fine, except replace ""Zonal Prices"" as the third heading reference below with ""LBMP ($/MWHr)"" -- ex. ""Real Time Market LBMP - Zonal; LBMP ($/MWHr); WEST (61752)"".

What did you think of the presentation thus far and what other type of info are you looking for.  The rest of the presentation is not that strategy oriented like the pages I gave you, but I will go through it and see if any of the other pages will help.  The key is to get an idea of what they are trying to do so that you can craft in that fashion.  I am playing tennis at 3:00, but will call you later to talk more about the presentation and tomorrow's meeting.

"RE:","Unfortunately yes.  The traders and finance folks were kept on to perform unwind and liquidation functions.  The trading group, the group I am in, is really the only group with value besides the pipleines, thus we will probably be sold off to a bank like Citi or JPM.  I wouldn't mind that because they understand the trading business of commodities as well as equities and fixed income.  This as been an amazing experience and taught me alot about over leverage and strategic, really about what not to due, which can be as important as what to do in business.  99% of the folks are good hardworking people, but its the few finance guys at the top that brought this company down.  It really is a shame to see all these people yesterday get laid off.  It was so sad.  Luckily, by accident I had sold off most of my options last year, but still lost a little 401 k dough, but I still have my health as my mom likes to say.  On a good note we got your picture of the little tike, looks great.  I hope all is going well and thanks for the e-mail.  Talk to you soon.

thinkgs are bleak but not as dire as other groups (the credit of our counterparties are even sketchier than ours) but our trades have dropped off since last wednesday  -Shankman is coming tomorrow -I think to deliver the proverbial ax -the question is will the market deliver it sooner. I thought Ch. 11 would be first? (it may be moot anyway)

How amazing is this story. I worked with the father, he was an old H&Q guy and if anyone remembers, he is the one I used to smoke cigarettes with in his office. I am sure you remember when I went out to his funeral. Anyway, this story shows you just how amazing Rudy is after everything that has happened.
                                   RUDY KEEPS HIS WORD 
                               By KIRSTEN DANIS, DAVID SEIFMAN and BILL HOFFMANN 
                                                 September 17, 2001 -- Diane 
                                                 Gorumba of Brooklyn beamed with 
                                                 pride yesterday as Mayor Giuliani 
                                                 walked her down the aisle - and 
                                                 helped erase a nightmarish year of 
                                                 tragedy for the Brooklyn bride's 
                                                 family. 
                                                 The mayor kept a promise he made 
                                                 last month to Diane, 23, after her 
                                                 firefighter brother, Michael, who 
                                                 was supposed to give her away, 
                                                 died Aug. 28 while fighting a 
                                                 three-alarm blaze on Staten Island. 
                                                 ""We will go on. This proves it right 
                                                 here. The mayor came here - he 
                                                 thought about us,"" the beaming 
                                                 newlywed said as she jumped into a 
                                                 limo with husband, Michael Ferrito, 
                                                 31, a police officer at the 61st 
                                                 Precinct. 
                                                 Diane has already lived through 12 
                               months of her own horrors. Her grandfather died Sept. 13, 
                               2000, and 17 days later, her dad, an executive at J.P. 
                               Morgan Chase, also passed away. 
                               With her father gone, she asked her brother, a member of 
                               Engine Co. 163, to walk her down the aisle at St. James 
                               Lutheran Church in Gerrittsen Beach, and he agreed. 
                               Then, the Staten Island fire tragedy took Michael's life. 
                               At Michael's funeral, Diane sadly lamented to her mom, Gail, 
                               that there was nobody to escort her up to the altar. She 
                               half-jokingly turned to the mayor and asked, ""Why don't you 
                               do it?"" 
                               ""I'd be honored,"" Giuliani replied, without missing a beat. 
                               Yesterday morning, Giuliani - who has been working round 
                               the clock since the Twin Towers horror - said the wedding 
                               meant ""a great deal to him."" 
                               The mayor recalled asking Gail Gorumba, after her son died, 
                               how she has kept going through her grief. 
                               ""She feels the pain of it, she allows the pain to happen,"" 
                               Giuliani said. ""But then she focuses on the good things that 
                               are left in life, like her daughter's wedding. I thought about 
                               that a good deal of time this week."" 
                               The bride and groom's families said they will be eternally 
                               grateful to him. 
                               ""It meant more than I can ever, ever say. He's the best, and 
                               I wish we could re-elect him"" Diane said. 
                               As 225 people jammed the quaint 77-year-old church, the 
                               mayor gave Diane his left arm. 
                               Smiling happily for perhaps the first time since the Tuesday 
                               disaster, Giuliani - clad in black tie with a white rose in his 
                               lapel - slowly strode down the aisle and brought Diane to the 
                               groom. 
                               Then he lifted her veil and kissed her on the cheek. 
                               As the 30-minute ceremony proceeded, the mayor sat in the 
                               front row with the bride's mom. Afterward, Giuliani got into 
                               his car to head back to Manhattan, and the serious work at 
                               hand.

The Flipped-Over Rock

February 21, 2002

By WILLIAM SAFIRE




WASHINGTON -- What wife of a United States senator profited
from her close association with a big company that did
heavy lobbying of the federal government and then went
bust, costing investors billions and workers their jobs?

Why, Wendy Gramm, most recently awakened watchdogs would
say, wife of the Republican Phil Gramm of Texas, previous
chairman of the Banking Committee. As a director of Enron,
she was on the audit committee that didn't question the
fast-and- loose auditing, and (subtracting the deferred
compensation that went into the tank) received about
$220,000 over eight years.

That's peanuts, say Republicans. The senatorial wife who
hit it big was Anne Bingaman, married to New Mexico's Jeff
Bingaman, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources
Committee. As lobbyist for the telecommunications comet
Global Crossing, which went bankrupt last month, she
received $2,500,000 for six months' work during 1999.

Both senatorial wives are accomplished executives who
parlayed responsible government appointments into lucrative
private positions.

Wendy Gramm was chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. Anne Bingaman was Bill Clinton's assistant
attorney general for antitrust until leaving in June 1996.
Her lobbying fee for delaying approval of a competitor's
undersea cable still makes Beltway bandits gasp.

This juxtaposition shows that the Enron scandal is having
only bipartisan political fallout; in this case, the
""everybody did it"" defense works. (You can bet that neither
spouse will be subpoenaed and publicly humiliated by the
club member Fritz Hollings at the Commerce Committee.)
Because both the biggest bankrupt (Enron) and the
fourth-biggest bankrupt (Global Crossing) made
contributions to politicians of both parties, the resulting
public disgust has been used to advance bipartisan campaign
finance reform.

Enron, which mostly embarrassed Republicans, has been wrung
dry in the media; the sight of the tilted ""E"" symbol
elicits yawns from viewers. It's the telecommunications
giant Global Crossing's turn in the barrel; now we'll be
hearing about Clinton connections on its board and its
boss's million-dollar contribution to the Clinton library.

Especially delicious will be the examination of Terry
McAuliffe, the fabled fund-raiser whom Bill Clinton
insisted the Democratic National Committee take on as
chairman. McAuliffe says he merely invested $100,000 in
Global Crossing and sold it for $18 million, and what's the
big deal? What his D.N.C. spokesman won't say is what price
per share he paid before the company went public, and what
that stock was worth when it went on the market - and what
he did to earn the difference. (Same question could be
directed to Bush the elder.)

But after the politicians tire of wounding each other and
declare a truce, we may see some overdue action on the
control of financial derivatives. These are the
investments, often off the books, in futures and currencies
that slice and dice risk and have made instant
billionaires, but whose abuse has been disastrous to
investors from Orange County to Long-Term Capital
Management.

Hedge funds are supposed to spread and reduce risk; in
reality, they are often used to make huge bets unknown to
their institutional investors. Accountants are supposed to
enforce disclosure of all liabilities, but many have become
expert in the concealment of risk.

I don't profess to understand the worries some of my
financial sources express about dangerous excesses in the
convertible bond market, ""swaptions"" and ever-narrowing
derivatives. But my unwillingness to break my head learning
these intricacies gives the wheeler-dealers an edge.
Complication and secrecy are mother's milk to them, while
the average investor's best protection is full disclosure.

When you flip over a flat rock like Enron or Global
Crossing, you see much panicky scurrying-about by those who
like to work in the dark. For too long, new-economy
corporate creeps and their accounting Heeps have hidden
risk in arcane off-the-books dealing. The new S.E.C.
chairman, Harvey Pitt, seems not to get it: Stop pretending
it's a political scandal and start dealing with the
accounting and derivatives scandal.

Hey Ben-

Hope you had a great holiday and you guys are staying busy.  Things down in EIM are looking a little more promising since our current direction is to hold onto some of our assets and potentially take a group of people forward to do some low-credit trading....I'm cautiously optimistic.

I did want your recommendation on any books for someone interested in learning about power trading.  Any ideas?

Thanks Ben-

Its been a very interesting ride these last four and a half years here.  I received an offer from UBS, but decided to turn it down for personal reasons.  These last few weeks I have been with the estate working on selling certain assets.  Tomorrow is my last day with the estate and then I am off to Ohio and Cinergy to continue trading.  I will also begin to learn the oprations of Cinergy as well as go back and get an executive MBA at Chicago.  Ultimately, I want to learn more about the overall operations and effective energy risk management.  
I just wanted to thank you for all you have done while I have been here.  I look back and think that I should have spent time in the pipeline group.  Even after all that has happened I certainly wouldn't change what I have experienced.  Thanks again for being such a good friend.  Hope you are doing well and good luck with everything.  I will send you my new information at Cinergy.  My Dad would love to hear from you sometime.

                                                 walked her down the aisle - and 
                                                 helped erase a nightmarish year of 
                                                 tragedy for the Brooklyn bride's 
                                                 family. 
                                                 The mayor kept a promise he made 
                                                 last month to Diane, 23, after her 
                                                 firefighter brother, Michael, who 
                                                 was supposed to give her away, 
                                                 died Aug. 28 while fighting a 
                                                 three-alarm blaze on Staten Island. 
                                                 ""We will go on. This proves it right 
                                                 here. The mayor came here - he 
                                                 thought about us,"" the beaming 
                                                 newlywed said as she jumped into a 
                                                 limo with husband, Michael Ferrito, 
                                                 31, a police officer at the 61st 
                                                 Precinct. 
                                                 Diane has already lived through 12 
                               months of her own horrors. Her grandfather died Sept. 13, 
                               2000, and 17 days later, her dad, an executive at J.P. 
                               Morgan Chase, also passed away. 
                               With her father gone, she asked her brother, a member of 
                               Engine Co. 163, to walk her down the aisle at St. James 
                               Lutheran Church in Gerrittsen Beach, and he agreed. 
                               Then, the Staten Island fire tragedy took Michael's life. 
                               At Michael's funeral, Diane sadly lamented to her mom, Gail, 
                               that there was nobody to escort her up to the altar. She 
                               half-jokingly turned to the mayor and asked, ""Why don't you 
                               do it?"" 
                               ""I'd be honored,"" Giuliani replied, without missing a beat. 
                               Yesterday morning, Giuliani - who has been working round 
                               the clock since the Twin Towers horror - said the wedding 
                               meant ""a great deal to him."" 
                               The mayor recalled asking Gail Gorumba, after her son died, 
                               how she has kept going through her grief. 
                               ""She feels the pain of it, she allows the pain to happen,"" 
                               Giuliani said. ""But then she focuses on the good things that 
                               are left in life, like her daughter's wedding. I thought about 
                               that a good deal of time this week."" 
                               The bride and groom's families said they will be eternally 
                               grateful to him. 
                               ""It meant more than I can ever, ever say. He's the best, and 
                               I wish we could re-elect him"" Diane said. 
                               As 225 people jammed the quaint 77-year-old church, the 
                               mayor gave Diane his left arm. 
                               Smiling happily for perhaps the first time since the Tuesday 
                               disaster, Giuliani - clad in black tie with a white rose in his 
                               lapel - slowly strode down the aisle and brought Diane to the 
                               groom. 
                               Then he lifted her veil and kissed her on the cheek. 
                               As the 30-minute ceremony proceeded, the mayor sat in the 
                               front row with the bride's mom. Afterward, Giuliani got into 
                               his car to head back to Manhattan, and the serious work at 
                               hand.

This most recent year I was in the power trading group for Enron working in the Northeast market, where I was a junior trader, but doing alot of senior trader type stuff.  I would be interested in talking with those guys if they are looking for someone like myself.  I know that most of the senior traders are staying with UBS.  There are a couple who have been looking elsewhere, some I think with Goldman.  Let me see where those guys are at.

Subject:	FW: Comments on the Status of ENE ($16/sh).






--------------- Authored by: Jeff Dietert ----------------
OUR VIEW:  ENE is down huge (-80% for the year, and trading at only
7.5xFY02) and its hard to imagine more confusion associated with the stock.
More pressure is likely today on the news of S&P revising its long-term
ratings outlook to negative (based on the decline in market capitalization)
and ENE's additional draw on its credit facilities (which does not change
its net debt, but prevents banks from denying access to its liquidity in
the event that the rating agencies do downgrade its credit rating, which
could break covenants and restrict liquidity).  We believe the major issues
are: 1) management's ability to regain the confidence of the street and
persuade investors that it can restore balance sheet strength and generate
the expected earnings and cash flow,  2) ENE must maintain its investment
grade credit rating, 3) ENE must successfully execute its divestiture
plans, and 4) ENE must control the timing of the recognition of the
write-down in the value of any assets whose market value is less than book.

IF ENE management does not step-up to calm investor fears, these fears
could become a self fulfilling prophecy.  In the potentially vicious cycle,
investor fears could drive the stock down, the lower stock prices force the
rating agencies to consider downgrades, potentially lower credit ratings
force counter-parties to reduce exposure with ENE, limiting ENE's to
generate earnings and cash flow.  Thus we see a big incentive for ENE to
clarify the issues.  We expect ENE to put together a more complete
explanation of the major issues over the next few days in order to
stabilize the stock.   If/when ENE schedules a conference call or road
show, we would consider this a bullish sign.  Absent further clarification,
the stock is likely to continue to be weak.   Our gut feel is that ENE can
pull it off and that long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually
the stock gets valued on earnings (with upside potential to $25+/sh over
the next 12 to 18 month period), rather than break-up value ($16/sh-see
below).  We believe new money (with high risk tolerance!) should wait until
ENE announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery.

ENE's VIEW:  ENE has stated that it has reviewed its asset base with Arthur
Anderson and that no additional asset impairments are required other than
an approximate $200 MM charge expected in 1Q02 due to an accounting change.
With no further asset write-downs, and roughly $890 MM in asset
divestitures ($390 MM India E&P, $250 MM Puerto Rico power plant, and $250
MM Brazilian power plant) in 4Q01, ENE's D/TC ratio is likely to decline
from 50% at the end of 3Q01 to roughly 48% at the end of the year.  After
the close of the Portland General divestiture, expected by year-end 2002,
we expect its D/TC to fall below 45% (we are projecting FCF to be
break-even in FY02).  We estimate that ENE's interest coverage at the end
of 3Q01 is 3.5x.  ENE is currently rated BBB+ by S&P and Baa1 by Moodys,
and would need to decline 3 ratings to fall below investment grade.  For
comparison purposes, S&P's BBB median D/TC is 47.4% and EBITDA/Int. Exp.
coverage is 6.1x, while BB (non-investment grade) median D/TC is 61.3% and
interest coverage is 3.8x.

IMPORTANCE OF ENE's INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING:  We believe that ENE's
Wholesale segments, which generates 80% of its EBIT, would be
noncompetitive if the credit rating falls below investment grade.  In
addition, a decline in credit rating below investment grade would trigger
the issuance of 50 MM shares of common stock and $1 B in convertible
preferred stock associated with ENE's off-balance sheet structured
financing vehicles.  We believe ENE will do what ever it can to maintain an

investment grade rating.  Moodys has its BBB+ rating under review for a
possible downgrade.   Last night S&P revised its long-term ratings outlook
to negative due to concerns that the significant drop in market
capitalization in the past week has adversely affected the company's
financial flexibility and could impede its ability to pursue plans to
rebuild its balance sheet.

BREAK-UP VALUE:  We believe ENE 's Wholesale America ($2.7 B in TTM
EBITDA), Wholesale Europe ($900 MM) and Retail ($450 MM) segments are
conservatively worth a 4x multiple (recent multiples have been higher, but
we are discounting due to limited buying interest) or $16.2 B.  The Gas
Pipeline segment ($820 MM) and Global Assets ($200 MM) valued at a 6x
multiple are worth $6.1 B.  PGE valued at the divestiture price is $2.9 B.
Total asset value is conservatively $25 B, vs. debt of $13 B, leaving $12 B
or $16/sh for equity investors in a break-up scenario.  The challenge is,
if ENE loses its investment grade rating, the value ($16.2 B) of its
Wholesale and Retail segments would be materially compromised--leaving
little for equity investors.

POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS:  ENE's Global Assets portfolio
includes assets with $6 B in book value (ENE's total gross PP&E is $14 B)
that has generated an EBIT loss of $18 MM (EBITDA of +$168 MM) over the
last 12-month period (4Q00 to 3Q01).  The Global Assets portfolio includes
Elektro (an electric utility in Brazil), Dabhol (power plant in India), TGS
(a natural gas pipeline in Argentina), Azurix and Enron Wind operations.
These assets seem ripe for a write-down although the company argues that it
has reviewed them with Arthur Anderson recently and that the assets are not
impaired.  ENE will have to continue to convince Anderson that the value of
these assets has not been impaired.  The write-down of these assets would
reduce shareholder equity and ENE's D/TC, threatening its credit rating.
It is not clear that ENE put all its under-performing assets in the Global
Assets portfolio.  There could be other poor performing assets in other
segments that are hidden by strong performance in its Wholesale business.

ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS:  ENE's counter-parties seem to be supportive and
have not indicated any change in business activity.  EnronOnline trading
volume was slightly above average yesterday.  Some energy traders have
bought ENE in their personal accounts, convinced that ENE core marketing
business is strong and the belief that the equity markets have
over-reacted.  Lots of ENE corporate finance people are working late nights
solidifying ENE's financial strategy (hopefully for a more complete
discussion with the street?).

THE SEC INQUIRY:  We believe ENE has an extensive paper trail from its
attorneys and accountants that will clear them of any legal problems with
the SEC associated with the LJM partnerships in which CFO Andy Fastow
participated.  We do not expect the SEC to find any legal
wrong-doing--although this doesn't mean that they won't express qualitative
concern over the appearance of the transactions.

Ben,
I don't know who you may know on the trading side.  Goldman Sachs is looking
for a Senior Power Trader, paying anywhere from 150-180 on a base salary
with the bonus ranging anywhere from 3-500k.  They will guarantee the
compensation for the first year.  Do you know of anyone falling out there
who might be interested?  I appreciate the referrals.
Thanks,
Rosanna

It all comes down to the rotten deal culture this place became.  I-banks have this kind of deal culture, but they seem to have the right controls in place, plus they are a lot bigger and the SEC is a clear watchdog in their dealings.

"Power Trading Group","Mr. Lay:
It was good to see you down on the trading floor today.  I have been in the power trading group for about a year now.  I came over from the corp. development group after we sold the peakers to Allegheny and to Cinergy.  I was the one who convinced my Dad to buy those two peakers.
The power trading group is a really solid group of individuals.  Sitting where I do I see and hear alot of what goes on in the heart on Enron and I feel that this part of the company is doing really well.  
I have been with Enron for over four years now and I continue to learn alot as well as contribute to Enron's bottom line.  Eventhough Enron's stock price has come off a little I still think this is a great company and that the overall fundamentals are very sound.  I hope all is going well! 

Regards,
Ben
