"RE: Larry May - AMU Student","Hi Dr. Leerburger,

Thanks for your feedback.  I know how busy you must be - I have three kids (7,5 and 2) so I realize how precious time off is.  I applyed to DIA, NSA and CIA about three weeks ago.  I got letters back stating my application had been recieved.  The DIA said I have been put into their applicant pool.  My company (Enron) has offered me a position in London managing a trading desk for crude oil and refined products.  They want me to move over in January or Febuary, so hopefully I'll know something before then.  If I'm not offered anything by then, I'll probably go and plan on applying to Georgetown in one to two years.  I really hope I'm offered a position now - London would be interesting - but with everything that is going on now, I'd rather start this new career now.

Thanks again for your feedback and I hope to speak with you when time permits.  If you are teaching the Threat Assesment course at AMU Spring 2002, I'll probably be in your class.

Sincerely,

Larry May

Hi Larry;

First, I find the work to be exceedingly rewarding, and addictive. I have been working in the
community for 17 years, and have found that I am listened to, allowed to speak and take
risks, and allowed to provide realtime assistance to the top policy makers in our country.
My frustrations are that at times, I would like to enact action quickly, and often have to wait
for others to add their pieces to the puzzle, or for a chain of command to look at my ideas (I
am a GS-14 in a GS-15/DISL job). For someone like me, that's hard!

I would think your background WOULD make you a viable candidate, and would recommend that
you apply to CIA, DIA, and NSA, among others. Yuo can apply directly through each of their
websites. ALL are hiring.

Georgetown's program is terrific. I went there. JMIC is okay, but I think Georgetown would
give you what you really need. Georgetown's National Security Studies Program is TOP.

I'd be more than happy to speak with you, but recommend waiting a bit. My time is not really
my own these days,and I am currently working 7 days a week, literally (my last day off was
9 September), often 12-16 hours a day. When I get home, I do my school work, and play with my kids.
That doesn't leave much time! Let's see if things calm down in a week or so?

Hi Larry!
 
How are you?  A little time has passed since I was last on the trading floor of what was Enron.  Hope you're hanging in there okay.  =)  I'd just been enjoying the holidays and the time off up until last week when I started really hitting the job hunt.  I talked to you about a month ago at the Front Porch about a publishing contact you had in New York and was wondering if you would pass that information along?  And if you know of anyone who's looking for analyst help, I hope you will keep me in mind and pass my name along.
Thanks so much, Larry.  My best to you and your family for the New Year.

Subject:	ELM Finance Course Offerings


 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

I had discussed with you an extension for RC502 and I would like to propose finishing the course in January of 2002.   I am currently enrolled in RC520 and will finish this course as per the regular schedule.  The reason for my extension request is due to an unexpected increase in workload from my current job, my desire to focus on the Analytic methods course and my decision to apply to the DIA JMIC Graduate training program (I wish to spend a good deal of time time on the application).

'I dream only of having my hand again'	
	
FROM ANTHONY LOYD IN GOLBAHAR 	
	
KARIMULLAH is an Afghan who does not want to relate his war story. In a land where everyone is quick to tell their tale, his silence makes him unique.  He stood alone in the narrow midday shadows of the hospital courtyard when I saw him yesterday, a mix of glittering fury and blank despair. He had hobbled into the Red Crosss orthopaedic centre in Golbahar on Saturday.  Even among the other amputees, his injuries stood out. Mines can take off both legs and both arms, or the limbs of one side, or, more often, just a single leg or foot. Karimullah's injuries, however, had a different cause. When, reluctantly, he had finished accounting for the loss of his left foot and right hand there was nothing to do but leave the man to his blade-eyed stare.  The son of Tajik parents, now 26 years old, he fled Kabul when the Taleban arrived in 1996. Moving north to a village in Northern Alliance territory with his wife and two children, he found work in a vineyard. But he lost his job and home to a Taleban advance in 1998. He joined the Mujahidin.  A shell hit his post on the Samali Plain in 1999. It killed four of his comrades. Karimullah escaped to a Pashtun village whose inhabitants handed him over to the Taleban. Tried by a ""military tribunal"" in Kabul, after torture he was sent to the city's Pulecharkhi jail for having served with the Alliance.  ""I had been there 12 weeks when three Talebs came into my cell,"" he said. ""They called my name out and said I was to be released."" Baffled but relieved, Karimullah was led to a Datsun pick-up.  ""They began driving me to the Ghazi stadium,"" Karimullah said. ""I was silent at the beginning, but as we neared it I asked, 'What is this? What of my release?' They told me, 'Wait you will be released'.""  The Datsun drove into the centre of the stadium. Karimullah recalls thousands of faces staring at him in silence from the stands, and between 10 and 14 mullahs on chairs in a line in the middle of the field. He was pulled from the truck and told to lie spreadeagled on the grass.  ""The mullahs didn't even ask my name or speak to the crowd. Seven doctors approached me. They wore grey uniforms, surgical masks and gloves. I could see one was crying. They injected me. After five minutes my body was numb though I was still conscious. Then they put clamps on my hand and foot and began to cut them off with special saws. There was no pain but I could see what they were doing.""  I asked him if he stared at the sky. He told me he was transfixed by the sight of his foot being removed.  ""There was a sigh and murmur from the crowd when they finished. It had taken about five minutes. Taleban guards threw me into the back of the pick-up. One was crying too. Nothing was said. Even now I am unaware why I was chosen for amputation"".  He was taken to Kabul's Wazir Akbar Khan hospital. After a week eight of his former prison guards visited him. They brought him apples and 600,000 afghanis (?10).  ""They apologised. They told me they had not known what would happen. I threw the money and apples back at them. I screamed that they had told me I would be released and instead had taken my foot and hand for nothing. They left.""  On the tenth day he was discharged. A taxi took him to his parents' home. They had no idea what had happened to him.  Karimullah's eight-year-old sister, Razia, answered the taxi-driver's knock on the door. She burst into tears when she saw her brother sprawled in the back of the cab. Worse was to follow. ""My mother had been ill for some time so was very weak. When she saw me, she collapsed. She regained consciousness for a few hours, but then had a heart attack and died.  ""I thought the worst day of my life had been in the stadium. Coming home was worse. Her name was Masherin. She was 42.""  He became a beggar, his mutilation carrying with it the stigma and shame of the punishment normally meted out to a thief.  Then, a few weeks ago, a cousin, a Mujahidin commander, got a message through the lines offering him help. Borrowing a spare prosthetic leg from a mine victim in Kabul, Karimullah limped northwards for days, crossing the front with other refugees.The Red Cross is preparing a prosthetic leg for him, but some scars cannot be repaired.  ""I am finished. I have no future,"" Karimullah said. ""I have had everything taken from me by the Taleban. Before they came to Kabul I was a student in the tenth grade, an educated man with some chances before me.  ""Someone told me a rich Pashtun had committed a crime and paid the corrupt mullahs to use a prisoner of war for public amputation instead of himself. I don't know if it's true. But I hate them.  ""I dream only of having my hand again so I could carry a gun and go to the front line and kill and kill. I'd kill them all, every Taleb and every mullah.""

Subject:	Houston Ballet's Miller Theater Performance of Coppelia


Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp?lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp?lia  tells the story of a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric toymaker Dr. Copp?lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp?lia to the people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp?lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th?atre Imp?rial de L'Op?ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L?on and music by L?o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: ""Copp?lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue.""
Copp?lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp?lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d?cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp?lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp?lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp?lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the eye-popping toys featured in 	the workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

Dear Larry,
 
          How are  things?  How is your family doing?  I recently got back from a  great vacation with my family in Vancouver.  Since leaving Enron I have  been very busy rehabbing some old houses in the Rice University  area.  I am very excited as we have some tenants about to move  in.  It's a real sense of accomplishment to work through a project like  that from start to finish.  You can check out my website at www.bluezephyr.com << File: http://www.bluezephyr.com >>  . I should have  some pictures up of the properties by the end of the week.  Anyway, I  wanted to let you know that I am busy applying to other companies in the Houston  area and have used your name as my supervisor and contact reference for my time  at Enron.  I hope you don't mind?  Some of these companies might  contact you as part of my background check!  Anyway, how are things at  work?  It seems that the media really can't get enough of the Enron  mess.  Do you plan to stay with UBS? Do you have a home email  account?  Well, I hope everything is going well for you!  All the  best!

Dear Dr. Leerburger,

I am a part-time student at American Military University in the MA program in Intelligence Studies.  Currently, I am enrolled in Dr. Lockwood's Analytic Methods course.  I have been planning to finish my MA (I have an MBA from the University of Washington as well) in three years and then begin a second career in intelligence analysis (I am currently an Energy commodities trader with Enron Corp in Houston, Texas).  However, with the events on Sept. 11, I wish to apply now for a position.  If it is convenient,  I would like to discuss career opportunities in government service with you.  Attached are the cover letter and resume I have already sent the DIA and NSA.  Given the events of the last few weeks,  I know you must be extremely busy and appreciate any time you may spare.

Sincerely,


Lawrence J. May

"re: Larry May - AMU Student","Dear Dr. Leerburger,

Thank you for your response.  As I wrote in my earlier note, I am seeking a career change into intelligence analysis. My work the last eleven years probably has a similar skill set - I basically process a great deal of information each day in order to arrive at decisions positioning a large commodity portfolio for my company.  As you may see from my resume and cover letter, I also have several years of military experience in the Navy's aviation and intelligence communities

Given the serious nature of this career change, I wish to speak to someone currently working in this field (I read your biography on the AMU website ).  My questions include:

 - Do you find the work to be rewarding?  What are the attractions and frustrations of the work?
 - Does my current background make me an attractive candidate for a mid-level position in the intelligence community?
 - If my background is currently lacking in some respects, would a graduate level program (I'm applying to both the DIA JMIC      program and Georgetown's Security Studies MA program) be a good choice?  How do these programs rate within the intelligence community?

If convenient, I would like to speak with you concerning these questions.  I thank you for any assistance you may provide.

Sincerely,



Lawrence May

I calculated a mini-book on deal 'YG8699.1'. The post-id is 1387936. Please take a look at it.

If you have any other post-ids you want to test with this new version, please let me know, so I can run this new port_calc for you.

Thank you very much, that is exactly what I wanted to know.
Yes if the IF vol curve exists, use IF-vol + NG skew, if IF vol curve does not exsist, use NG vol + NG skew

Subject:	vol skew

Brad, 

I did two post-ids. I used the current production port_calc (3.15) to calculate 1389454 and I used the old version(3.14) to calculate 1389464. I do see a P& L change on 1389454.

I debugged it and found a bunch of deals with changes in P& L value. Enclosed is a partial list of those deals. The reasons are: 

In old version(3.14), we calculate volatility of basis options like this

1) we calculate the NG volatility
2) If it's a basis option, we fetch the IF- volatility curve. If IF- volatility curve exists, we use IF-volatility curve.
3) If IF- volatility curve does not exist, we still use NG volatility.

In the current production version(3.15), we calculate volatility of basis options like this

1) we calculate the NG volatility + NG vol skew. (The NG vol skew is based on NG price - fixed price)
2) If it's a basis option, we fetch the IF-volatility curve. If IF-volatility curve exists, we use IF- volatility curve.
3) If IF-volatility curve does not exist, we still use NG volatility + NG vol skew which was calculated in step 1).

The bug in the currenct production portcalc is that in step 2), we didn't apply vol skew upon IF vol. In our new fix, this bug will be fixed.

However, the IF volatility curves of those enclosed deals do not exist. So the current production version (3.15) used the NG vol + NG vol skew for those deals. The old version (3.14) used the NG vol for those deals. Thus you see P&L change in these two versions.

Also we'd like to confirm with you that in the new fix, if the IF vol curve does not exist, you still want us to use NG vol + NG vol skew instead of erroring out. If the IF vol curve exists, we will use IF vol + NG vol skew.

Thanks,
Jennifer
