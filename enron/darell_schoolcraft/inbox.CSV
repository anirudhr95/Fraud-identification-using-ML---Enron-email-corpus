Lindy/John/Darrell, I need to find out who to send this budget to for 2002 monthly billings (Billings should be 12 equal payments made on Budget Figures, not Actuals).  I know in the past Je Chang did these billings, but don't know who does them now.  If you could let me know I would appreciate it.		Thanks,  tj

"Travel Services","
While recent events have dramatically impacted Enron's travel volume,
Alliance Worldwide (formerly Travel Agency in the Park) wanted to contact
you regarding the Enron Travel Program.  Since 1984, our company has been a
strategic business partner with Enron and has provided a complete scope of
services from booking, ticketing, ticket delivery, customer service,
reporting, management of ClickTrip, to facilitating preferred vendor
arrangements with airlines to benefit Enron.    These services have been
provided on a management fee basis from Alliance to Enron.  As of December
1, 2001 the management fee has been suspended during Enron's period of
reorganization.  We are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to
Enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing
fee per ticket.

To provide you with a brief history of our arrangement, Enron and Alliance
approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront
discounts for Enron's business travel.  These discounts are available only
through Alliance and are given at time of ticketing.  All commissions were
stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to Enron, in
exchange for Enron paying Alliance a contracted management fee.  This
management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each Enron cost center
based on the total number of transactions.  This travel program provided
Enron over $8.6 million in airline savings on $55 million spent in the year
2000 and over $5.2 million on $33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of
2001.  These savings are after the payment of the travel agency management
fee.

The effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by
the airlines cannot yet be determined.  We have contacted the airline
companies and most of Enron's preferred carriers have agreed to extend the
contracts through April 2002.  You may utilize these discounts through
Alliance by calling 713 650-8080 or 1 800 962-0248.  In March, Enron and
Alliance will begin evaluating Enron's volume and travel patterns, and
determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure.


As mentioned earlier, Alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in
lieu of a management fee.  These fees are reimbursable to Enron employees
through normal expense report procedures.  Specifically, the new fee
structure is based on zero-commission contracts for tickets purchased from
Enron's preferred carriers.  The fee schedule for all airline tickets for
Enron travel is as follows:

$30 - Domestic tickets with or without upfront discount
$30 - International tickets without upfront discount
25% of Savings, capped at $175 - International tickets with upfront discount
$15 - Southwest Airlines and ClickTrip Reservations, Hotel/Car Only Bookings

The savings to Enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees
that are charged.  For example, Enron's average ticket prices are $589
domestic and $2207 international (after discounts). Enron's average savings
are $144 domestic and $587 international (before fees).  The savings are
more than three times the per ticket fee!

If you are accustomed to booking your own travel online, you may continue to
do so by booking through ClickTrip.  ClickTrip is the only online booking
tool that allows access to Enron's negotiated discounts.  Ticketing through
ClickTrip also bears a smaller fee of $15 if no agent assistance is
necessary.  There is no charge to look at schedules.   ClickTrip is
available 24 hours a day and may be accessed through Enron's intranet site
<http://travel.enron.com> or via the Internet site
<http://www.resassist.com/enron/>.  ClickTrip is also a useful tool for
checking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status.  To check upgrade
status or to review a ticketed itinerary, simply click the Check My Trip
button on the ClickTrip home page and fill in your name and Amadeus locator
number (provided at the top of your itinerary).  A user log-in may be
obtained by contacting Alliance at 713 328-5100.

If your office location, phone number or any profile information has
changed, please notify us by return email.  A profile form is attached if
you prefer to fax the information to Alliance at 713 328-5600 or if you are
a new traveler wishing to set up a profile.

We at Alliance are proud of our 17 year association with Enron and dedicated
to ensuring you of the best possible service at the most economical price
for all of your travel needs.  We have a highly trained and experienced
staff working on Enron's account and we look forward to providing you with
continued service for years to come.
If you have any questions regarding any of the changes mentioned, or wish to
discuss specific details relating to your corporate travel policies, please
call me 713 328-5139, or email lhinson@allianceworldwide.com

Had some problems getting this interconnect on rate today. Steve Richards went out and got the flow contol valves to where they will operate, however, we cannot change flow direction from Gas Control. If the direction needs to be changed, someone will have to go out and do the valve changing manually.

Ben, per your request:

The 30"" valves on the lateral were confirmed to be full open.  Scrubber off the Ignacio lateral located in the Blanco Hub was dry.  Siphons on meter tube headers (down stream of scrubber) were also dry.  Plates on El Paso (refer to George Kneisleys e:mail earlier today) have been experiencing liquid build up.  No differential across scrubber into Blanco Hub.

I did some checking on the Ignacio Lat. The Block valve 111-2 at MP 17 was full open at 953 psig at 09:45. I then drove 
back to the tie-end at La Maquina And checked the pressure there it was 951 psig I then called Jesse with Gas Control
and had him check his screen and it also read 951.From there drove to La MaQuina meter sta and all The manual valves
where open and the pressure was the some. AT Bloomfield the pressure up stream of the scrubber was 900 and down 
stream was 900 no DP there we were flowing about 392 mmcf with the back pressure set at 900. At Bloomfield Gas Control 
can control the flow as well as the pressure on that meter run for North West .Are as we call it the 30"" check  the back pressure changes all the time depending on how much flow El Paso needs . I hope this will answer so questions if not 
fill free to call the station and we will be happy to help.
                                                                                                           Thanks C.Gaston

Subject:	FW: La Plata to Bloomfield

San Juan, please review the attached notes below.  

Team:
1)  Per Bens request, verify the full open position of the 30"" mainline valve at MP 17.  Also, verify full open position of the old 30"" Northwest block valve feeding the Blanco Hub.  
2)  Please provide an update of your recent findings with regards to liquid build up on the orfice plates at the El Paso delivery.  Second, provide any information that you may have with regards to liquids received off the Igancio lateral at the Blanco Hub.  
3)  Please verify the differential across the inlet scrubber into the Blanco Hub.  

Ben
2)  All pressure transmitters are calibrated at a minimum on a monthly basis (during customer witness testing) so, the readings that you are currently monitoring are accurate.  Also, there are no low spot drains or siphons for which to verify liquid buildup other than at the delivery/outlet points on this system to El Paso and the Blanco Hub.

San Juan team members, Blackie Foutz or Chris Gaston (505-632-3876) can be contacted for further details on this system.

Also, La Maquina & Jack Rabbit are both downstream of the 30"" mailine valve at MP 17.  The meter station, 1880' of pipe, check and block valve at La Maquina are owned by WFS.  Also,  if I remeber correctly, the grade covering the 1880' of piping from the meter station to the 30"" lateral is fairly flat.   However, I could be mistaken as it's been awhile since I've been to that location.

The continuing deterioration of the efficiencies on the Ignacio line is of grave concern to us.


Please:
1)	check the valves around the la Maquina-Bloomfield segment to make sure they are fully open
2)	let's take pressure readings in that section for re-calibration of the segment.
3)	Let's check for the presence of liquids particularly at the low elevation spots.

Thx
ben

Bob,

Researching the drawings for the La Plata to Bloomfield piping et. al., there is a mainline block valve on the 30"" line at approximately mile post 16.84 (between Jack Rabbit and La Maquina).  From the La Maquina meter station, there is ~1880' of 20""  0.281 wall pipe.  The La Maquina station consists of two 12"" orifice tubes, with a 10"" (V-Ball?)  flow control upstream of the meter tubes.  Each meter tube has 12"" ball isolation valves both up and downstream of the orifice element.  Run switching occurs on run 2 on the upstream side.  The two tubes common into a 20"" header that becomes the line to the 30"".  Where the 20"" ties into the 30"", it appears there is a 20"" check valve and 20"" ball valve. From the alignment sheet, there appears to be some major elevation changes between the meter station and the pipeline.  We have a reasonable elevation profile on the 30"" line.

George, do you have a site elevation for the La Maquina site (Meter number 0010162)?

Ben,

There seems to be a restriction of some sort, and a substantial one at that, on the Ignacio lateral between the La Maquina input and Bloomfield.  Using historical and current SCADA data, researched by Gary Choquette, the pressure loss in this 10.56-mile segment is, on a per mile basis, more than twice that experienced in the first 21 miles from La Plata to La Maquina.

The restriction may be the result of liquids settling into a low spot.  The question is where would the liquids come from, it is hard to imagine the source is the La Plata compressor units...maybe from the La Maquina input or it may simply be a pinched valve in that segment.  Is there a mainline valve in the 10.6 miles of pipe?

If there is any hope of getting the flow through the La Plata to Bloomfield segment up to 705 MMcfd, the restriction in the La Maquina to Bloomfield segment will have to be addressed and identified.

I would suggest that a check of any valves within that segment are full open.  If this is not the cause, then take actual calibrated pressure readings from La Plata to Bloomfield to confirm whether or not the problem is real or imagined.  What are your thoughts?   

Bob

Subject:	Griffith Interconnect Pressure

I'm going to try and clear this up:

Robert Francen (928-226-2219) with Citizens called about the Griffith interconnect a couple of weeks ago.  He made a request that we configure our flow control valve with a pressure control over-ride and reduce the supply pressure to the Citizens station supplying the Griffith power plant.  Although I know the RTU has this capability, I told Robert that I would have to check with our Tech folks to see if we had this capability.  My concern was that by lowering our supply pressure to Citizens it would make it easier to switch or split flows to the power plant with El Paso.  El Paso's supply pressure runs a couple of hundred pounds lower than TW's in this area and they cannot get in to Citizens with incurring huge swings at Citizens and shutting TW in currently.  So, simply stated, I did not want to proceed without direction from Marketing or Gas Control.  If I remember correctly when I called and discussed this issue with you a couple of weeks ago, we were in agreement not do reduce the pressure supply to Griffith but, you were going to communicate this with them.  I am still getting calls from Robert and I'm not sure how to handle his request at this point.  

Please do not confuse this issue with the Batching valve that is currently out of service.  Also, do not confuse with Choquettes request to provide pressure over-ride at this point as that can be done to provide steady state pressure with a flow control over-ride without reducing supply pressure dramatically to this interconnect point.  (However, there is the concern that if we install pressure control with a flow control over-ride that we put ourselves in the position of reducing this supply pressure over time and then getting into competing issues with El Paso.  

I do not care how we configure this point.  However, again it could have implications for marketing and gas control so, I prefer that you all make that call.

Subject:	Re: Questar IC

Earl, we noted in a weekly report that this IC was approved for construction with a May 1st startup date.  [Chanley, Earl]  David, the IC has not been approved to date, a PA has been submitted and is being routed for approvals.   We gave a heads up to Jerry and Darryl that a potential interruption to flow could occur in the near future as a result of tie-ins for this IC.  Jerry and Darryl then requested that the tie-ins be made during our LaPlata outage which is a three day outage during April 2nd, 3rd, & 4th.   [Chanley, Earl]   Talked with Darrel and the Hot tap date will coordinate with other outage of April 2, 2002. Line pressure has to be lowered to 702# for welding.  I asked that Jerry and Darryl discuss the time frame of tie-ins for Questar with you, as I could not say one way or the other if you could mobilize by then.  [Chanley, Earl]   trying to get material ASAP for tap. Working on details of who buys material for the IC. Will know more next week.  

Jerry/Darryl, I did however, discuss with the Team to determine if the tie-ins occured during the same time frame as the La Plata outage, what would be the impact to manpower and scheduling of tasks at La Plata.  The Team committed to the tie-ins during the same time frame but will be asking for 4 days of down time at La Plata now versus the 3 days origianlly requested.  They will look at options such as contract labor, support team, etc... to see if they can squeeze this back to three days, but it will be a few weeks before that information is communicated.   [Chanley, Earl]  David, E&C will have the contract crews, Inspector and others in place to lessen the impact to their schedule.   [Chanley, Earl]  The team choice to extend the outage should not be based on the tap as E&C will supply any support needed, if the team has concerns, contact me and we will work them out.  

Chris Gaston will be the team point of contact for the Questar tie-ins...  Blackie Foutz will be the Team point person for measurment related issues related to design/installation.

Earl, can you provide the team with the work order number so that payroll can be charged as they become involved?   [Chanley, Earl]  As soon as it is approved and funded.  Also, can you provide the tentative date of commissioning the interconnect so that we can insure George Kniesley is available to participate along with the team.   [Chanley, Earl]  IN service is requested for May 1, 02, but will know more after meeting with Questar on who will purchase material and build.  
 
Team, charge time to the work order only as support is requested from E&C and/or is necessary as part of start up and commissioning.  

If I can do anything to help, please give me a call...

Jack Ohearn with Questar and Roswell E&C will meet at the Bloomfield station on 2-20-02 @ 8:00 am to determine where the interconnect will be located, TW or Questar right of way. All of the details of the IC are being worked out and TW is to own and operate at this time. Locations, design, who is to construct and equipment are issues being resolved at this time. 
If you have any questions, please let me know next week. 
I'm not sure of who the team contact will be on this project, but if the team or contact has other commitments, this meeting is to resolve the location and the team's impute is welcome.

"FW: Enron golf team","
FYI,
I went to the team meeting and it really sounds like a lot of fun. Let Eric Johnson know by the first of next week if you are interested.

Jerry

Hello everyone!  We are looking to form a team (or teams) of Enron employees and spouses to participate in a new golf league, the inaugural season of the Corporate Team Golf Cup - Houston!

Some of you received this e-mail because you participated in the Enron-sponsored golf league in the past.  We thought you would be interested in joining us this season!    Please pass this on to other golfers you know within Enron that may not have received this e-mail.

The new league is sponsored by the Southern Texas PGA.  The purpose of the league is to create an environment for corporate personnel to network, interact, and build friendships and business relationships through a competitive and social golf program.

The league will include companies (teams) from the Houston area.  A few of the companies that have already committed to play are PWC, Reliant, Compaq, and Texaco.  Each team will have eight (8) players at each event and will compete once a month against another team.  The inaugural season will include six (6) monthly events plus a tournament for the finalists in November.

The deadline for entering our team(s) is coming up.  Please let me know if you are interested by Tuesday 3/19/02.  We will have a meeting later that week to answer questions and to sign everyone up.  Please don't hesitate to call or e-mail me should you have any questions.

I have also attached a flyer for you to pass on to people at other companies who may be interested in forming their own team.

Come join us -- we're looking forward to a great season!

"Requested pressure cut at Citizens Griffith TW Interconnect","
Citizens had concerns about the amount of noise and vibration at our Citizens Plant Station and has recently had an expert on this subject visit the site and take measurements.  The preliminary report indicates that the current configuration could potentially fail at full load conditions with a inlet pressure exceeding 740 psig.  Since Citizens does not want to limit the capacity of the power-plant, we are asking that your delivery pressure be temporarily reduced to 700 psig.
I have attempted to document the different operation modes that we have observed your station operating under along with any back-ground information that I was able to document. As discussed, in the design phase of this interconnect, I was informed that batching would only occur under low flow conditions, and do not understand the benefit of batching in the manner that was done earlier this year.
Per our customers request (Griffith Energy) Citizens installed equipment capable of measuring down to extremely low flow rates that include three measurement runs.  A 10"" Instrument Ultrasonic, a 4"" Invensys Turbine meter, and a 2"" Instrumet Rotary meter.  Although I questioned this requirement at the time, the low flow condition occurs so rarely, it is inconsequential.
I have analyzed our log files for the month of November (11/1/01-12/6/01) and found that the only time the smaller runs operate is momentarily as the power plant starts up.  The following volumes are accumulated totals per run for this time period.
Run Size        TW      Flow (Mcf)     Percent of Flow                              EPNG    Flow (Mcf)        Percent of Flow 
2""                                   107.9              0.0089%                          0.2            0.0018% 
4""                      1,280.8              0.1059%                                                 2.1                  0.0153%
10""                         1,208,076.9            99.8852%                                          13,714.4                99.9829%
My point is that in the event that you do not feel comfortable in setting your actuated valve immediately downstream of your flow control valve to take Citizens' requested pressure cut, consider temporarily using the flow control valve as  pressure control.  The month of November included considerable power-plant testing, and therefore the above numbers are higher that during commercial operation.
When TW found it's in a difficult situation in regards to finding a solution to measuring a low flow (which appears to be erroneous information), Citizens worked with you in good faith.  All we are asking is the same in return.

"San Juan control modifications for fuel savings","I have spent a significant amount of time reviewing the operations and SCADA on the San Juan lateral over the last couple of weeks.  I've uncovered some issues that could significantly reduce fuel consumption on this system.  Listed in order of priority are:

Resolve La Plata Unit #2 flame-out problem.  Currently this unit is running in manual control to limit flame-outs.  This prevents the station from running with only one unit at low flow conditions.  According to the La Plata team, this will require the replacement of the fuel control valve and unit control software changes.  Running in the manual mode is costing an additional 550 MSCF/D in fuel plus the extra O&M costs associated with the fired hours on unit #1.  The team is expecting the new fuel valve soon but anticipates that they will not get the necessary downtime to install the valve until after the end of the tariff months.  Due to the potential emissions issues associated with its current operating mode, we may have to expedite the modifications to this unit.
Auto calculate a suction pressure setpoint for La Plata.  There are three flow controlled interconnects on the suction side of La Plata.  Using the meter run pressures and/or the flow control valve position, we can maximize the suction pressure setpoint to achieve the interconnect flow rates.  The higher suction pressure reduces the power required at La Plata with an average expected fuel savings of 175 MSCF/D.
Auto calculate a suction pressure setpoint for the Bloomfield Low service similar to the La Plata modification recommended above.  Estimated fuel savings of 80 MSCF/D.
Modify the controls at Gallup to enable a quick turndown for a power peak.  Currently when a power peak is predicted, the Gas Control operators manually transmit a lower discharge pressure setpoint.  It may take a long time for the new setpoint to actually gain control of the unit.  The suggested modification would have the Peak Power alarm I calculate automatically retransmitted to the field and unit/station controls were modified to quickly ramp down the unit in a controlled manner (minimize recycle and prevent unit trips) to minimum power.  Gas Control could then send an override signal that would allow the unit to operate at higher loads if required.  Likewise, if my Peak Power alarm clears automatically, the unit would return back to its normal process setpoint conditions.  Note that if Gas Control overrides my alarm, the override needs to latch until my Peak Power alarm clears.  The suction and discharge setpoint rate ramp limiter logic should be modified to make them more responsive when they are far from the process values.  Bob McChane, Todd Ingles, and myself can develop this logic.
Modify the La Plata station control for improved load sharing.  Recommend the load share method be based on matching compressor flow range margins.  I will work with Todd Ingalls to develop the logic and code.  This control method will ensure both units are operating as close to their high efficiency point as possible and minimize surge recycle.
Modify the station control process setpoints logic at La Plata (Bloomfield, Bisti too?) to include rate ramp limiters.  Currently, when Gas Control transmits a new setpoint, the station accepts the new value and quickly changes operating conditions to try and reach the new setpoint.  However, these changes may be occurring too fast and may contribute to the flame-out problems.  Again, I will work w/ Todd to develop the controls to achieve this.

In addition, it appears that the Compressor Performance utility would be helpful for the operating personnel in determining when one unit could handle all the flows at La Plata.  I'll try and package a version that can be installed locally and send it to Todd  Ingalls.

Todd, I looked and I do not have a copy of the existing station control for La Plata.  Could you please zip it up and send it to me?

Additionally, I finally got a copy of the drawings for the Griffith Interconnect.  It appears our flow swings at this point can be reduced significantly by changing the operation of the flow control valve to a downstream pressure control valve with a maximum flow control override.  Todd, who is responsible for the programming of the RTU for this point?

The decision has been made based on the latest smartpig results that the operating pressure for the pipeline section from Station 8 to Station 6 is not to exceed 939 psi until the actual status of the pipeline can be evaluated based upon the smartpig information and any necessary repairs can be made.

Additionally, a conference call for Friday (2-15) at 2:PM CST has been established to initiate discussions regarding excavations and possible repairs that may be needed.  Conference number is 877-795-3687 Code 724709.

Everyone plz try to participate in this call if at all possible.

"RE: Schedule change request","Damn you are hard to catch on the phone...  I know we can do the maint. in March but like this past year they sold the fuel through March and as a result we had to wait until April to start the maint.  That is what I am concerned with.  Have we made a committment on this fuel figuring a projected rate (based on your numbers below) of a 1071 which we could not reach with maint in March.

It really doesn't matter if we have sold firm or not March is still available for maintenance, as we would do it through april, may or june.
To answer your firm question.  Jan. 02 1091, Feb. 1071. Mar. 1071, Apr. 1057, May 1057.  This is what I see right now you know how 
things change.

Just checking... In the previous two years we had sold firm through March which prevented us from performing maint. in the month of March.  So, my question:  Have we sold firm through March yet or is that month still available for maint. if we push this schedule up?  If I'm not making any sense give me a call.

Subject:	RE: Schedule change request


  Yes Ronnie, I would still like to do that for 2 reasons.

1.	It moves the overhaul on unit 401 into March, which is the same month we are doing the tie-ins at Station 1 and 3. And since there will be a flow restriction from those tie-ins we can coordinate the two outages together and save a little of the flow loss.
2.	Starting and finishing the overhauls earlier will keep us away from our summer comments, if there are problems or delays.    

       If  there are no objections, I will change the dates to the new schedule listed below.

Jerry, A while back you suggested moving the overhauls up at Station 4 to
March 1st, 2002. If its still works for you lets give it a try. The only
concerns at this time may be parts delivery time, but I think we will be
ok. The recommended outage dates are listed below. Let me know if this will
work for you. Thanks!

Ronnie........

401 start date 3-1-2002, Completion date 4-9-2001
402 start date 4-11-2002, Completion date 4-21-2001
403 start date 4-23-2001, Completion date 5-3-2001

Subject: A prayer for you


I said a prayer for you just now..... When you receive this e-mail just 
recite the following prayer. That's all you have to do. There is nothing 
attached. This is the power of prayer at work. 
Just send this to 4 people (including me) and see what 
happens on the fourth day. Do not break this, please. There is no cost, but 
lots of rewards. Let's continue to pray for one another. 
May today there be peace within you. May you trust God that you are exactly 
where you are meant to be. May you not forget the infinite possibilities that 
are born of faith. May you use those gifts that you have received, and pass

Jesus said, "" if you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you before my

This is the simplest test . . . if you Love God, and are not ashamed of all 
the marvelous things he has done for you, send this to ten people and the 
person who sent it to you!  Hebrews 13: 15 Through Jesus, therefore, let us 
continually offer to God a sacrifice of praise - the fruit of lips that 
confess his name.

Here is the file you sent me with the following changes:

1.  Question 1: added a comment line after the column headings explaining that Interruptible contracts may be extended from month to month unless terminated on 30 days' notice by either party.  Mary Kay thought we needed some explanation why those contracts showed termination dates in the past.  I eliminated this line, along with the headers, on the CD version of the file.

2.  Question 3:  I just changed the alignment on the text cells for the 3 comment records at the bottom from Centered to Left.

Gentlemen,
 I need to schedule 2 hrs. down time ( zero flow ) for sta. 010169-01 TW / TransColorado I/C ( Blanco Hub receipt ). Starting at 09:00 MST on 3-19-02.
We are going change out a 12"" turbine meter out, and visually inspect the meter tube. Rick Downey with Kinder Morgan is scheduling this with his people as well. We should be able to make up the noms. pretty easily, as they always have plenty of line pressure and lots of gas.
Thanks,

Subject:	Re: FW: Proposed Holcomb South Flow Test

Steve,

If I don't receive any major comments on my note, I'll set up a conference call for Monday, April 1 (really I will), to talk through converting to this configuration.  It may be done in stages, e.g. close the valve north of Mesa first, then north of Tate, then finally north of Finney 2.  There is some concern about moving liquids around when the flow is reversed.  Also April 2 is the target date, but there is nothing magic about it, if we need to slip back.

Finney 3 is one of the ""related issues"" to be resolved.  As you know, people have been working on a posting reminding everyone of our 950 BTU/SCF tariff requirement.  My understanding is Marketing would contact the Finney 3 shippers after the posting giving them a month to find someplace else for Finney 3.  I foresee during the test period that Finney3 would be subject to shut in.  With no Tekas, CIG would have to be about 35 MM/D to make 950 BTU east of Finney 3.  If CIG is too low, we would have to shut in Finney 3.  A variation on this is to lower the minimum operational BTU value to 925 BTU/SCF for the Burdett line.  This would lower the required CIG volume to about 20 MM/D.  It has been determined that 925 BTU gas would be workable for the Burdett loads that in the past have operated at 950 BTU for extended time periods.  Physically the gas would burn.  But a formal decision to operate at 925 BTU has not been made.

If anyone has any different/more current/better information on the BTU issue, please let me know.


John

Subject:	Proposed Holcomb South Flow Test

LD,

As we discussed at our 03/19/02 meeting, below is the proposed configuration for the April test flowing volumes south from Holcomb.


BACKGROUND

A background for those not at the meeting:  NNG Marketing is in discussions with Oneok about re-routing Rich stream gas in order to restart the Bushton Helium plant.  The proposal being pursued is to leave the higher CO2 CIG gas in the Burdett line and shift more of the remaining gas flow from the Burdett line to the Sublette-Mullinville line.  The Burdett line would then be routed to the Lean inlet at Bushton and Oneok would receive only the Mullinville volumes into the Rich inlet.  The Helium plant would operate on a reduced total volume, but would avoid receiving any higher CO2 gas.

Oneok has stated that about 260 MM/D of flow from Mullinville would allow them to operate their Helium plant.  To accomodate this the block valve north of Finney 2 would be closed routing all the Finney 2 and 4, Tate and Mesa volumes south to Hugoton.  At Hugoton this gas would be routed to the Oklahoma suction and compressed to Sublette.

To accomplish this, modifications would be made at the Sunflower meter/regulator station to allow operation at a lower inlet pressure.  Piping would be added to the Hugoton yard to route the Holcomb gas to the OK suction.  However, a temporary re-routing of gas using existing Hugoton yard piping was found.  This can only be done on a short term basis duing cool weather as it involves taking three dehy contactors out of service.

So the plan is to reroute this gas beginning April 2 and continue through the rest of the month.  This would also be communicated to Oneok, giving them an opportunity to test run their Helium plant on the lower volume, if they chose to.  If all related issues are resolved and an agreement is signed with Oneok, the piping modifications would be made in May.


PIPELINE CONFIGURATION

The schematics below utilize actual volumes from 03/19/02 in a model tuned to actual conditions.  The model utilizes 03/19/02 volumes, but has the block north of Finney 2 closed and the gas routed to the Hugoton Oklahoma suction.  Note the horsepower values in this schematic are not accurate.





Note that with these actual volumes and April ambient and ground temperatures, Fowler and Macksville do not run.  Finney 2 and 4 discharge around 235 PSIG; Tate is predicted at 205 PSIG.  BTU's from Finney 2 to Tate are at the Finney2/4 value of about 922 BTU, but are at 963 BTU at Tate.  Note also that BTU's on the Burdett line are good with 968 BTU east of Finney 3.  The Burdett line BTU's are of course contingent on adequate CIG volumes.


COMPRESSION CONFIGURATION

Below are the results of detailed compression calculations that I did.  I used actual suction temperatures most places and a couple of model predicted suction temperatures where I did not have actuals.  There is some uncertainty about the Hugoton Kansas compression as I may not have accounted for possible re-circulation flow routing correctly.  I still expect it to be workable though.

	


TEST DATA COLLECTION

We have compressor unit information available most places via SCADA.  For Finney 2, 4 and Tate it would be helpful if the teams could send average daily values for the units on, suction and discharge pressure, RPM and step.  They can be sent to me via email or FAX, 620-562-3511.  If operations are smooth after the first week or so, we could discontinue the data collection.


These are engineering numbers and it is not an exact science.  But looking it all over I believe there is adequate margin for error and that this is a workable configuration.  If anyone sees real problems with it, please let me know.

FYI - Am working on a plan for pressure sweeping the Hugoton to Holcomb line, tentatively planned for this Wednesday.

Thanks,


John

We have compressor unit information available most places via SCADA.  For Finney 2, 4 and Tate it would be helpful if the teams could send average daily values for the units on, suction and discharge pressure, RPM and step.  They can be sent to me via email or FAX, 620-562-3511.  If operations are smooth after the first week or so, we could discontinue the data collection.


These are engineering numbers and it is not an exact science.  But looking it all over I believe there is adequate margin for error and that this is a workable configuration.  If anyone sees real problems with it, please let me know.

FYI - Am working on a plan for pressure sweeping the Hugoton to Holcomb line, tentatively planned for this Wednesday.

Thanks,


John

"Potential sale of Gomez lateral pipe","Dear Team--

	We are evaluating the potential sale of TW's existing 20-inch diameter Gomez lateral in Pecos and Ward County, Texas and have executed a confidentiality agreement with the proposed buyer (Pioneer Gas Pipeline).  The buyer would like to begin the due diligence process as early as possible and has asked to review  info related to the following:

	1) Maintenance records for last 3 years
	2) right-of-way / easement agreements

The potential benefits to TW of this transaction include 1) monetizing an asset that today is generating zero value and 2) creating a new source of gas supply into TW from the buyer.

Questions I have are:

	a) Can we designate a ""point"" person from the Monahans Team that I can coordinate with and who would that be?
	b) Where / who has the records & documents for the items above?

Your timely response is greatly appreciated.  Please coordinate with me all questions / concerns.  I ask that no information (verbal or written) be passed to any interested outside party without prior clearance with me.   

thanks for your help!!  I can be reached in Houston at 713-853-5559.

"Texas Monthly November 2001: How Enron Blew It","
How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron. 
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me."" 
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started. 
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985. 
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 
You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.
""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.
""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""

Subject:	FW: Farmer's Ag POI 78110

Today we opened the valve to the Farmer's Ag Hancock, Minnesota corn dryer. It is on the Benson Branchline, POI 78110. The procedure on this facility is as follows: When we approach our minimum pressure at Benson (350 psi or less), we will call the two people listed below, day or night, and let them know we are shutting the valve. We should not re-open again until we are comfortable with the pressures. This facility is 100% interruptible and should be shut-in any time we are concerned about the Benson Pressure. As you can see, this is a Utilicorp customer, not a Minneagasco customer, so you should not communicate with Minnegasco concerning the operation of this plant. Be SURE to log all activities concerning the valve operation and who you communicated with when you shut or open the valve. As always, we also need to work with Minnegasco as well when pressure problems occur, about cutting back their load as well, but this corn dryer should be in the first call. thanks. sj

"Sun Devil Pipeline storage service","Hi Steve and Bob, Happy New Year!!

Steve, based on our meeting in Houston, I met with our engineering and operations folks to discuss the possibility of putting together a new firm (or limited firm) Park N Ride storage service on the pipeline project.  Everyone agreed it is likely doable under certain conditions not the least of which is FERC approval.  The question I have for you is: how much volume and for how long a period?

For example, on any given day, assuming there is no Copper Eagle storage available, it will likely be easier to borrow (ride) gas off the system than to park gas on it.  I think this was your greater concern.  

In your ideal world, how much volume would you like to be able to pull off Sun Devil say if your MDQ was 100,000?  Would you want an additional 25,000/day, more or less? and for how long?  Also, how much would you want to Park on the system and for how long?  For purposes of evaluation, assume the cost would be significantly less than a storage option.

If you give me some parameters, we will build a service offering that meets your needs as close as possible.  

I will be out of the office on Friday 1/4 but look forward to hearing from you early next week.

Best Regards,
Kevin Hyatt

"Griffith Interconnect Pressure","I'm going to try and clear this up:

Robert Francen (928-226-2219) with Citizens called about the Griffith interconnect a couple of weeks ago.  He made a request that we configure our flow control valve with a pressure control over-ride and reduce the supply pressure to the Citizens station supplying the Griffith power plant.  Although I know the RTU has this capability, I told Robert that I would have to check with our Tech folks to see if we had this capability.  My concern was that by lowering our supply pressure to Citizens it would make it easier to switch or split flows to the power plant with El Paso.  El Paso's supply pressure runs a couple of hundred pounds lower than TW's in this area and they cannot get in to Citizens with incurring huge swings at Citizens and shutting TW in currently.  So, simply stated, I did not want to proceed without direction from Marketing or Gas Control.  If I remember correctly when I called and discussed this issue with you a couple of weeks ago, we were in agreement not do reduce the pressure supply to Griffith but, you were going to communicate this with them.  I am still getting calls from Robert and I'm not sure how to handle his request at this point.  

Please do not confuse this issue with the Batching valve that is currently out of service.  Also, do not confuse with Choquettes request to provide pressure over-ride at this point as that can be done to provide steady state pressure with a flow control over-ride without reducing supply pressure dramatically to this interconnect point.  (However, there is the concern that if we install pressure control with a flow control over-ride that we put ourselves in the position of reducing this supply pressure over time and then getting into competing issues with El Paso.  

I do not care how we configure this point.  However, again it could have implications for marketing and gas control so, I prefer that you all make that call.

"Updating Capacities","
After talking with Terry, Darrell, and the team, the following procedures have been developed so that each team member is consistent and all pertinent information is properly documented.

Darrell is going to set the Socal Capacity in CAS to its Operational Capacity (850000), therefore, from now on we should only update the Socal window in TMS, and opt not to send the capacity from TMS to CAS when asked.  In addition, we should continue to update the comments section in CAS each cycle for the Socal Window
For all other points, when updating Capacities in TMS, the changed capacity should be sent to CAS only if it is a change in Operational Capacity.  If we are updating for any other reason, (flow rate etc...) those capacities should not be sent back to CAS.
In conclusion, from now on we will only update capacities in TMS and we will only send changes to CAS or make changes in CAS if there is a change in Operational Capacity, which will probably be a decision made by Darrell.  The Socal Capacity in CAS and online is 850000 however we will continue to document the Window in the CAS Comments, and update it in TMS.

These procedures will be effective for the Timely of Gas Day 10/25/01.

If you have any questions, please ask me.

Thanks!

Subject:	Bloomfield La Plata Check Measurement pressure loss

I got a call from Jeff Greider at Bloomfield.  Bob and I asked him to track down the pressure differences between the El Paso Blanco and the La Plata Check measurement.  Jeff measured several pressures on the La Plata check measurement facility.  He found 875 psi at the scrubber inlet (which was about 1 psi lower than SCADA showed for El Paso Blanco), 872 at the scrubber outlet, 868 downstream of the T strainer, and 864 at the meter.  It appears there is about 3 psi loss across the scrubber, 4-5 psi across the T strainer, and 4 psi across the straightening vanes.  

I asked Jeff to pull and inspect the screen in the T strainer and look at the straightening vanes.  We may want to get a spare gasket and basket prior to the inspection.  I will check w/ the manufacture to see what we have and what is available.  It is possible the existing screens/straitening vanes are partially plugged.  We may also consider replacing the existing screen with a larger mesh size.

For pipeline tuning purposes, it appears we should be using the El Paso Blanco pressure at the El Paso interconnect rather than the Bloomfield suction pressure.

Attached is the preliminary January California monthly report for your review...our last one, yeah!!!

TK - Please review/verify the rates that I have highlighted in pink.

I have already spoken with Terry regarding 3 days where I noticed discrepancies between total scheduled in TMS vs website posting and have determined the correct number to report.  All other data looks very similar to previous reports filed.

Please provide any comments or updates that may be necessary by COB February 22nd.

"Albuquerque Cross Functional Meeting","I made room reservations for the 3 of us on November 5 only at the Sheraton Uptown (505-881-0000).  The rooms are not guaranteed past 6:00 pm.  Our confirmation numbers are as follows.

		Ron M.		118587
		Darrell S.	118588
		Dennis A.	118590

I checked on flights and the best bet is a 2:30 pm flight arriving Albuquerque at 3:36 pm (next one wouldn't get in until 7:37 pm).  Flights back to Houston are 2:40 pm and 4:30 pm arriving at 5:37 & 7:37 pm respectively.  I vote for the 4:30 pm flight to make sure we don't run short on time.  

LET ME KNOW ASAP MONDAY TO BOOK.  Right now the fare is  $156.25 & non-refundable.  Not sure what it will be Monday.

Kim,

I don't know your plans in and out of Albuquerque so I didn't book a room for you.  I thought you were headed elsewhere from Albuqueruque.  Let me know if you want me to do something on arrangements.

Ron M.

"FW: SoCal - November 1 Changes","            We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they
	     only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can 
	     call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and 
	     Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact
	     to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

"FW: preliminary report","
Attached is a copy of the preliminary report that  recommends that the inlet pressure to Citizens ""Griffith Plant"" Station be  limited to 740 psig.  Note that this is only a preliminary report that  Citizens is reviewing.  Some of our ""reviewers"" are on vacation, and have  held up the process of getting this report finalized.
 
Since  I was temporarily assigned to another position during the time that gas was  introduced to this line, I have asked my employee Martin Conboy to create a log  of events on how these stations had been operated.  I will send it to you  later today.  
 
Can  you have David Roensch review to see if anything is missing.  I feel that  it is a good idea to document the different operation modes with results prior  to agreeing on any further changes.
