Subject:	Griffith Gas & Electric Estimate - Friday Sept. 14, HE 8:00 to Saturday Sept 15, HE 7:00

This schedule is for performance testing as follows:

1) Cold Start Test
     Must bring the plant up to Base Load in less than 8 hours.
     Scheduled to start both CT's during HE 8:00

2) Steam Turbine Trip Test:
     Scheduled to occur in HE 17:00 then bring CT back up to base.

3) Operation at Minimum Load:
     Scheduled to occur  HE 21:00 to HE 22:00

Special Request to DETM and WAPA for today to permit Griffith to change
plant output without constraint as long as we strive to make the average MW
shown on this schedule for each hour.  (This has been approved by Cal
Ingram of WAPA)

Note: If something happens and BVZ cannot stay on this schedule, then DETM
can again call for limits on the timing of ramp up or down as required.

Becky:
There will be a meeting at 3:00 PM MST today to update our startup plan.
My predicion this morning was that we would not need gas before Monday,
morning July 30, but there is a slim chance that startup may occur late
Sunday, July 29.

The good news is that the gas requirement for the startup day will be less
that 10,000 MMBTU's.  Can we take that much on Sunday if they get ahead of
schedule?

By copy to Kim:  We do not expect to make any MW on the startup day. In
fact after the Steam Blow activity, we will shut down for several hours to
put the steam piping back in an operational state.

Ken

Darrell is changing the capacity for the Gas Day of the 18th through the weekend. We have contacted the operator and we are expecting a call back to instruct us for Gas Day 10/17 confirmations. We need ensure that the gas remains confirmed down through the ID2 cycle.

I thought you might find this interesting.

Next, was a presentation by Staff on the California Update. Staff gave some interesting statistics: consumption grew 16% in 1995-2000 while capacity increased by 3%. In-state capacity will be insufficient to meet peak demand. Within the 2001-2006 new generation of 3200 MW will come on line in 2001; 6500 MW will be under construction and 15,000 MW has been either tabled or cancelled. Hydropower accounts for 20-40% and will play a significant role in the next five years. This places California at the mercy of snow pack conditions for up to 40% of its requirements. Last year the snow pack was 64% of typical and this year it is at 130%. Natural gas accounts for 15% of the state's needs; therefore, 85% is imported from outside the state. (47% from Southwest; 28% Canada and 10% from the Rocky Mountain pipes).Gas fired generation will decline in the next five years according to staff for three reasons:
new generation facilities coming on line
hydro will be at normal or above levels
neighboring states will sell into California
If there are surprises such as short-term price volatility, economic growth outpaces projects, low hydro conditions, energy conservation declines, California will experience similar conditions to last year.

"Agave","Just in case you receive a call from either JB or David.  They were called yesterday and I spoke with Neal and let them
know they were going short again after we cleaned up their current imbalance over last weekend and Monday.  
They were short for Wednesday's gas day.  My conversation was with Neal that they make adjustments to their nominated 
volumes or turn on more gas.  It does not appear they did either one.  I will call them this morning and let them know that 
they have until ID-1 to turn on more gas or cut their noms or TW will be cutting their market for ID-1.  Maybe this is a 
good opportunity to discuss park and ride again.  TW covered 7,000 mmbtu/d of Markets according to the scada numbers
that we see.

Let me know if you agree.

Subject:	TW Allocations

When doing allocation process and we allocate points or groups on the Timely, Evening, or Non-Grid. 
We allocate with the capacities that are loaded from CAS.  When allocating points or groups that have
not previously been allocated on any of the previous cycles during ID-1 or ID-2 we need to use the flow rate calculation.
.
Example :  Allocations are as follows

The only point to be exempt from this method should be Socal Needles because of their window issue
Timely:        M/L Thoreau West System                1093.000  (capacity)
                   I/B Link                                             700.000  (capacity)
                   Laplata/Ignacio                                  500.000  (capacity)
                   Socal Needles                                   775.000  (Window)
Evening:      Same sequence 
Non-Grid:     Same sequence

ID-1or ID-2:  Same sequence shows up to be allocated.  
                   Since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse 
                   click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate.  The only time we should 
                   have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously
                   allocated.                   
             
 The reason for the change is we have recieved more FERC data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes.
lets try this for a while and see how it is working.

Subject:	RE: West Texas Pool

500168 is a Bi-directional point and physically can flow both ways.  One Oak built a new delivery point with the capacity of 200,000
           and the other point that was a delivery only is still active.  The two I/C's go into different pressures into their system but physically
           located in the same yard.  TW, along with Marketing (Kevin Hyatt) asked to keep the same POI and asked to set this point
           up as a summation meter to make it easier for the customers to nom on both pipes.  Karen was involved in this point.
56943 is only a delivery only and is good for only displacement.
1635 is no longer a bi-directional point according to Will Fernandes on the Monahans team it is a delivery to NNG only.  He will
        send an e:mail.
The Burlington Jackrabbit I/C in San Juan:  That was Burlington's Plant and I/C.  They were the only shippers able to use that 
       point.  They are not using that point and they will get back with me and let us know if they want us to keep the point in active
       status.
If any other questions please call

POI 1635 is a bi-directional point but physically it only flows one way at this time.  I can change the indicator for TW in PLE, if that is what you are asking.
I'm not sure I understand what you are asking for on POI 56943.  Are you saying this point is valid for displacement and I should add it to the IT and SP displacement groups in PLE?  What does West Texas have to do with it??
POI 500168 is a delivery in PLE, not bi-directional.  If it physically does not flow both ways I can't change the indicator in PLE.  If you are scheduling due to displacement then it should be added to the displacement groups.

The following points need updating in PLE

1635 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE  as such to be picked up in TMS
56943 should be a displacement point on both IT and SP groups in West Texas
500168 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE as such to be picked up in TMS

Subject:	SoCal Needles ""Window"" allocation

	
	I would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the
	procedure Transwestern is using today for the SoCal Needles ""window"" allocation.

	Some of the questions being asked:

	1.  Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?

	2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary firm?

	3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?

	I am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well.  We are looking
	at Tuesday, July 24, at 9:00 a.m or Wednesday, July 25, 1:30 p.m.

	Please let Ava Garcia (713-853-5842) know which day is better for you.  Then we will
	get a room and let everyone know date and time.  

	Thanks. Lynn

Cleaning pigs are being run in Section 7 & 8 as gas flows allow.  Cleaning pigs will be ran in Section 5 during the week of Aug. 20th.  

Gallup - please notify Gary Choquette before and after each cleaning run and caliper run in Sect. 5 so he can check efficiencies.

Teams, please let me know who on your teams will be available for these caliper runs so I can set up support help as needed.  I know that Gallup will need 2 support people the week of Aug. 27th.

During the week of Sept. 10th there will be a TD Williamson representative on site to determine if Sections 7 & 8 are clean enough to smart pig.

Subject:	 MOPS Update



The South Central Team has been fielding several calls from customers regarding the status of MOPS, Cara and Chris were invited to conference with the Tivoli Area and the crew working on the leak.

The latest information as of 11:00 am Wednesday 2/13/02 is as follows:

Operations:
The earliest the MOPS system will be unavailable this Saturday 2/16/02 (  best estimate )

The diving crew has located the exact source of the leak, and they are continuing repairs.  Right now the weather condition's look favorable and the forecast predicts that the good conditions should continue.  The leak is located 160 feet below the surface which presents complications no matter the weather conditions.

At least one member of the South Central Team will listen in on the daily conference call (11:00 am Central Time) and will keep everyone updated; this should help improve the accuracy and timeliness of our information.

Scheduling:

Darrell will set the operational capacity to 0 through the 18th on the delivery locations. If the MOPS system come back on before that time the operational capacities can be brought up. This information is available on the bulletin board.

Remember to post as a FORCE MAJEURE on the allocations. If receipt points (ex:platform 762) update the point and their deliveries will be cut.  

Some customers have been calling and inquiring if they should nom. gas in the MOPS system. Noming gas is at the shippers discretion, as long as the system is down we will continue to confirm their gas to 0 and allocated the delivery points.   Please direct them to the bulletin board.  It is ok to let them know of our timeline, please stress that this is an estimate.  If you are not comfortable answering any question, please direct them to myself (5-2871), Chris (3-4826) Sherry (3-3063), or Bob Burleson (713-287-1049)

We will keep up updated as the MOPS situation continues. Cara will be on comp days Thurs and Friday-- Chris and Sherry will cover my desk and MOPS in my absence. 

Thanks,
Cara and Chris

The problem is we haven't ran a pig on these lines in years. In order to insure our pipeline integrity, we need to work through these obstacles and get something resolved. We know we have lots of liquid in these lines and need to proceed with pigging.

Please let me know what we need to do to get this accomplished.

I have changed the point / group lookup when posting TW notices through the Informational Postings Administration Utility.  It now takes the group information from the CAS system instead of PLE.  Please take a look at it to make sure it looks right.

Go to <http://172.30.200.203/ebbadmin/notices/default.htm> and log on as ""ebbadmin"",""august2000"".  Go to enter a new TW allocation and press the ""POI/Lateral"" button from the notice detail window.  The point information is now taken from the new PLE system and the group information is now taken from the new CAS system.

In early June 2001, GPM/Duke Energy informed me of the planned shut in for
maintenance on your processing plant in western Oklahoma. The planned
maintenance was supposed to be for the period of 6/12/01 thru 6/29/01. On
6/28/01 I received notice that the shut in would continue until 7/9/01 due
to ""waiting on parts/material""
On 7/8/01 I received a notice that the shut in would continue until 7/13/01
due to ""waiting on parts/material"". On 7/10/01 I recieved a notice that the
shut in would continue until 7/18/01 due to ""waiting on parts/material"".
When I checked as to the status of the project early the morning of 7/18/01,
I found that the shut in would continue until 7/27/01 due to "" waiting on
parts/material"".

When is the parts/material ever going to arrive?

Was this a planned shut in?

This has turned out to be very, very, costly to your customers. Are their
any plans for any compensation to them?

Phil I just got off the phone with Arnold and we have been advised that in the morning around 5 o'clock eastern time is the earliest that Alstrom will have information for us. From talking with Arnold, Alstrom has to get permission from England before they can give us approval to pull the unit. Since the unit is still under warranty we'll need to wait on directions from Alstrom. The team is doing more testing with Alstrom during this time to try and figure out how much damage the unit has.

We do have Norm Spalding's group lining up a contractor to assist in pulling the unit and transporting it for us. I'll keep everyone undated as soon as we get more information.

Steve here's where we are on the Gallup Compressor. Part of the stator is damaged and we're not sure if it can be repaired in place at this time. This will be decided sometime this morning and I'll let you know. If the stator cannot be repaired in place it will have to be pulled and returned to the factory. If this happens we'll be down for (I'm guessing on this) but from past experience it will be two weeks or more. I'll be at the Gallup site this morning.

I just finished talking to Bill. He said that his brother Louis is not giving up and neither ae the doctors. Bill said that Louis can hear them talk to him and that he responds to feel, though Louis is still in critical condition. Bill said that the Lubbock Fire Department has been very supportive with food and beverages. I ask that your thoughts and prayers be with the "" Jones"" family and we will keep you all updated as time goes by. Bill also said that visitation to see Louis has been very limited.   


Food For Thought-------Some jobs treaten or take our retirements, and some jobs treaten or take our lives. Now that we know, the kind of cards that life can deal to

Randy
Our thruput this week at P-3 has been 200mmcf/day. We are running #5 and we have 2,3 and 4 shut down.  #5 is able to move 200mm, but if we lose #5 for whatever reason, 2,3, and 4 together would not be able to make the 200mm order.
P-2 cannot help us with suction pressure because of the pressure restrictions on the 24"" at Canyon, and #1 is in PHFFU and I'm told needs a Major OH if we did take it out of PHFFU.  
If the 200mm orders continue we may need to take #1 out of PHFFU and have it repaired.

1)  After testing is completed for the day, we are showing Both Units

DETM can schedule more or less than the 463 MW in Real Time, depending on
the market and gas control agreement.
2) OK to shut off one CT rather than operate both at reduced load.

They are flying a motor specialist in from England, but he will not arrive until 7:00 PM Friday. At the present time Alstom is mobilizing IRS from Farmington, New Mexico to assist with the removal of the motor. The motor weighs nearly 35 tons, so permits, a crane and roof removal will be required. They plan to truck the motor back to Farmington for further analysis. They will then determine the repair process. I have set up a conference call for 1:00 PM Central time today, to allow everyone the opportunity to voice any concerns and get the latest updates from John and Alstom. The conference number is 877-795-3687 access code 691205.  I welcome all help and participation.  Rick

Phil I just got off the phone with Arnold and we have been advised that in the morning around 5 o'clock eastern time is the earliest that Alstrom will have information for us. From talking with Arnold, Alstrom has to get permission from England before they can give us approval to pull the unit. Since the unit is still under warranty we'll need to wait on directions from Alstrom. The team is doing more testing with Alstrom during this time to try and figure out how much damage the unit has.

We do have Norm Spalding's group lining up a contractor to assist in pulling the unit and transporting it for us. I'll keep everyone undated as soon as we get more information.

Steve here's where we are on the Gallup Compressor. Part of the stator is damaged and we're not sure if it can be repaired in place at this time. This will be decided sometime this morning and I'll let you know. If the stator cannot be repaired in place it will have to be pulled and returned to the factory. If this happens we'll be down for (I'm guessing on this) but from past experience it will be two weeks or more. I'll be at the Gallup site this morning.

TW Red Rock Team: Just spoke with Byron Rance and his message should read as follows for the Tie-In Schedule.  (Station 2 was listed twice; the second listing for March tie-ins should be Station 3.)


After discussion with Arnold Eisenstein, the following are (very) tentative dates for tie ins.
 
Station 2, mainline, October 22, 2001, 4 days
Station 2, loop,  November 5. 2 days
 
Station 1, mainline, March 4, 2002, 4 days
Station 1, loop, March 13, 2002, 2 days
 
Station 3 , mainline, March 18, 2002, 4 days

Station 3 , loop, March 28, 2002, 2 days.

Subject: TW Capacity Affected for Red Rock Tie-ins 



The following volumes are capacities west of Station 1 that will result from tie-in construction work slated for the Red Rock expansion.  Tie-in assemblies will be required on both the Mainline and Loopline at stations 1, 2, and 3.  New block and side valve assemblies for new compressor and scrubbers will be installed on the suction side main and loop lines at each station.  The tie-in will entail blocking (isolating) a line segment within the station yard on the suction side (each line done separately) thus creating a dead leg back to the next upstream block valve crossover(s).  Hence, all of the flow will be forced into a single line when making tie-in on the adjacent pipeline line.  The result of forcing all volumes into a single line will produce greater pressure losses in the operating segment to the existing compression and reduce throughput due to lower suction pressure and respective horsepower limitations.  Discharge piping at the station having tie-in work will be unchanged regarding valving configurations.

Rich / Rick,

Operations & the Gas Controllers didn't know about this till yesterday, when alarms started to appear in Houston.
I'm not sure what is expected from operations. In the last paragraph of Gary's letter, he indicates shutting down
for 30 minutes, 7 times a month. Is that what he is saying? Let us know what you find out.

Thanks,
Korey

Subject:	FW: Gallup Peak Power Avoidance Data Points



We have added some point to the Scada database that are provided to us
by Gary Choquette's Peak Power Predictor.  His message below describes
their function better than I would.

I've listed the points below with their descriptions, alarm value(s) and
comment.

Although these points are listed with the other Analog/Discrete points,
they are not coming from the field RTU.  They will act like normal
points so it's easy to put them together.  For those using the intranet
""Adhoc"" reports, they will show up on that.  The key is that the
Discretes that we receive from Gary all end in "".CC"" and the Analogs end
in "".SC"".  We also try to include the (CLC) in the description to depict
that the information is coming from the Closed Loop Control Systems.


Register	Description				Alarm Value
Gary's Comments

GALP.1901.CC	Tri-State Data Old - site Unavail (CLC)	0 = Normal, 1 =
Alarm 		(can not retrieve data from Tri-States site)
GALP.1902.CC	Tri-State Calc Off-Line / Data Error (CLC) 	0 =
Normal, 1 = Alarm 		(utility is off-line or error in the
data)
GALP.1903.CC 	Tri-State Power Peak In Progress (CLC)	0 = Normal, 1 =
Peak 		(a power peak is currently in progress)

GALP.7901.SC	Probability % Today is Peak (CLC)     HI = 95  HIHI = 96
A number between 0 and 100 indicating that today is likely to be a power
peak day.
GALP.7902.SC  Probability % Now is Peak (CLC)       HI = 95  HIHI = 96
A number between 0 and 100 indicating that a power peak is active now.
GALP.7903.SC	Peak Time (hour.min) (CLC)


Please let me know if you have any questions,

Thanks,

Angela Sayegh

We are about ready to install the unloader system at Station 8 to wrap up the automation project. We've been working on installing electrical and mechanical equipment without disabling the units. The valve people estimate 2 days per unit to install the valve actuators / unloaders and do some commissioning work. We just need one unit at a time.

Do we need to wait until the tarriff months are over? Jerry can you send me an outage request form?

Perhaps we should look at applying the drag reducer sooner.  With Bisti out of service, the drag reducer may give us some additional capacity.

What do you think?

FYI,
To stay out of conflict with some big EL Paso outages on the San Juan Lat. in May, we need to look at dates after May 21. Just a heads up.

All, 

Please review the attached interconnect agreement between Transwestern and Questar.  It is fully reimbursable by Questar.  This interconnect will be a delivery point to Questar in the Blanco Hub.  FYI, the section of pipe that we are connecting the interconnect to is owned by Transwestern and is not part of the jointly owned facilities of the Blanco Hub.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me to discuss.

Please reply back to me with any comments you may have.  I would like to send a draft to Questar on Tuesday morning, January 22, when we return from our holiday. 

Bill and Robert - please see the red-lined language addressing the tax reimbursement.  

Thanks for your time,

Kim.   X33098

Importance:	High

We just got off the phone with Alstom at 8:15 AM mountain time. John Manson is their service manager (412-967-7165). They are flying a motor specialist in from England, but he will not arrive until 7:00 PM Friday. At the present time Alstom is mobilizing IRS from Farmington, New Mexico to assist with the removal of the motor. The motor weighs nearly 35 tons, so permits, a crane and roof removal will be required. They plan to truck the motor back to Farmington for further analysis. They will then determine the repair process. I have set up a conference call for 1:00 PM Central time today, to allow everyone the opportunity to voice any concerns and get the latest updates from John and Alstom. The conference number is 877-795-3687 access code 691205.  I welcome all help and participation.  Rick

Subject:	Re: Gallup Compressor   

Phil I just got off the phone with Arnold and we have been advised that in the morning around 5 o'clock eastern time is the earliest that Alstrom will have information for us. From talking with Arnold, Alstrom has to get permission from England before they can give us approval to pull the unit. Since the unit is still under warranty we'll need to wait on directions from Alstrom. The team is doing more testing with Alstrom during this time to try and figure out how much damage the unit has.

We do have Norm Spalding's group lining up a contractor to assist in pulling the unit and transporting it for us. I'll keep everyone undated as soon as we get more information.

Thanks
Rich

Subject:	Gallup Compressor

Steve here's where we are on the Gallup Compressor. Part of the stator is damaged and we're not sure if it can be repaired in place at this time. This will be decided sometime this morning and I'll let you know. If the stator cannot be repaired in place it will have to be pulled and returned to the factory. If this happens we'll be down for (I'm guessing on this) but from past experience it will be two weeks or more. I'll be at the Gallup site this morning.

Subject:	Re: TW 1090 Project Schedule - Stations 1-4   

Darrell, unfortunately those who need to be at Station 4 are traveling back home from a PEP/PRC meeting we had in Albuquerque yesterday.  

Time frame to analyze the malfunction unloaders should include 3-8 hours travel for the Analyst and Division Mechanical Specialist.  Presently, outage was requested for Wednesday, June 6th, from 8am to 6pm.  Initially, that outage was to accommodate program changes to the Unit Control program.  This outage also needs to include unloader inspection, which means there will be substantial downtime of Unit 401during the day.  Do I need to provide other information because unloader inspection will be performed?

We found out last Thursday which unloaders were not functioning correctly.  I have asked Steve SanMiguel to circulate a memo detailing which unloaders are not operating correctly.  This memo should be sent today.

If outage arrangements, other than the filling made for June 6th, can be made earlier, please let me know as soon as possible.  I will be on the road headed back to Amarillo today.  My cell phone number is 806-886-8105.   Otherwise, I will assume we will be on schedule to do this work June 6th.

Thanks
Ken N Young

See attached Gas & Electric Estimate for Monday Aug. 6 HE  8:00 AM to
Tuesday Aug. 7 HE 7:00 AM.

Note: This schedule is optimistic.  We were supposed to do this much today
and were not able to achieve it due to several CT Trips.
For natural gas purposes, 60,000 MMBTU might be a better guess.

Station 9 will be unavailable until Monday afternoon, July 23rd.  The recycle valve is leaking gas and a
new valve is being shipped from Houston.  If you need a station you have to cycle station 8.

"Griffith Incident","Was on a conference call with Keith (TW gas control) and Ken Gruel (Griffith plant) Monday morning (September 3) 
concerning pressure drop at the Griffith plant.  It was discovered that the TW mainline setpoint had been changed to 
reflect the new order of 35,000 for the day.  The plant sent TW a schedule of hourly burns for the day.  They had 
intended to take their 24hr rate with-in 12 to 14hrs.  Asked Keith to raise the TW mainline setpoint to approximately 
120,000.  
After speaking with Keith off line and asked him to open the spead sheet from Ken on their takes asked him to figure
the hourly take for the 24 hrs.  He said that he made a mistake and didn't look at it.  The Griffith plant has been on line
since sometime in April and this should not be anything new to the gas controllers.
Asked Keith to call Ken back with Griffith and make sure they had Gas controls E:mail address and or fax number to send
any revisions.

Subject:	Westar Ward outage

Per our discussion concerning the needed outage at Westar Ward for aprox. 3 hours to dig up an underground check valve. We have scheduled to do this Thursday, Aug. 30th, at 08:00hrs. We do not know what kind of check valve is there, so the plan is to shut down the station, dig out the check valve, determine what type of check, and then put the station back in service until we can get the needed parts such as o-ring or top gasket for that type of check. The best case senario is that the check will be of the type that we can just pull the top, remove the clapper, replace top gasket and top, and put back in service. This will require another short outage as we can not have the parts on hand until we determine the type of check valve. Worst case senario is that the check type is not one that we can remove the clapper which will require us to obtain another type of check valve and replace the hole check which would again require another short outage. I will get back to you on scheduling the second outage as soon as possible. If you have any questions, give me a call.

Thanks,
Baker

George:

It's that time of the year again.  Thanks to your generous support and volunteer efforts in the past, we have raised over $187,000 benefiting Texas Children's Hospital Bone Marrow Transplant Unit through His Grace Foundation (HGF). HGF supplies gift baskets, meals, parking, and other services (laundry, grocery shopping, banking, post office, etc?) to patients and their families, including several Enron families in the past.

Your participation once again would go along way in making this year's tournament a success.  I hope you will consider playing or sponsoring in our 2001 tournament.

I have included a registration form as well as a flyer with more tournament details. 

Hope to see you on the Green!

Jim Coffey, Jr.

Subject:	Requested pressure cut at Citizens Griffith TW Interconnect


Citizens had concerns about the amount of noise and vibration at our Citizens Plant Station and has recently had an expert on this subject visit the site and take measurements.  The preliminary report indicates that the current configuration could potentially fail at full load conditions with a inlet pressure exceeding 740 psig.  Since Citizens does not want to limit the capacity of the power-plant, we are asking that your delivery pressure be temporarily reduced to 700 psig.
I have attempted to document the different operation modes that we have observed your station operating under along with any back-ground information that I was able to document. As discussed, in the design phase of this interconnect, I was informed that batching would only occur under low flow conditions, and do not understand the benefit of batching in the manner that was done earlier this year.
Per our customers request (Griffith Energy) Citizens installed equipment capable of measuring down to extremely low flow rates that include three measurement runs.  A 10"" Instrument Ultrasonic, a 4"" Invensys Turbine meter, and a 2"" Instrumet Rotary meter.  Although I questioned this requirement at the time, the low flow condition occurs so rarely, it is inconsequential.
I have analyzed our log files for the month of November (11/1/01-12/6/01) and found that the only time the smaller runs operate is momentarily as the power plant starts up.  The following volumes are accumulated totals per run for this time period.
Run Size        TW      Flow (Mcf)     Percent of Flow                              EPNG    Flow (Mcf)        Percent of Flow 
2""                                   107.9              0.0089%                          0.2            0.0018% 
4""                      1,280.8              0.1059%                                                 2.1                  0.0153%
10""                         1,208,076.9            99.8852%                                          13,714.4                99.9829%
My point is that in the event that you do not feel comfortable in setting your actuated valve immediately downstream of your flow control valve to take Citizens' requested pressure cut, consider temporarily using the flow control valve as  pressure control.  The month of November included considerable power-plant testing, and therefore the above numbers are higher that during commercial operation.
When TW found it's in a difficult situation in regards to finding a solution to measuring a low flow (which appears to be erroneous information), Citizens worked with you in good faith.  All we are asking is the same in return.

We did manage to avoid a complete plant outage, but the loss of gas
pressure yesterday morning was still a major upset.
CT #1 did trip off and then subsequently it took several hours of
struggling to get back to where we needed to be.  We didn't get back to
peak load until 2:00 PM in the afternoon.

I'll send you data on gas usage for yesterday by separate E-Mail for your
information.
Your assistance to get all the facts related to this event will be much
appreciated so we can learn how to not go there again.

We need to keep our communications open to the plant.  I know that
during their test mode they have had a variance in load projections.
Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady.

Ken,
Sorry about yesterday.  Thanks to your quick responce to our gas control
so we could correct the problem before the plant
went down.
If you have any more questions please call.

Good news for once.
I just spoke with Mike Blount with PII.  He indicated modification of their 1.5 D Tool is technically feasible and modifications can be completed in time to do both pig runs as originally scheduled (Sept. 18 and Sept 20).  He will let us know what this cost will be early next week.  (Maybe that's the bad news part.  I hope not).

Anyway, we're back on our original plan.

This was originally an Enron operated facility prior to selling of the gathering assets, which then became a Duke operated  facility. This point was re-activated in December,2000, without Measurement's knowledge, and apparently Market Services and others until April 2001. Had this been a new point, the current procedures for assigning station number, POI numbers, etc. would have probably prevented an incident such as this from occurring. Bottom line, in addition to generating PPAs and  distortion of the pipeline balance report by improper accounting of all receipts and deliveries, this has raised several areas of concern such as safety, transportation of unscheduled volumes, and others. We would like to schedule a meeting sometime in June (time and place to be announced),  to address procedurally, what all departmental requirements are for volumes to enter and exit our pipeline facilities. Please forward to contacts within you various organizations that you feel are necessary and critical to examination of current procedures, and possibly adoption of new ones, and let me know and I will add them to the distribution.
Thanks-

I called Ronnie and he said he remembers it but we had to assign a new number.  He didn't know what it is seeing as he's here in Houston.  I tried calling Sammy Williams, he too is in Houston.  I talked to Danny Garvin he only knew of one Duke connect and the name did not match up.  I also paged Randy Fitzgerald, he has not returned my call.  Karen is having the same problem getting hold of anyone.  I didn't see it on your first and finals either.  Anyway, if you know anything about this call Karen in the AM and let her know.

Subject:	TW imbal summaries

A couple of fyi items:

SoCal's balance was 151,133 mmbtus at 8/31/01.  Their balance is 300,521 mmbtus at 9/23/01.

We have received 33,130 mmbtus in payback from Williams through the 23rd which has decreased their balance to 242,260 mmbtus.

PG&E Topock's balance is 69,727 mmbtus due TW as of 9/23/01.


The index has decrease by about eighty cents during September which will cause a loss on volumetric oba's.

I have made the changes to the CAS Group tables in Development. Attached is a report of the Updated data. In the column headings, I have indicated where the Group names would be visible. 

I have one suggestion.

The Secondary Group Name (lack of a better name) that will be displayed on the Unsubscribed Report, should I rename those six groups to the name that is currently displayed on the report, then there would be no change to the Customers except that there are less groups. 

Let me know.

I will move forward to moving the changes into Model Office, I will inform you when this is complete. Any questions, please call me @37317.

Subject:	ST Trip Test

Late this afternoon, BVZ requested a ST Trip Test.  We were unable to do it
because of WAPA system problems related to loss of internet communications.
WAPA requested that we stay at 225 MW until further notice.

Therefore, we have scheduled to do the ST Trip at 7:01 tomorrow morning,
Sept. 19.

Possible Outcomes:
1) Go from 225 MW to 150 MW starting at 7:01 and get back up to 225 MW
during HE 10:00
2) Go from 225 MW to 150 MW starting at 7:01 then go to zero if the CTG
runs back.

DETM and WAPA have been informed of the possible outcomes.

Subject:	Smart Pigging In Sections 7 & 8

We will be running a PII Smart Pig in the mainline in section 8 and 7 during the week of September 17th.  The proposed schedule is as follows:

Monday - 9-17-01 - Safety and tailgate meeting at 1:00/PM MDT at Station 8 (Corona).  Load smart pig in station 8 mainline launcher.  Set out AGM's
Tuesday - 9-18-01 - Run smart pig from station 8 to station 7 (section 8 mainline).  Relocate AGM's as needed.  Receive pig at station 7, clean it and put it in shop.  Retrieve all AGM's
Wednesday - 9-19-01 - PII will retrieve data and prepare the pig for the next run.  Load smart pig in station 7 mainline launcher.  Set out AGM's.
Thursday - 9-20-01 - Run smart pig from station 7 to station 6 (section 7 mainline).  Relocate AGM's as needed.  Receive pig at station 6, clean it and put it in shop.  Retrieve all AGM's.
Friday - 9-21-01 - PII will retrieve data and prepare the pig for shipping.  Travel home.

Cleaning pigs have been run in both sections as gas flow allowed.  A TD Williamson representative will be on site next week to witness cleaning runs to verify the pipe is clean enough to smart pig.  TD Williamson Caliper Pigs have been run in both sections and indicate there are no restrictions in the pipe that will affect the smart pig.

Suggested lodging:
Monday the 17th - Smokey Bear Motel - 505-354-2253.  Located in downtown Capitan.  Make your reservations now or you may have no room.
Tuesday through Thursday - Best Western Oak Tree Inn - 505-861-0980.  Located on West side of I-40 at the middle exit at Belen, NM.  30 miles South of Albuquerque.

You can contact me at 505-625-8005 (work), 505-626-1530 (cell) or 800-586-5735 (pager).

Thanks,  Arnie

"TW Allocations","When doing allocation process and we allocate points or groups on the Timely, Evening, or Non-Grid. 
We allocate with the capacities that are loaded from CAS.  When allocating points or groups that have
not previously been allocated on any of the previous cycles during ID-1 or ID-2 we need to use the flow rate calculation.
.
Example :  Allocations are as follows

The only point to be exempt from this method should be Socal Needles because of their window issue
Timely:        M/L Thoreau West System                1093.000  (capacity)
                   I/B Link                                             700.000  (capacity)
                   Laplata/Ignacio                                  500.000  (capacity)
                   Socal Needles                                   775.000  (Window)
Evening:      Same sequence 
Non-Grid:     Same sequence

ID-1or ID-2:  Same sequence shows up to be allocated.  
                   Since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse 
                   click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate.  The only time we should 
                   have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously
                   allocated.                   
             
 The reason for the change is we have recieved more FERC data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes.
lets try this for a while and see how it is working.

"RE: West Texas Pool","500168 is a Bi-directional point and physically can flow both ways.  One Oak built a new delivery point with the capacity of 200,000
           and the other point that was a delivery only is still active.  The two I/C's go into different pressures into their system but physically
           located in the same yard.  TW, along with Marketing (Kevin Hyatt) asked to keep the same POI and asked to set this point
           up as a summation meter to make it easier for the customers to nom on both pipes.  Karen was involved in this point.
56943 is only a delivery only and is good for only displacement.
1635 is no longer a bi-directional point according to Will Fernandes on the Monahans team it is a delivery to NNG only.  He will
        send an e:mail.
The Burlington Jackrabbit I/C in San Juan:  That was Burlington's Plant and I/C.  They were the only shippers able to use that 
       point.  They are not using that point and they will get back with me and let us know if they want us to keep the point in active

POI 1635 is a bi-directional point but physically it only flows one way at this time.  I can change the indicator for TW in PLE, if that is what you are asking.
I'm not sure I understand what you are asking for on POI 56943.  Are you saying this point is valid for displacement and I should add it to the IT and SP displacement groups in PLE?  What does West Texas have to do with it??
POI 500168 is a delivery in PLE, not bi-directional.  If it physically does not flow both ways I can't change the indicator in PLE.  If you are scheduling due to displacement then it should be added to the displacement groups.

The decision has been made based on the latest smartpig results that the operating pressure for the pipeline section from Station 8 to Station 6 is not to exceed 939 psi until the actual status of the pipeline can be evaluated based upon the smartpig information and any necessary repairs can be made.

Additionally, a conference call for Friday (2-15) at 2:PM CST has been established to initiate discussions regarding excavations and possible repairs that may be needed.  Conference number is 877-795-3687 Code 724709.

Everyone plz try to participate in this call if at all possible.

I received a call from Sarabeth Smith stating that as of 3:00 PM today (July 31) we have a signed agreement with Citizens.  The plant is not expected to come back on line until Thursday or Friday per Darrell.  Amy is coordinating a conference call with Craig Lipke to transition the transaction management to TW.  Darrell will notify Gas Control that we are taking over the monitoring of alarms and set point (flow/pressure) control.  I will coordinate the labor distribution for both Gas Control and Customer Service. 
I want to express my thanks to Darrell, Dale, Terry, John and Amy for helping to put this deal together.  ( And of course the field personnel!)

Subject:	Alstom Motor - Gallup Station
Importance:	High

The status of the Gallup motor is as follows.  I will try to keep everyone updated as I find answers to any questions.
Please feel free to call me at 505-238-6099

The motor is in the IRS shop in Farmington NM and has had the exciter and rotor removed.  It is to the point that you can get inside and look at some of the damage but until the stator is torn down we will not be able to see anymore.  This will be a destructive move and we don't want to start this until a final decision has been made as to the process of repairing the stator.

The stator is damaged to the extent of rewinding the motor in the opinion of the Alstom rep.
The opinion of the shop foreman at IRS is that they can repair the motor but it will take 2 weeks to make the coils and 4 weeks to install them.
The other option is to see what can be done at Rugby England.
The following letter was sent to Alstom in Rugby along with some attachments of resin properties that we have on site. Paul Savory is going to contact them at 1:00am MST and discuss this with them.  I have set up a conference call on our bridge for 6:30am in hopes to get some of these questions answered.
The number is 877-795-3687  Pin  844699


The following is a copy of the letter that Paul Savory of Alstom sent his people in England.

The motor has been stripped at the IRS workshop at Farmington, New Mexico.
1 phase breaks down at around500V. The fault appears to be at the bottom of a slot, approximately 1/3 of the way down the core. Therefore it would seem that the motor needs a rewind.
Therefore there are several questions that Enron would like answers to urgently.
1 - IRS have told Enron & myself that they can manufacture new coils, strip & rewind the core & VPI the windings but this is obviously providing that we approve. attached is the spec. from the resin they use at their workshop.
2 - Would we supply a person to oversee the strip & rewind especially as Enron want to know why the motor has failed.
3 - What is the time scale for manufacture & delivery of coils from the UK.
4 - What is the time scale for a fully wound core from the UK.
5 - Is there another similar motor available that we can supply.
Please keep in mind that this motor has to meet the same criteria if it is rewound & VPI impregnated here
i.e. same rating, horsepower etc.
Please respond by E-Mail to Todd.Ingalls@enron.com
A conference call has been set up for 0630 hours USA time, Monday 27/8/01, which is 1330 hours UK time.
Please arrange for whoever is necessary to sit in.
You will have to call USA 877 795 3687. After this you will be asked to enter a pin No: - 844699. You will then be in on the conference.
Should you have any problems please call Todd Ingalls on US 505 238 6099

the above personnel.  After we have our call I would like to call Citizens and let them know if there is anything

Attached is a copy of the preliminary report that  recommends that the inlet pressure to Citizens ""Griffith Plant"" Station be  limited to 740 psig.  Note that this is only a preliminary report that  Citizens is reviewing.  Some of our ""reviewers"" are on vacation, and have  held up the process of getting this report finalized.
 
Since  I was temporarily assigned to another position during the time that gas was  introduced to this line, I have asked my employee Martin Conboy to create a log  of events on how these stations had been operated.  I will send it to you  later today.  
 
Can  you have David Roensch review to see if anything is missing.  I feel that  it is a good idea to document the different operation modes with results prior  to agreeing on any further changes.

Gentlemen, here's the first round.

I would like to set up a meeting to go over the outages on TW for 2002. The attached outage report includes the outages I have in the system data base. All the dates are up for discussion, thus the reason for this meeting. If there are any other outages the group is aware of for 2002, this would be a great time to put them on the list. That way we can work on the best plan for 2002. I would like to set up a conference call sometime next week. Maybe Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, let me know. If your plans allow you to be Houston would be even better.

Subject:	P-3 and Halley

Hey guys, 

Is there anytime today that we can meet to be sure we are all on the same page concerning P-3 and Halley issues?  My main concern is P-3, and its ability to handle the volumes we may need (pre- and post-modifications).  It seems Station 9, and the lower MAOP due to class location between P-3 & P-2, could put us at risk in various cases.

I am on vacation all next week, so if we can't do it today, Eric can set up a meeting with the rest while I'm gone.  I really don't want to let this go any longer than is necessary.

Let me know about today.

Thanks,

-Morgan

Steve here's where we are on the Gallup Compressor. Part of the stator is damaged and we're not sure if it can be repaired in place at this time. This will be decided sometime this morning and I'll let you know. If the stator cannot be repaired in place it will have to be pulled and returned to the factory. If this happens we'll be down for (I'm guessing on this) but from past experience it will be two weeks or more. I'll be at the Gallup site this morning.

Thanks

I'll try one more time for this week.  Please let me know by noon, Thursday if you can not make any of these times:

  9:00 CST, Friday, 8/31

Subject:	La Plata to Bloomfield Drag Reducing Agent Application Proposal

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Thanks for your help on this.

This is to advise that if we are now actively looking at rescheduling the smartpigging dates that was previously agreed upon at our Albuquerque mtg on April 11th, we need to know ASAP.  We do not have alot of flexibility in juggling schedules based on smartpig tool availability, but we can sure check and see what shakes out.

Plz let me know at the earliest possible date what the plans are here.

Thanks - Max

The operator for oba contract 21580(Amoco Abo) in our system is Arco Oil and Gas.  The operator for oba contract 24828(Amoco Florida) in our system is Amoco Production.  I think that the correct operator for both of these contracts should be BP Energy.  

Lorraine and Christine - Should BP Energy be listed as the operator for these contracts?  If so - Dennis, what do you need to make appropriate changes in our system?

Subject:	Request for Panhandle Pigging

Darrell,
Per our phone conversation this morning, I'm requesting gas to run pigs on the Panhandle Lateral next week.
Preferred Schedule:
  Tuesday - 8-14-01 - River to P-1
  Wednesday - 8-15-01 - P-1 to P-2
  Thursday - 8-16-01 - P-2 to P-3
I spoke with Tony Teakell and he said they can run the pig from P-2 to P-3, even with short notice.
If you and/or Gary can't get the flows at these times, contact us as soon as you know, so we can work around it.
Thanks,  Arnie

On Monday, July 9th commencing at 0700 we will be doing a hot tap on the TW 24"" panhandle lateral at the Rockwell Place meter near Canyon, Texas. This is merely a courtesy notice as the scope of work will not require any manipulation of line pressure or interruption of service.

Notes:
1) On Sunday the startup team changed their plans and did 2 ST Trip Tests
instead of tuning Duct Burners as planned.
2) Will do Duct Burner Tuning on Monday.  Expect MW swings.
3)  MW outputs are average values only in order to schedule overall gas
nomination for the 24 hour period.
4) Actual MW must be handled in real time.

Showing 150 MW on both CT's later today as a guess that some Chiller
capability will be restored.

Subject:	Devon SFS

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

Subject:	Caliper Tool Run on Section 5

Team Gallup,
We will be running the TD Williams caliper tool in section 5 (both lines) during the week of August 27th.  This run is a free run from TD Williams to try to lock down the locations of the dents in both lines near station 4 that we were unable to locate during the dig outs.  Prior to running the tools, we need to do two pig runs in each line for cleaning.  Hopefulling it can be done during the week of the 20th.
I've spoken with Gary Choquette and he requests to be informed before and after each pig run so he can check efficiencies.  
Please let me know for sure that these pigs can be run during the stated time frames, and also if you will need support help.  I think you indicated that you would need 2 people during the week of the 27th.

Darrell,
No flow restrictions will be needed for these pig runs.  The pigs, including the caliper tool can run at any speed.  We will need at lease 120mmcfd flow through station 5 to keep the pigs moving.  Do you see a problem?
Also, during the week of August 20th, we will be running the TD Williams caliper tool in the mainlines in sections 7 and 8  (station 8 all the way to station 6).  Again we will need enough flow to keep the pigs running, preferably 200mmcfd or more.  Do you see any problem?

Thanks,  Arnie

On June the 4th at 0600 El Paso Nat Gas is going to blow down a section of their pipeline that is in 
the Belen NM area. I'm sure we will be getting some calls, so we thought we would let you know.
If you could also forward this to gas control  it would sure help. Thanks, Mountainair team.

Subject:	RE: TW Lines

Now that we have all the parties involved, here is what we need. A pig needs to be ran from the Canadian River Station to P-3 on the TW 24"" Panhandle Lateral. In order to be able to do this, we will need to receive gas at Canadian River Station preferably by Williams. I understand that we only have gas flow going from P-3 to Canandian, but in order for us to maintain pipeline integrity, we need to work together to make this happen twice a year. We work with Williams to enable them to run a pig, so I'm sure they would be willing to work with us. Currently this is our only alternative since we are unable to pig from P-3 to Canadian. It has been several years since this pig has been ran and the last time P-3 was flooded with fluid. 

As far as the Leedey Lateral goes, we need to pig, but economics will be hard. We will do some more leg work on this.

Subject:	RE: TW Lines

Someone needs to call Jerry Graves or myself to schedule a pig run.  We will need to have some coordination to flow gas from the P-3 side
of the Canadian station to ensure you enough gas to run the pig to feldman. 
With max flows from the P-2 area they can run a pig from P-2 to P-3 anytime.  It just needs to be coordinated with the teams and gas
control.
Mickey, hope this answers you questions.  If not call me.  

Let us know.

The problem is we haven't ran a pig on these lines in years. In order to insure our pipeline integrity, we need to work through these obstacles and get something resolved. We know we have lots of liquid in these lines and need to proceed with pigging.

Please let me know what we need to do to get this accomplished.

 Dear (INSERT NAME HERE)
I have a small favor to ask. I have friends who are camping their way
around the States and Canada. They have asked me if I know where they
might be able to go without spending large amounts of money. I said I
would
try my friends and family for accommodations.  They travel light and
bring all
their own camping gear, and only require a small place to set up. I have
already given them your name and address anyway in anticipation that you
won't mind. I have enclosed a picture to help identify them if they turn
up. They may bring the green Mercedes or the white one - sometimes they use
both.
Thanks in advance.

Subject:	Bisti Motor Update

The Bisti Motor failed Thursday evening and resulted in a station ESD.  Initially, it was thought that the ESD was the result of a faulure in one of the fire detectors.  Once the alarms were cleared by the Operators and the station was totally reset, an attempt at a restart was made.  A variety of alarms (primarily related to the Motor RTD's) started flagging.  The Operators continued through a trouble shooting process that lasted until late this afternoon at which point it was determined that the motor had failed.  

Industrial Repair Service (IRS) out of Farmington Nm. was contacted and a rep. (Doug Harrison shop foreman) is due on site this evening (Friday) to further evaluate and provide timelines/schedules for removal.  Todd Ingalls has been in discussions with IRS's Paul Heikkinen (505-860-2398) in an effort to coordinate this removal process.   At this point, Operations is proceeding with a turnkey scope of work request from IRS for removal, repair and re-installation.  Moving as quickly as possible to turnaround this motor, field estimates tonight are in the range of 4 to 6 weeks.  We are looking at a ""stator"" failure this time versus the historic ""rotor"" failures that have occured at this facility.  

A couple of issues need to be discussed so I have set up a conf. call for 1:00 pm CST Monday.  (877-795-3687  pin 151120)  Updates should be available by this time.  (In the mean while, we are moving forward, pending IRS's availability, with the removal of the equipment)

Subject:	TW Allocations

When doing allocation process and we allocate points or groups on the Timely, Evening, or Non-Grid. 
We allocate with the capacities that are loaded from CAS.  When allocating points or groups that have
not previously been allocated on any of the previous cycles during ID-1 or ID-2 we need to use the flow rate calculation.
.
Example :  Allocations are as follows

The only point to be exempt from this method should be Socal Needles because of their window issue
Timely:        M/L Thoreau West System                1093.000  (capacity)
                   I/B Link                                             700.000  (capacity)
                   Laplata/Ignacio                                  500.000  (capacity)
                   Socal Needles                                   775.000  (Window)
Evening:      Same sequence 
Non-Grid:     Same sequence

ID-1or ID-2:  Same sequence shows up to be allocated.  
                   Since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse 
                   click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate.  The only time we should 
                   have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously
                   allocated.                   
             
 The reason for the change is we have recieved more FERC data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes.
lets try this for a while and see how it is working.

No matter how hard I try to get BVZ to include float in the schedule, to
allow for the ""unknown things"" which are bound to occur, they insist on the
most optimistic outcome and it never happens.

On Friday we will do the tests as detailed below.  After that there are
other tests which will take place before the plant goes commercial.

   This schedule is for performance testing as follows:

   1) Cold Start Test
        Must bring the plant up to Base Load in less than 8 hours.
        Scheduled to start both CT's during HE 8:00

   2) Steam Turbine Trip Test:
        Scheduled to occur in HE 17:00 then bring CT back up to base.

   3) Operation at Minimum Load:
        Scheduled to occur  HE 21:00 to HE 22:00

   Special Request to DETM and WAPA for today to permit Griffith to change
   plant output without constraint as long as we strive to make the average
   MW
   shown on this schedule for each hour.  (This has been approved by Cal
   Ingram of WAPA)

   Note: If something happens and BVZ cannot stay on this schedule, then
   DETM
   can again call for limits on the timing of ramp up or down as required.

I added a tab ""monthly"" which accumlates the monthly imbalances per operator.  The accumulated monthly total balance would be the monthly oba imbalance net.

Would this be useful information until we develop the automated version.

Subject:	FW: SoCal - November 1 Changes

            We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they
	     only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can 
	     call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and 
	     Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact
	     to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	Griffith Gas & Electric Estimate - Friday Sept. 14, HE 8:00 to Saturday Sept 15, HE 7:00

This schedule is for performance testing as follows:

1) Cold Start Test
     Must bring the plant up to Base Load in less than 8 hours.
     Scheduled to start both CT's during HE 8:00

2) Steam Turbine Trip Test:
     Scheduled to occur in HE 17:00 then bring CT back up to base.

3) Operation at Minimum Load:
     Scheduled to occur  HE 21:00 to HE 22:00

Special Request to DETM and WAPA for today to permit Griffith to change
plant output without constraint as long as we strive to make the average MW
shown on this schedule for each hour.  (This has been approved by Cal
Ingram of WAPA)

Note: If something happens and BVZ cannot stay on this schedule, then DETM
can again call for limits on the timing of ramp up or down as required.

Dale,

I do not have the list of ""softpoints"" with me that are available to Gas Control from the Citizen's Fisher ROC, but generally remember it as follows:  (we can go over it point by point Friday when I return to Roswell if you would like)

TW & ElPaso's rotary meters: flow rate, current accum, prev accum, press and temp.
TW & ElPaso's turbine meters: no data
TW & ElPaso's ultrasonic meters: no data

TW & ElPaso's station results: totalized flow rate (it would be nice to have volume and energy accums)

All the station control registers look to be adequate.  All of the two state points that we normally would treat as Digital Inputs  are treated as Analog Input variables.

If these points are sufficient, it will be straight forward to map these to modbus registers.  If more points are required, we will need permission from Citizens to modify their FSTs.  As I stated on the conference call, this work is not difficult, but may be considered to be intrusive were we will be programming lines of code in the same area that their complex station control code resides.

Per Darrell and Jerry's comments below, we can proceed with the unloader installation at any time. I talked to Ed and had a message from Jon. Jon is tied up in Florida through the 22nd, probably. He can be at Station 8 the week of the 25th. He'll check and confirm that.

Gene and I talked and we'll plan on doing the install on both units (one at a time) the week of the 25th.

Darrell / Jerry
We are about ready to install the unloader system at Station 8 to wrap up the automation project. We've been working on installing electrical and mechanical equipment without disabling the units. The valve people estimate 2 days per unit to install the valve actuators / unloaders and do some commissioning work. We just need one unit at a time.

Do we need to wait until the tarriff months are over? Jerry can you send me an outage request form?

Subject:	Westar Ward outage

Per our discussion concerning the needed outage at Westar Ward for aprox. 3 hours to dig up an underground check valve. We have scheduled to do this Thursday, Aug. 30th, at 08:00hrs. We do not know what kind of check valve is there, so the plan is to shut down the station, dig out the check valve, determine what type of check, and then put the station back in service until we can get the needed parts such as o-ring or top gasket for that type of check. The best case senario is that the check will be of the type that we can just pull the top, remove the clapper, replace top gasket and top, and put back in service. This will require another short outage as we can not have the parts on hand until we determine the type of check valve. Worst case senario is that the check type is not one that we can remove the clapper which will require us to obtain another type of check valve and replace the hole check which would again require another short outage. I will get back to you on scheduling the second outage as soon as possible. If you have any questions, give me a call.

Thanks,
Baker

"Citizens contract for Griffith operation","Citizens is going to sign the agency and operating agreement today.  TW will be taking over the operations
and monitoring the Griffith plant on Citizens behalf.  We will be monitoring the alarms at the plant and you have
a call out sheet for Citizens personnel.  We also will be responsible for the operations at the plant.  Currently
in Scada we have Griffith Power Plant El Paso and Griffith Power Plant TW.  Please get familiar with the points
and how set points will need to be sent.  To change El Paso, the set point will be at 1.  TW will be at 2.
When you send flow set points of 140,000 that will automatically convert to pressure control.  Set points less than
140,000 will stay on flow control.  We will have to experiment with set points when we have orders on TW and 
El Paso.  Currently we have orders just off of TW.

1.  Currently El Paso is set on 140,000 flow which will control on pressure and TW flow set point is at 120,000.
     this is on flow control.  
2.  When we have a flow order from El Paso we may want to set them on flow control and TW on pressure.   We
     will just have to experiment with the best operation. 
3.  Remember the above mentioned is at the plant and not at the TW Mainline I/C.  We are working with Citizens 
     to be able to see El Paso Mainline I/C.(El Paso will be responsible for the Mainline I/C and setpoints.) 

I put a copy of the agreement in everyone's inbox for your review.  
If you have questions we can get with Craig Lipke with Citizens and ask for their help.  Last conversation with him
was we would just have to operate and see which scenario best fits the situation.  In other words they really don't
know which is the best way to operate.

  Yes Ronnie, I would still like to do that for 2 reasons.

1.	It moves the overhaul on unit 401 into March, which is the same month we are doing the tie-ins at Station 1 and 3. And since there will be a flow restriction from those tie-ins we can coordinate the two outages together and save a little of the flow loss.
2.	Starting and finishing the overhauls earlier will keep us away from our summer comments, if there are problems or delays.    

       If  there are no objections, I will change the dates to the new schedule listed below.

March 1st, 2002. If its still works for you lets give it a try. The only
concerns at this time may be parts delivery time, but I think we will be
ok. The recommended outage dates are listed below. Let me know if this will
work for you. Thanks!

Ronnie........

401 start date 3-1-2002, Completion date 4-9-2001
402 start date 4-11-2002, Completion date 4-21-2001
403 start date 4-23-2001, Completion date 5-3-2001

BP-Amoco has requested a meeting take place in our offices on the afternoon of September 11th, or anytime September 12th or 13th.

Please check you calendars and let me know when you would be available. They are interested in discussing the outage and the resulting delays in re-establishing service.  Also, they are wish to  understanding the nature of the delays, the likelihood they may be repeated in the future, how communications between our companies can be improved, and how to promote a better relationship at the operations level between our two companies.

They mentioned that they have suffered economically, and may seek some form of restitution.

Thanks for your help,

Subject:	TW Allocations

When doing allocation process and we allocate points or groups on the Timely, Evening, or Non-Grid. 
We allocate with the capacities that are loaded from CAS.  When allocating points or groups that have
not previously been allocated on any of the previous cycles during ID-1 or ID-2 we need to use the flow rate calculation.
.
Example :  Allocations are as follows

The only point to be exempt from this method should be Socal Needles because of their window issue
Timely:        M/L Thoreau West System                1093.000  (capacity)
                   I/B Link                                             700.000  (capacity)
                   Laplata/Ignacio                                  500.000  (capacity)
                   Socal Needles                                   775.000  (Window)
Evening:      Same sequence 
Non-Grid:     Same sequence

ID-1or ID-2:  Same sequence shows up to be allocated.  
                   Since they were previously allocated on the earlier cycles we do not need to right mouse 
                   click and calculate flow and update capacity based on flow rate.  The only time we should 
                   have to calculate flow rate is when there is a new point or group shows up that has not been previously
                   allocated.                   
             
 The reason for the change is we have recieved more FERC data requests on capacities and scheduled volumes.
lets try this for a while and see how it is working.

I think TW should exclude non-physical points.  This seems to be addressed in ""What needs to be added"" where it says ""Listing all physical points valid for transport"", but I'm sure it would clarify things to have that non-physical points should be excluded in the ""What points to include"" category.

Subject:	RE: Draft - SoCal/Topock Announcement

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

I'm asking Ramona a question - it would probably be good if I had her on the address list =)

Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Subject:	Draft - SoCal/Topock Announcement

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

Thanks!

Subject:	Outage update

Station 1:
Unit 101 was completed on the 24th. 
Unit 103 had one bearing that was running a higher then normal temp. We decide to utilize the contractor to change the bearing. The bearing was removed Thursday evening. Due to the amount of aluminum in the bearing saddle the cleanup is taking longer than we had hoped for. I just talked with station 1, and they are in the process of installing the bearing now. If all goes well, the unit should be running in a couple of hours. 

  This should complete all the scheduled overhaul work that was planed for stations 1-4.

The plan for the weekend is to cut the volume flowing down the A-line to around 30mmcf/day this should reduce the moisture at Bushton significantly.  We plan to resume the sweep after the holiday and hope to have it completed in a timely manner.  If their are any questions or comments please let us know. Personnel can be reached at either number through the weekend.

Jeanne,
In talking with Mark McConnell, Jerry Graves and Darrell Schoolcraft we think that if you can have David Duff pull the following point operational capacity out of TCI we can determine what Mark needs.  Please go back as far as you can in the database.  Some points may not exist because they were not in place back in 93 or 94, but pull as much history as you can. 
	Name			POI           
	SoCal - Topock		0056697
	SoCal - Needles		0010487
	PG&E - Topock		0056698
	S.W. Willow Valley	0013198
	N. Starsteel		0500383
	Mojave - Topock		0056696
	Citizen - Kingman	0056659
	Citizen - 89 North	0500046
	Citizen - Forest Branch	0500619
	Citizens - Flagstaff	0500134


Darrell, Jerry and I would like to validate the information prior to forwarding to Mark, so please send me the file and I will coordinate the review.  It might be helpful to know the field names in TCI if you can't find operational capacity.  We probably called it something different back then.

Thank you for your help.

CITZ.1001	General Alarm 2"" Rotary Meters
CITZ.1002	General Station Alarm

They are working to see what is going on and will let us know when they are working.

Also, George Marshall found out that the Accums for the 2"" runs on both the TW and El Paso side do not appear to be resetting at gas day.  Calls have been place to Citizens to follow up on this.

This was originally an Enron operated facility prior to selling of the gathering assets, which then became a Duke operated  facility. This point was re-activated in December,2000, without Measurement's knowledge, and apparently Market Services and others until April 2001. Had this been a new point, the current procedures for assigning station number, POI numbers, etc. would have probably prevented an incident such as this from occurring. Bottom line, in addition to generating PPAs and  distortion of the pipeline balance report by improper accounting of all receipts and deliveries, this has raised several areas of concern such as safety, transportation of unscheduled volumes, and others. We would like to schedule a meeting sometime in June (time and place to be announced),  to address procedurally, what all departmental requirements are for volumes to enter and exit our pipeline facilities. Please forward to contacts within you various organizations that you feel are necessary and critical to examination of current procedures, and possibly adoption of new ones, and let me know and I will add them to the distribution.
Thanks-
Gary

I called Ronnie and he said he remembers it but we had to assign a new number.  He didn't know what it is seeing as he's here in Houston.  I tried calling Sammy Williams, he too is in Houston.  I talked to Danny Garvin he only knew of one Duke connect and the name did not match up.  I also paged Randy Fitzgerald, he has not returned my call.  Karen is having the same problem getting hold of anyone.  I didn't see it on your first and finals either.  Anyway, if you know anything about this call Karen in the AM and let her know.

Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady.

		Ron M.		118587

I checked on flights and the best bet is a 2:30 pm flight arriving Albuquerque at 3:36 pm (next one wouldn't get in until 7:37 pm).  Flights back to Houston are 2:40 pm and 4:30 pm arriving at 5:37 & 7:37 pm respectively.  I vote for the 4:30 pm flight to make sure we don't run short on time.  

LET ME KNOW ASAP MONDAY TO BOOK.  Right now the fare is  $156.25 & non-refundable.  Not sure what it will be Monday.

Kim,

I don't know your plans in and out of Albuquerque so I didn't book a room for you.  I thought you were headed elsewhere from Albuqueruque.  Let me know if you want me to do something on arrangements.

Subject:	Re: Concern - Possible Change In Smartpigging Dates   

Is there a reason we think we will need to run station 8.  I think with the volumes we will have to move to insure 6 miles and hour for the smart pig
will be approx. 100 to 200 m2.  If my thinking is wrong please let me know.

Subject:	Concern - Possible Change In Smartpigging Dates

This is to advise that if we are now actively looking at rescheduling the smartpigging dates that was previously agreed upon at our Albuquerque mtg on April 11th, we need to know ASAP.  We do not have alot of flexibility in juggling schedules based on smartpig tool availability, but we can sure check and see what shakes out.

Plz let me know at the earliest possible date what the plans are here.

Thanks - Max

TW - Station 6-7 & Station 7-8 Smart Pigging - C.014524/C.014527
Project will conflict with Station 8 Automation Project if conducted in September or later.  Actively chasing TD Williams and PII for their cost estimates.  Must review costs to determine if dollars are sufficient.  Project should try to be a done in August or sooner if at all possible.

Subject:	Re: Questar IC

Earl, we noted in a weekly report that this IC was approved for construction with a May 1st startup date.  [Chanley, Earl]  David, the IC has not been approved to date, a PA has been submitted and is being routed for approvals.   We gave a heads up to Jerry and Darryl that a potential interruption to flow could occur in the near future as a result of tie-ins for this IC.  Jerry and Darryl then requested that the tie-ins be made during our LaPlata outage which is a three day outage during April 2nd, 3rd, & 4th.   [Chanley, Earl]   Talked with Darrel and the Hot tap date will coordinate with other outage of April 2, 2002. Line pressure has to be lowered to 702# for welding.  I asked that Jerry and Darryl discuss the time frame of tie-ins for Questar with you, as I could not say one way or the other if you could mobilize by then.  [Chanley, Earl]   trying to get material ASAP for tap. Working on details of who buys material for the IC. Will know more next week.  

Jerry/Darryl, I did however, discuss with the Team to determine if the tie-ins occured during the same time frame as the La Plata outage, what would be the impact to manpower and scheduling of tasks at La Plata.  The Team committed to the tie-ins during the same time frame but will be asking for 4 days of down time at La Plata now versus the 3 days origianlly requested.  They will look at options such as contract labor, support team, etc... to see if they can squeeze this back to three days, but it will be a few weeks before that information is communicated.   [Chanley, Earl]  David, E&C will have the contract crews, Inspector and others in place to lessen the impact to their schedule.   [Chanley, Earl]  The team choice to extend the outage should not be based on the tap as E&C will supply any support needed, if the team has concerns, contact me and we will work them out.  

Chris Gaston will be the team point of contact for the Questar tie-ins...  Blackie Foutz will be the Team point person for measurment related issues related to design/installation.

Earl, can you provide the team with the work order number so that payroll can be charged as they become involved?   [Chanley, Earl]  As soon as it is approved and funded.  Also, can you provide the tentative date of commissioning the interconnect so that we can insure George Kniesley is available to participate along with the team.   [Chanley, Earl]  IN service is requested for May 1, 02, but will know more after meeting with Questar on who will purchase material and build.  
 
Team, charge time to the work order only as support is requested from E&C and/or is necessary as part of start up and commissioning.  

If I can do anything to help, please give me a call...

Jack Ohearn with Questar and Roswell E&C will meet at the Bloomfield station on 2-20-02 @ 8:00 am to determine where the interconnect will be located, TW or Questar right of way. All of the details of the IC are being worked out and TW is to own and operate at this time. Locations, design, who is to construct and equipment are issues being resolved at this time. 
If you have any questions, please let me know next week. 
I'm not sure of who the team contact will be on this project, but if the team or contact has other commitments, this meeting is to resolve the location and the team's impute is welcome.

Subject:	Gallup Compressor

As you know the Gallup motor is being repaired by Industrial Repair Service in Farmington, NM. After a lot of discussion with Alstrom in the States and England they allowed us to have the motor repaired here instead of shipping back to England. This will save us approximately five weeks since it can be repaired in three weeks here versus seven to eight weeks in England. It will be out of the shop in Farmington on the 20th of September  and we'll be ready to install immediately. 

The repair costs will be $150,000 and we ETS will be obligated to pay the difference in what Alstrom could have did it for. We'll also ask for whatever dollars it would have cost to send it to England and back.  Industrial Repair Service is doing the job for ETS so this means we will be held responsible for the repair cost and will have to recover our dollars from Alstrom. Arnold will work with Alstom on this after the unit is repaired. I'll assist in any way I can.

We'll still have two years warranty on the motor and Alstom will be responsible to ETS for this. 

Thanks for everyone's help on this and we'll continue to have conference calls until we have the unit in service. In case you would like to join the call the next one will be October 4th at 07:30 MST. Call in number 1-877-795-3687   code 844699. 

Below are pictures showing the damage. If I have missed anyone please pass the information on.

Phil I just got off the phone with Arnold and we have been advised that in the morning around 5 o'clock eastern time is the earliest that Alstrom will have information for us. From talking with Arnold, Alstrom has to get permission from England before they can give us approval to pull the unit. Since the unit is still under warranty we'll need to wait on directions from Alstrom. The team is doing more testing with Alstrom during this time to try and figure out how much damage the unit has.

We do have Norm Spalding's group lining up a contractor to assist in pulling the unit and transporting it for us. I'll keep everyone undated as soon as we get more information.

Thanks

Steve here's where we are on the Gallup Compressor. Part of the stator is damaged and we're not sure if it can be repaired in place at this time. This will be decided sometime this morning and I'll let you know. If the stator cannot be repaired in place it will have to be pulled and returned to the factory. If this happens we'll be down for (I'm guessing on this) but from past experience it will be two weeks or more. I'll be at the Gallup site this morning.

I would appreciate discussing any issues or concerns you might have with regards to Griffith.  I think I will be able to save you some time and effort here.   Please contact me on my cell phone for the remainder of this week (520-853-3253).

Subject:	TW 1090 Update

An update on TW mainline capacity west of station 4 after last weekend's efforts.  Using my tuned hydraulic model (with updated friction factors using current SCADA) and the current efficiencies and available power, and adjusting ground temperature to August conditions, I project we can transport a net of 1082 MMSCFD.  At 1010 BTU, this is an equivalent of 1093 MM/D.

Note that the overall unit efficiencies and pipeline roughness did not change significantly from previous models.  What did change is the net available power (as generated by Jon's speed uprate algorithm).  The net result is a net increase in gas horsepower at Stations 1 & 2 by ~4%.

Note that the margin is very close to the 1090 firm volumes.  We will want to monitor operations closely to ensure we maintain unit efficiencies/power output.  We may have to do some unit repairs during tariff months as nominations allow.  This may entail repairs on the weekends.

I also note (as Mr. Schoolcraft pointed out to me) that we are seeing a large fluctuation in the flows at Griffith  (110 MM/d for 30 minutes, off for an hour, cyclical).  From what Darrell has told me, this is due to the way Griffith's flow/pressure control is configured with their dual feed interconnect.  Modifications to the interconnect controls that would smooth these flows would enhance deliverability.  Ideas anyone?  Earl, do you have pipeline/interconnect drawings & EFM/control information on this station for my review?

As part of the control modifications at stations 1 & 2, the remote speed setpoint (from Houston Gas Control) has been deactivated.  Currently Station 2 is being limited by differential pressure control at 175#.  I recommend setting the differential setpoints out of range (200#) and dispatching only on discharge pressure control.  This will ensure we are not limiting power output due to differential pressures.

Subject:	LATE NIGHT NOTES

ID2:		The streak of non-variances ended tonight.  One variance was intentional, but the other was not.  In any case I had to
		manually schedule volumes at Transcolorado and Northwest for Sempra's CR 27848 and 27342, respectively due to 
		downstream confirmation cuts.
	
EVE:		All the points looked okay with the minor exception of Transcolorado.

OTHER:	The Force Majeure at Bisti looks like it will continue for 5 to 6 weeks.  Since San Juan will likely be cut every cycle,
		we need to allocate the NGPL points, Gray, Eddy, and Winkler even if San Juan does not appear on the original 			allocation list.  By allocating these points, the bogus volume at Northwest delivery will disappear, and then San Juan 		should come up for allocation.  I learned this the hard way by ignoring those points on the ID2 cycle for 3/15.  I knew 		the Enserco volumes were not going to be confirmed, but the delivery at Northwest over-inflated the deliveries at San 			Juan and should have been allocated.  The net effect was San Juan scheduled over 842,000 even though Darrell had 			the capacity at 800,000.

		For the good news, Joe Hoang recached our batch printer options so now the ""J"" printer at 3920 is usable.


See you later,  Bert

Subject:	Griffith Testing Prior to Plant Outage

We are now in the process of planning a total Griffith Plant Outage to fix
equipment deficiencies.
Most likely start of Outage is on Sunday Aug. 12.  (earliest Saturday)
Duration of Plant Outage is approximately 6 days.

We have been running very steady for the last couple of days.  However,
please be advised that prior to the outage, various operational tests are
being planned.  During this time, MW output will be variable and difficult
to schedule. May I request your indulgence as we work through this phase.

Tomorrow morning, the Startup Manager will produce a list of tests to be
run prior to the outage.
As the Test Plan is developed, I will keep everyone informed as much as
possible.

Subject:	LATE NIGHT NOTES

ID2:		Had to manually schedule Northwest CR 20786/24954, PNM CR 20785/25397, and TW CR 22948 because the receipt 		points were considered invalid.  The system EPSQ'd all the volumes down to 50%.  I didn't have any problems with the 		Northwest or PNM contracts, but I had to trace the TW admin contract all the way down the West Texas and Central 		pools.  I was able to reinstate a lot of the gas, but Astra's ended up at Socal and part of Richardson's gas ended up at 		Socal and PG&E.  Sempra's went to Calpine, Reliant went to Southwest Gas Mojave, and USGT's went to both Rio 			Puerco 	and Westar Ward so I fixed their volumes.

		I had to manually fix Williams' CR 24925 and Texaco's CR 25923/25924 due to variances at El Paso Blanco and 			Mojave, respectively.  Williams was off by 1 MMBtu while Texaco netted to zero.  West of Thoreau scheduled to 			938,382 and San Juan at 772,209.  I confirmed the scheduled volumes with Gas Control for all the points involved.

EVE:		Had to manually schedule the Northwest and PNM Hub contracts again.  I did not touch the gas sales on the admin 			contract.  Hopefully it will schedule in the Non-Grid.  ANR is slightly off, and one Northwest Receipt changed by 1 on 		cycle 3.  The Northwest delivery from Milagro should schedule on the Non-Grid.  I submitted the volumes to WFS as if 		they did schedule on the Evening.

NON-GRID:	Confirmed down USGT's 27161 at Halley since NNG did not have a nomination in their system.  I got caught up trying 		to fix the Hub contracts that I did not notice the problem on the Evening cycle especially since Debra is working for 			the South end.  I nominated the payback volume on ANR's OBA for 15,000 on the 19th as well as the 20th through 			22nd.  I also confirmed the volumes for each day.  Check to make sure I am going in the right direction.  At least the 		system didn't get hung up during the confirmations like they did over the weekend.

If you need me on Tuesday, call me at home or page me.  I plan to work Wednesday night unless someone tells me otherwise.

We are flying on one wing today.  CT #2 is not in service because of a
failure on a valve operator motor.

Testing will continue at reduced Plant output.  Expect load swings which
must be scheduled in real time.
An ST Trip Test is planned again for today, as well as some Duct Burner
tuning.

Subject:	Caliper Tool & Smart Pig Runs

In preparation for smart pigging the mainline in sections 7 & 8 in September, TDW caliper tool runs were performed last week.  We also ran the caliper tools in both lines of section 5 this week to pinpoint dents indicated last year by TDW.  They were unable to get valid data from their equipment last year and performed this weeks run at no cost.

The caliper runs were successful and the following is preliminary data:

August 21st
Caliper run on Mainline from Sta. 7 to Sta. 6 - No indications of dents or ovalities greater than 1.5"" (5% of pipe diameter). 

August 22nd
Caliper run on Mainline from Sta. 8 to Sta. 7 - Three indications of dents above 1.5"" - 1.71"", 1.75"" & 2.45"".   According to PII the 2.45"" dent should still leave approximately .5"" clearance for the smart tool to pass.  All indications above 1.5"" will need to be repaired per our procedures.  This will probably be done when making repairs resulting form the smart pig run.  This is preliminary field data and could change with further evaluation by TDW.  The full report will be complete in two to four weeks.  The TDW representative did say that any changes would be to a smaller number.

August 28th
Caliper run on Loopline from Sta. 5 to Sta. 4 - Three indications of dents above 1.5"" - 1.89"", 2.05"" & 2.59"".  These numbers should be reduced somewhat after further evaluation, taking the pig speed into consideration.

August 29th
Caliper run on Mainline from Sta. 5 to Sta. 4 - Four indications of dents above 1.5"" - 1.61"", 1.86"", 2.09"" & 2.09"".  Again, these numbers will probably be reduced with further evaluation.

We will need to schedule repairs for any dents 1.5"" or greater.  To be able to make the repairs we may have to reduce pressures to 60% MAOP.  During tie-ins on the Red Rock project might be a good time.

The smart pig runs in section 7 & 8 are on schedule and will be performed the week of September 17th.  The Sta. 8 to Sta. 7 smart pig will be run on Tuesday and the Sta. 7 to Sta. 6 smart pig will be run on Thursday.

TDW cleaning pigs will be run in both sections the prior week (September 10th).  There will be a TDW representative on site to verify the line is clean enough to smart pig.  John Gormley will coordinate the cleaning pig runs.

Great appreciation to Teams Roswell, Gallup, Laguna, Mountainair, John Gormley, Steve Tarter & TW Gas Control for the good and safe work performed.  The project went smooth.

Subject:	Bisti Motor Update

The Bisti Motor failed Thursday evening and resulted in a station ESD.  Initially, it was thought that the ESD was the result of a faulure in one of the fire detectors.  Once the alarms were cleared by the Operators and the station was totally reset, an attempt at a restart was made.  A variety of alarms (primarily related to the Motor RTD's) started flagging.  The Operators continued through a trouble shooting process that lasted until late this afternoon at which point it was determined that the motor had failed.  

Industrial Repair Service (IRS) out of Farmington Nm. was contacted and a rep. (Doug Harrison shop foreman) is due on site this evening (Friday) to further evaluate and provide timelines/schedules for removal.  Todd Ingalls has been in discussions with IRS's Paul Heikkinen (505-860-2398) in an effort to coordinate this removal process.   At this point, Operations is proceeding with a turnkey scope of work request from IRS for removal, repair and re-installation.  Moving as quickly as possible to turnaround this motor, field estimates tonight are in the range of 4 to 6 weeks.  We are looking at a ""stator"" failure this time versus the historic ""rotor"" failures that have occured at this facility.  

A couple of issues need to be discussed so I have set up a conf. call for 1:00 pm CST Monday.  (877-795-3687  pin 151120)  Updates should be available by this time.  (In the mean while, we are moving forward, pending IRS's availability, with the removal of the equipment)

Subject:	Dig locations - integrity work

Per our discussion on Friday, attached are the spreadsheets that show the
dig locations for the integrity work. Please look at the column that shows
Mile Post since there is a lot of other information on the spreadsheet that
you do not need.  We will need to have the pipeline pressure less than 655
when we excavate these locations.  We need to discuss outage dates after you
have a chance to look at the locations and do some modeling.

 One spreadsheet shows only the dents from 8-7 and 5-4 mainline and 5-4
loopline.  All of these need to be excavated. A second spreadsheet shows the
pits from 7-6.  These all need to be excavated since they did not meet the
LAPA calculation criteria.  Then, a third spreadsheet shows the pits from
8-7 and we are planning to only excavate a couple in order to verify the
LAPA calculations with R-String calculations.  There are no dents from 7-6
which need to be looked at.

8-7
From 8-7 there are 3 dents on the mainline and they are all in an area where
the pipeline is not looped. These will all be excavated and a sleeve or
clock spring will be installed.  There are a couple of pits on the line that
will be excavated.  We will start with the pits at mile post 28.567 and
28.570.  These are in the segment of line that is looped.  If the R-String
calculations on the pits agree with the LAPA calculations, we will recoat
the line and stop with those two.  If they do not meet the LAPA
calculations, we will continue with the next closest one and continue on
until we get some agreement.  We can do the two that are not in the looped
segment last, if we have to, but we do not expect to have to excavate more
than the two.

7-6
The spreadsheet shows 19 pits that need to be checked.  However, 3 of them
have already been replaced in the Becker Flats work order, which leaves 16
pits.  Of the 16, only one is in the area that is looped.  (Murphy's law at
work here.)  All 16 pits need to be  checked and repaired with either a
sleeve or a clock spring.  However, there are really only 8 sites since some
are very close together.

5-4 Mainline
All five dents need to be excavated and sleeved or a clock spring installed.
All are in the area that is looped.

5-4 Loopline
All eight dents need to be excavated and sleeved or a clock spring
installed.  All are in the area that is looped.

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Thanks for your help on this.

Like we talked about yesterday, Tri-States has decided to do some switching around on their equipment and in our sub-station. They still plan to change their insulators on July 12th but it should not effect operations at Gallup. Sorry for the false alarm.

Until a decision is made or direction is provided for this warranty unit, we are standing by......

Steve here's where we are on the Gallup Compressor. Part of the stator is damaged and we're not sure if it can be repaired in place at this time. This will be decided sometime this morning and I'll let you know. If the stator cannot be repaired in place it will have to be pulled and returned to the factory. If this happens we'll be down for (I'm guessing on this) but from past experience it will be two weeks or more. I'll be at the Gallup site this morning.

Thanks

As you know the Gallup motor is being repaired by Industrial Repair Service in Farmington, NM. After a lot of discussion with Alstrom in the States and England they allowed us to have the motor repaired here instead of shipping back to England. This will save us approximately five weeks since it can be repaired in three weeks here versus seven to eight weeks in England. It will be out of the shop in Farmington on the 20th of September  and we'll be ready to install immediately. 

The repair costs will be $150,000 and we ETS will be obligated to pay the difference in what Alstrom could have did it for. We'll also ask for whatever dollars it would have cost to send it to England and back.  Industrial Repair Service is doing the job for ETS so this means we will be held responsible for the repair cost and will have to recover our dollars from Alstrom. Arnold will work with Alstom on this after the unit is repaired. I'll assist in any way I can.

We'll still have two years warranty on the motor and Alstom will be responsible to ETS for this. 

Thanks for everyone's help on this and we'll continue to have conference calls until we have the unit in service. In case you would like to join the call the next one will be October 4th at 07:30 MST. Call in number 1-877-795-3687   code 844699. 

Below are pictures showing the damage. If I have missed anyone please pass the information on.

Subject:	TW Station 1 Heat Recovery

Daryl,  I thought it may be more efficient to compose my question in an e-mail.

I am developing a project at this station in which the exhaust from the new LM 2500 gas turbine could be used to generate up to 15 megawatts of electricity.  After several weeks of engineering and financial analysis, I am now beginning to market the project to prospective counter-parties including local utilities and cooperatives. 

One issue that will certainly be discussed is the risk of the LM 2500 not producing enough exhaust to generate the contracted amounts of electricity.  This could occur because of either mechanical failure or loss of throughput in Transwestern's pipeline.  In the latter case, Transwestern could choose several alternatives to transport reduced volumes of gas to the CA border including reducing the horsepower in some or all stations uniformly or shutting down and bypassing some stations while others run at normal speed.  If I did this deal, naturally, I would want Station 1 to run as much as possible so I would have the exhaust needed to generate the electricity I've sold.  Otherwise I pay penalties.

My question to you is...  if volumes through TW were to decline, say 25% or so below design rate, would it be possible to keep Station 1 going at 100% and cut other stations back or does that just not make any sense?

Come by when you're ready and we'll discuss.

Thanks,

John

Darrell,

POI 56943 has never been bi-directional in the system?  It has always been an out.  Is there another point number that was used as the receipt?
As far as Jackrabbit the field needs to call in that the point is inactive and should be abandoned.  We can inactivate the point to keep people from noming if you want to do that.

                                   are still one 8"" orfice run dedicated to flow gas back to TW.  They apologize for the confussion.
Burlington Jackrabbit-- Olivia with Burlington called and the point does no longer exist on their side and will not ever be using it.
                                  Does this mean we can inactivate it on TW?

500168 is a Bi-directional point and physically can flow both ways.  One Oak built a new delivery point with the capacity of 200,000
           and the other point that was a delivery only is still active.  The two I/C's go into different pressures into their system but physically
           located in the same yard.  TW, along with Marketing (Kevin Hyatt) asked to keep the same POI and asked to set this point
           up as a summation meter to make it easier for the customers to nom on both pipes.  Karen was involved in this point.
56943 is only a delivery only and is good for only displacement.
1635 is no longer a bi-directional point according to Will Fernandes on the Monahans team it is a delivery to NNG only.  He will
        send an e:mail.
The Burlington Jackrabbit I/C in San Juan:  That was Burlington's Plant and I/C.  They were the only shippers able to use that 
       point.  They are not using that point and they will get back with me and let us know if they want us to keep the point in active
       status.
If any other questions please call

POI 1635 is a bi-directional point but physically it only flows one way at this time.  I can change the indicator for TW in PLE, if that is what you are asking.
I'm not sure I understand what you are asking for on POI 56943.  Are you saying this point is valid for displacement and I should add it to the IT and SP displacement groups in PLE?  What does West Texas have to do with it??
POI 500168 is a delivery in PLE, not bi-directional.  If it physically does not flow both ways I can't change the indicator in PLE.  If you are scheduling due to displacement then it should be added to the displacement groups.

The following points need updating in PLE

1635 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE  as such to be picked up in TMS
56943 should be a displacement point on both IT and SP groups in West Texas
500168 is scheduled as a bi-directional point so we need to label in PLE as such to be picked up in TMS

Gentlemen,
 I need to schedule 2 hrs. down time ( zero flow ) for sta. 010169-01 TW / TransColorado I/C ( Blanco Hub receipt ). Starting at 09:00 MST on 3-19-02.
We are going change out a 12"" turbine meter out, and visually inspect the meter tube. Rick Downey with Kinder Morgan is scheduling this with his people as well. We should be able to make up the noms. pretty easily, as they always have plenty of line pressure and lots of gas.
Thanks,

We have been under burning at the Great Lakes - Carlton Interconnect for the past few days.   Gas Control was seeing what appeared to be a good flow rate but due to a calibration error between our Seimens Controller at Carlton and the Great Lakes computer we have actually been under burning.    The Control Tech - Roger Salmi - is performing a calibration now and we should be sync'd up with Great Lakes this afternoon.

I have passed this to Gas Control and they will make the necessary adjustments to correct the imbalance once Roger has completed the calibration.

Lorraine after looking over what volumes we'll be receiving we'll be needing a total sulphur instrument at this location. I understand NGPL has one at the Indian Basin Plant which is an Old Barton Recorder type. These type of instruments will not pick up all the sulphur we're experiencing out of the field in that area. We have instruments that will pick up butyl sulphur along with many others that most other companies equipment can't read at this time. We're also experiencing large amounts of butyl which is a major problem for us in the Atoka field. By receiving this into our system we're having to batch or inject corrosion inhibitor's in our pipelines for protection. This is a cost to operations that we need to get a handle on. Thanks for your help in this matter

Perry I agree with Arnie and the team. In order to keep our pipelines in good shape we need to know what we are receiving, especially from these larger delivery points. It seems like every time we agree to something different than what we require operations has to go back to marketing for dollars or put in equipment to correct the situation. We're trying to cover all bases up front so this doesn't happen in the future.

Subject:	RE: NGPL Eddy Co.   << OLE Object: StdOleLink >> 

Perry,
The Artesia Team and I still have concerns about having no total sulfur monitor at the location.  We are already taking gas that has high total sulfur at Atoka 2.  Since we have started using sulfur instruments that pick up Butyl Sulfur, we are almost always over .75 grains at Atoka 2 into the West Texas lateral.  The instruments that NGPL uses at the Indian Basin plant may not see Butyl Sulfurs.  If this it the case, we may have the same problem that we have at Atoka 2.  If we don't have enough other inputs to blend the gas, this can become a quality problem for deliveries at other locations. 
Since this is a 50mmcfd input to our system, I sure think we need the protection.
Thanks,  Arnie

Subject:	RE: NGPL Eddy Co.

Laura & Earl:

Planning and Gas Control can accept control valve operation by NGPL, which is included in the current drawings.  The installation of 2 control would give us problems with them fighting each other.  We have an OBA with NGPL, and we will monitor their future compliance to volume requirements.   We might have to address in this in the future if the fail to comply, but for now we're okay.

NGPL has basically the same tariff as TW and they feel protected from total sulfur at the tailgate of the Indian Basin Plant.  The Delmar H2S at the NGPL/TW point  will protect us both from H2S.  We may want to grab a sample from the IB plant to baseline the current sulfur content and verify accuracy.  Darrell and myself are comfortable with the current plans, to not install total sulfur at our interconnect with NGPl.  The cost of this new instrument is around $40,000 and I don't believe either company has plans to replace,  NGPL total sulfur instrument.

Arnie and Terry, please review and let us know if Operations can comply with our findings.  I am sure this can be resolve to our mutual agreement.

They had a 35,000 order and Kieth put the setpoint in at the mainline.  They sent a schedule for what they intended to pull hourly and
he didn't look at it.  I got with him yesterday and explained how the spread sheet works they send us and how to figure the hourly takes 
for a 24 hr period.  Guess I should'nt assume they know to do that.  I will take the to do to get with each gas controller again and explain
how Griffith works both at the power plant controls and the mainline.

We need to keep our communications open to the plant.  I know that during their test mode they have had a variance in load projections.
Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady.  
Ken,
Sorry about yesterday.  Thanks to your quick responce to our gas control so we could correct the problem before the plant
went down.  
If you have any more questions please call.

	SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT...........LYNDA


Subject: Fwd: A wonderful Message by George Carlin- of all people!

          The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller
          buildings but shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower
          viewpoints.

          We spend more, but have less. We buy more, but enjoy less.

          We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences,
          but less time.

          We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less
          judgment, more
          experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less wellness.

          We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh
          too little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get
          up too tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too
          seldom.

          We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values.

          We talk too much, love too seldom, and hate too often.

          We've learned how to make a living, but not a life.

          We've added years to life not life to years.

          We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble
          crossing the street to meet a new neighbor.

          We conquered outer space but not inner space.

          We've done larger things, but not better things.

          We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul.

          We've conquered the atom, but not our prejudice.

          We write more, but learn less.

          We plan more, but accomplish less.

          We've learned to rush, but not to wait.

          We build more computers to hold more information, to produce more
          copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.

          These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and
          small character, steep profits and shallow relationships.

          These are the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier
          houses, but broken homes.

          These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway
          morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do
          everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill.

          It is a time when there is much in the showroom window and
          nothing in the stockroom.

          A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time
          when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit
          delete.

          Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are
          not going
          to be around forever.

          Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe,
          because
          that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.

          Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that
          is the only treasure you can give with your heart and it doesn't
          cost a cent.

          Remember, to say, ""I love you"" to your partner and your loved
          ones, but most
          of all mean it.  A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it
          comes from deep inside of you.

          Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that
          person will not be there again.  Give time to love, give time to
          speak and give time to share the precious thoughts in your mind

Subject:	Kingman Mock Emergency

Darryl can you use this as your senario cards...    What I think we should do is as follows:  I will give you a call at 11:30 CST insuring that you are at the gas control board.  I will call you on your cell phone (713-826-4223) and stay in contact with you for the first 10 minutes or so.  When all the players are in place (Mangement, Local Emergency Planning Committee representative, you, etc....) I will initiate the drill by verbally telling you to start.  

At that point you will hand the controller on the board a note stating: 
1)  This is a mock situation, do you understand that this is a mock situation?  
2)  Tell the controller that with all communication they make from this point forward they will need to make it clear to start each message or phone call with ""This is a mock emergency do you understand."" 
3)  Pass out the first Step information on a piece of paper at the given time....
4)  Pass out the second Step information on a piece of paper at the given time....
5) and so on......


Step 1 -  11:30 CST 
Loss of pressure (and flow, if flowing) at the Citizens Kingman TBS.

Step 2 - 11:32 CST
Loss of pressure and flow to the Griffith power plant and North Star Steel.  (As Darryl and Tiny will be in continuous cell phone contact, Roger will now know that as Step two is handed to the controller he will need to initiate the call to the OCC simulating a call from a contractor that has hit our line.)  

Step 3 -  11:38  CST
Discharge pressure increasing quickly at Station 1.  Supply pressure slowly dropping at Needles and Calpine.  
(Trying to simulate mainline valve line break activation.  At least one of them.)

Assumption is that the OCC would notify Gas Control and Team????  (wait to see what happens from there)  Darryl make whatever modifications you feel would enhance this drill.  I know you are more familiar with what your folks should expect to see.  The main thing we are trying to simulate is a rupture on the Kingman TBS lateral which will activate a line break between the Kingman TBS and Station 1.  No line break down stream of the Kingman TBS will activate...  Therfore we will see the pressure dropping at Northstar, Griffith and eventually at Needles and on the Topack Lateral (Calpine, Mohave, and PG&E...)  Let me know your thoughts..   

Darryl and Tiny will remain in contact for a few more minutes and Roger will be on location with Tiny so we should have a closed loop on communications.  Arnie Bailey will monitor the conf. bridge from Roswell.  

Any questions give me a call as I will be in meetings for the next two days so drop me an e:mail or get me on my cell....  thanks....

Hi Shelley,

Through these stressful times of people moving around and the company restructuring and splitting out the pipelines, I strongly recommend that Darrell Schoolcraft remain with the TW pipeline group as manager/director of this pipeline group. He is very knowledgeable and very professional  in his duties as a coordinator and certainly would make an excellent  manager/director under any new restructuring plan. He's also been very helpful to me and others in maintaining a solid pipeline as well as keeping the lines of communication open between ourselves and our customers. Shelley, for whatever this is worth, he comes strongly recommended for this positon under any type of restructuring plan. Thanks.

Hi there David!

For now we are using the plant estimates you send us via email to determine
the maximum volume we need to confirm.  As the plant has updates thoughout
the day regarding when and how much will be pulled, you should contact our
Gas Control at 713-853-5533.  There will always be a Gas Controller on
call.  I will work primarily with Maryanne from Duke, Dave Smith from PPL
and our Gas Control to determine that scheduled volumes and actual flows do
not get too far out of whack.
Attached is the contact sheet we will be using in addition to the contact
list we have from our meeting out at the plant.
(See attached file: EAMRCitizensContacts.doc)
If you have anymore questions, email me back, or my phone number is
713-853-0439.
Thanks!
Amy Mulligan


   Effective August 1, 2001, Enron Asset Management Resources will be
   acting as agent for the Citizens Communications Company at the Griffith
   interconnects on both Transwestern and El Paso.  I will be the primary
   scheduler in charge of communicating with the plant regarding its needs,
   confirming the gas at both interconnects, managing the OBA's, and
   allocating flows to the owners of the plant.

   In order to ensure a smooth transition, I will probably be in close
   contact with each of you.  For the time being, we will use the burn
   estimates which come from the plant to determine our confirmed volumes
   on Transwestern and El Paso, as well as daily discussions we have with
   Duke, PPL, and our gas control.  In my absence, the rest of the
   Transwestern scheduling team will be trained to do the daily
   confirmations and work with gas control with regard to daily flows.

   Thank you for all your cooperation.  If you have any questions, please
   feel free to call me.

   Sincerely,
   Amy Mulligan

Please note that the original POI 500168 is active/valid in PLE and available to nominate as a receipt or delivery. The new point we set up for the Interconnect (78161) has been inactivated, and will not be valid for transport.

If you have questions, please advise.

Yes, the volumes for the two physical meters should be summed and passed to POI 500168 as a net number, just like NNG does on their sum meters.

Subject:	Change for Oneok Interconnect( Oneok Ward County)
Importance:	High

It has been proposed by Marketing that the new interconnect (TW/Oneok Ward County - POI 78161) be not used for nominations, but would be removed from our PLE system and that the old POI 500168 be set up as a bi-directional point for nomination purposes to accept both receipts and deliveries at that point.

All flow through physical meter #10187 (new TW/Oneok Ward County POI 78161) and meter #9089 (Existing TW/Oneok(Westar) Ward County POI 500168) will need to be summed and a new sum meter established for POI 500168.

Kevin:  Does this affect your interconnect agreement in any way?

Sigrid, can you please set up the sum meter and let me know what it is.

This change is to be in effect no later than Friday in order to be ready for September business.

If anyone has questions or concerns, please advise.

Can we use a summation meter for the POI 500168 Westar Ward County Meter # 9089 and Meter # 10187
We can make this a bi-directional point in our system.  This will make it transparent to our customers.

You are correct looking at the models Ken  Chow ran before he left was between 175 to 225  this will allow the pig to move
approx. between 5 to 6 miles an hour.

Darrell,
At Gallup last year it took about 250 mmcfd to run the pig 6 miles per hour.  If my memory is bad someone let me know.  If we can move that amount with 7 & 9 easily then there should be no problem.

Is there a reason we think we will need to run station 8.  I think with the volumes we will have to move to insure 6 miles and hour for the smart pig
will be approx. 100 to 200 m2.  If my thinking is wrong please let me know.

This is to advise that if we are now actively looking at rescheduling the smartpigging dates that was previously agreed upon at our Albuquerque mtg on April 11th, we need to know ASAP.  We do not have alot of flexibility in juggling schedules based on smartpig tool availability, but we can sure check and see what shakes out.

Plz let me know at the earliest possible date what the plans are here.

Thanks - Max

TW - Station 6-7 & Station 7-8 Smart Pigging - C.014524/C.014527
Project will conflict with Station 8 Automation Project if conducted in September or later.  Actively chasing TD Williams and PII for their cost estimates.  Must review costs to determine if dollars are sufficient.  Project should try to be a done in August or sooner if at all possible.

"RE: 24"" Pig","Right now guys we will do our best to keep the station on line however we can't predict what flows will be.  If we don't have 
the volumes we can't do it.
The gas prices so far for Oct. look higher going to Cal. border.  We will have to see if we have the volumes next week to 
run the pigs.  Sure would have been nice to have run pigs this week everyone could see that flows were up and we should
have taken advantage of this.  Again, we will take a look at all scenario's next week.

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron. 
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me."" 
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started. 
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985. 
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 
You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.
""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.
""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""

Ben,

This is what I got back from Darrell on what we need to operate this point.  I will be out of the office over the next several day but you call me at home (281-852-4304) or contact Darrell Schoolcraft at 713-853-4299 if you have any question or need more information.  You should call Sarabeth Smith or Don Hawkins if there is additional programming or hardware need to make this happen.  As soon as you have any register numbers please send them to George as soon as possible.  

Thank you
Dale

We need to be able to monitor everything there is to see just as we would monitor a TW on NNG interconnect.  
Along with the below mentioned items from Ben, we also need  All Accums, (previous and current 
mmbtu and mmcf), All Flows both MMbtu and MMcf. on all runs, 2"" rotary, 4"" turbine meter, 10"" ultra-sonic.
All available History info..  This information request is for monitoring TW and El Paso at the Griffith Site.
Gary, Steve, Dale please review and if you think we need anything else, now is the time to speak up.  We
need as much information as possible to insure a smooth transition for gas control.  From what TW is 
hearing we could take over the operation sometime next week.  
Dale once we have the additional requests, will you foward them to Ben or would you like me to.  I will be 
glad to help.

Dale,

I do not have the list of ""softpoints"" with me that are available to Gas Control from the Citizen's Fisher ROC, but generally remember it as follows:  (we can go over it point by point Friday when I return to Roswell if you would like)

TW & ElPaso's rotary meters: flow rate, current accum, prev accum, press and temp.
TW & ElPaso's turbine meters: no data
TW & ElPaso's ultrasonic meters: no data

TW & ElPaso's station results: totalized flow rate (it would be nice to have volume and energy accums)

All the station control registers look to be adequate.  All of the two state points that we normally would treat as Digital Inputs  are treated as Analog Input variables.

If these points are sufficient, it will be straight forward to map these to modbus registers.  If more points are required, we will need permission from Citizens to modify their FSTs.  As I stated on the conference call, this work is not difficult, but may be considered to be intrusive were we will be programming lines of code in the same area that their complex station control code resides.

Ben Tanner

We informed Ideal Electric this afternoon to start work on the Bisti replacement motor.  Josh Mayes has contacted Andrew Gagnon at Ideal with the P.O. information.  We were able to negotiate a three year warranty with the 6 week delivery.  Price will be $295,000 with a reduction in price of $30,000 to $35,000 if we can reuse the existing rotor and/or parts from the previously installed rotor.  We will need to ship the entire motor except for the top hat enclosure and the rotor at Roswell to Ideal.

Todd or Tiny, please ship the motor and spare rotor to Ideal Electric Company, 330 E. First Street, Mansfield, OH,  44902  Attn:  Andrew Gagnon, phone 419-522-3611.

Sarabeth or Josh,  please contact Ideal for a long term service contract.  Dan Pribble would like to know what this cost would be and he will decide if this option should be pursued.

Arnold, please send Andy at Ideal the information you have on the Gallup motor.  

Ideal is checking on the cost of a spare motor which would be good for both Bloomfield and Bisti.  Depending on what the Gallup specifications are, Ideal might be able to make the spare motor good for all three installations.  

We have informed Mark Knippa with ECS that due to the emergency situation that TW is leading the efforts to get Bisti back into service.  Mark will be in contact with us as to his negotiations with the Creditor's Committee on reimbursing TW for all costs.  I think Sarabeth will be our contact on these discussions?

I will be out of the office on Thursday and Friday.  Arnold Eisenstein will be available if any questions or concerns arise.  Thanks, Norm

Jeff, 

I agree also. I believe that is a really good idea. There will be times when it is necessary to run at, or close to MAOP to move the required flows, but we do not want to run over MAOP at anytime. So, anything they can do to protect the H.P. and the integrity of the pipe would be great.

Hello Jerry,

Everybody seems to be in agreement to this point.  I would like your comments.  What I propose to do is ask that the high pressure shutdowns be reset as close to MAOP as possible, without shutting anything down AT MAOP.  It may take a little adjustment to find out where that point is for each station.  Any problem?

Subject:	RE: protecting MAOP

Jeff,
The regulations are pretty clear.  192.619(a) says  "" . . no person may operate a segment of steel or plastic pipeline at a pressure which exceeds the lowest of the following: . . . "" and goes on to talk about design pressure, test pressure and highest operating pressure issues.  There is no leeway.  The regulations provide for the built in problem of buildup pressure in relief devices by giving us up to ten percent above MAOP to achieve full relief capacity, IF we need it due to failure of a pressure control device or system.  Operator error or roll back due to system demand changes are not acceptable justification for exceeding MAOP.

From the communications below, it looks like the high pressure shutdowns are being used more as a pressure control device than an overpressure protection device.  If this is to be the case, then the shutdowns must be set at the MAOP, not at some percentage above MAOP.  If this is done, then the relief valves must be sized adequately to prevent operating pressure to exceed the MAOP plus the allowable 10 percent buildup.  I believe that some compressors are relying on shutdown switches as primary OPP since existing relief valves are inadequately sized.  I don't know if this is the case here.

My thoughts are that if the operating pressure of a pipeline exceeds the MAOP by any amount, then the control systems should be recalibrated to prevent a reoccurrence.  If the control system has unacceptable dead band, then the economics should justify replacing it.  The economics cannot, under any circumstances, justify operating at any pressure that exceeds MAOP.

Pat

As you know, we have exceeded the MAOP a couple of times since I have been here.  According to the Advisors, our shutdowns for high discharge at the mainline stations are set at 1020.  This is 12 PSI over MAOP.  These shutdowns should prevent the pressure from ever getting high enough to actually blow a relief valve (at 10% over MAOP). 

Although we are allowed to set overpressure protection devices to prevent overpressuring by more than 10%,  I don't believe that this gives us permission to operate above MAOP.  My opinion is that we should set the high discharge shutdowns closer to MAOP so that rollbacks due to reduced demand, other conditions resulting in high line pack, or manipulation of pressure to excavate a line, don't result in us exceeding MAOP.   

I need to run this by Pat Vaughn, Gas Control, and probably a few others, but I thought I would start by running this by you.  Do you see any reason not to pursue this?

Jeff

"Griffith Power Plant on TW","As of Sunday, January 20, 2002 
Griffith Power plant located off of TW's mainline was declared operational for Commercial Usage to the Power Grid market.

Gas Control Issues:
Nominations:
Their could be nominations every day for flow from El Paso and TW depending on the price and transportation agreements
between Duke and PPL.
You will see a total nom for the TW side in your daily orders and the El Paso order will have to come from the TW logistics 
Team.

Flows:
We may have to batch the El Paso volumes depending on the nominations.  We will watch the noms this week to get a feel
of where and how much they may vary.  
As agents for Citizens under the EMAR umbrella, We will need to get with the El Paso controller and let them know that your
going to open their side to be Primary and start taking flow from them to accumulate the order.(If this looks like it is going to be
small volumes we may need to batch the gas and work with El Paso Controllers.)  
Currently at the Griffith Power Plant TW and El Paso screens the primary control set point is 1 (TW primary)  
When you need to flow from El Paso you will need to switch the service to 2 (El Paso primary), and flow the gas until accumed
and switch back to 1 (TW primary). 
If anyone has a question on this please call me and we can walk through it.  Again as EMAR we are to make the changes at the
Site from Gas Control.
The only time we should get the Citizens people involved with the I/C is if we have a problem with Primary switches or pressure
problems.  Please refer to the call out sheet on the Console for Citizens.

Please don't hesitate to call if you need help.

There continues to be a need for volumes scheduled as a delivery because this feeds a receipt to California.  As of 10/9, contract #26813 has deliveries of 28,098 and contract #27583 has receipts of 8,709.  Are you also telling me that North Star Steel is not burning anything?!?

Why is there currently a nom for delivery to North Star Steele.  It doesn't look like they have taken gas from us in a while since 10/1

or have they???

To: ALL EMPLOYEES

Due to the increased workload, the management has
decided that the company can no longer afford for you
to take time out of your schedule to go to the
restroom. Instead, to increase employee efficiency,
the company will shoulder the expense of remodeling
your cubicle to accommodate restroom privileges.

See your new cubicle layout (jpg attached)

Thank you for your cooperation

No matter how hard I try to get BVZ to include float in the schedule, to
allow for the ""unknown things"" which are bound to occur, they insist on the
most optimistic outcome and it never happens.

On Friday we will do the tests as detailed below.  After that there are
other tests which will take place before the plant goes commercial.

What seems to be the problem with start up.  When you do will you be in
more test phases or commercial.

   This schedule is for performance testing as follows:

   1) Cold Start Test
        Must bring the plant up to Base Load in less than 8 hours.
        Scheduled to start both CT's during HE 8:00

   2) Steam Turbine Trip Test:
        Scheduled to occur in HE 17:00 then bring CT back up to base.

   3) Operation at Minimum Load:
        Scheduled to occur  HE 21:00 to HE 22:00

   Special Request to DETM and WAPA for today to permit Griffith to change
   plant output without constraint as long as we strive to make the average
   MW
   shown on this schedule for each hour.  (This has been approved by Cal
   Ingram of WAPA)

   Note: If something happens and BVZ cannot stay on this schedule, then
   DETM
   can again call for limits on the timing of ramp up or down as required.

Darrell,
We have an EBS customer visit from Continental Airlines coming through tomorrow, Tuesday, July 3, 2001.  This visit is going through Joe Edwards, Director, EBS and Sarah-Joy Hunter, Director, GSS.

They are two people from their IT department coming in to discuss a Bandwidth deal. This is all the information I have at this time.  I do know that they are pretty far into their discussions and this could be a substantial deal for EBS

We wanted to give them an overview of Enron's pipeline business (approx. 15 minutes max).  

They would arrive at 1:30 pm.

Please let me know.

Thanks!

"Re: Pigging from P-2 to P-3","I spoke to the guys in the field last week when our deliveries went up and we made the decision to run
the pigs.  It was passed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streams
possibly coming from the Bitter Lakes and Red Bluff points.  I had them pull moisture readings and they
were well below TW's  #7 of water.  They said it was more like drip.  This heavies are in the gas stream
that is falling out and collecting in the pipe.  I agree that we need to run pigs when we have the volumes.
We in gas control will continue to work with the field to make that happen.
If I have the wrong impression on what is happening I apologize.  Please let me know.

Thanks DS

Subject:	Re: Pigging from P-2 to P-3   

Randy, I agree we should continue to pig the line until the liquids have been cleared out then pig it on a regular basis. We would just have to work with Darrell Schoolcraft on TW operations and NNG operations to make it happen. Their may be days that it just does not work  on one side or the other  but once the line is cleared out of liquids we should be able to find a day on a bi-weekly or monthly basis to make it happen. We will work with you any way we can. Also, I'm sure it probably has already been looked into but is there anything that  can be done as to the location the condensate is coming from or could something be done at P-2 to catch it before it goes up the Panhandle lateral.

Subject:	Pigging from P-2 to P-3

Gary, we recently had to run a pig from P-2 to P-3 in order to push about 2200 barrels of condensate out of the line.  We had started developing problems with some deliveries off that line.  Apparently, in order to run a pig, some volume has to be routed to that line.   I understand that there are some marketing and gas control issues when we do this, but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this off or postpone it:

The condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with Energas.  This point feeds some domestic customers.  We don't want condensate getting into this point.
There is a customer on this line (Owens-Corning) who gets fuel from us.  Their process is very sensitive to pressure and volume changes.  At any given time, I am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production.  If they lose fuel, the product is lost and we could be liable.  I am also told that once the plant goes down, it could take a long time (even weeks) to get it back up.
The Owens-Corning plant does not have an agreement with anyone for alternate fuel.  When the line has large amounts of condensate, we have been asking Energas to supply the plant until the pig passes the point.  This is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from affecting the fuel pressure.  The gas from Energas is NOT measured.  They used to have the contract, but when we got it, they removed their meter setting.  Apparently they agreed (verbally) to supply gas to the plant in March, for a few hours, when a pig was run.  The plant uses about 3 mmcf/d and Energas was on for about 3 hours.  I was notified today that Energas sent us a bill for the March pig run when we used their gas for fuel.....$21,000!  Obviously we will negotiate that amount, but they have us at a disadvantage.  I can only assume that we will receive a similar bill for using them last weekend for about 3 hours.
Everyone feels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule, we would not get large condensate amounts into P-3 (which shuts us down, by the way), we would not have to use Energas, we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point, and we would not incur the overtime when this happens.

I'm sure Rich has some concerns also for the portion of the line in his region.
We would like to run another pig as soon as possible to see what is left in the line and then (depending on what we push into P-3) get on a regular schedule...possibly once a month.
What do you think we can do to work something out?
Thanks for any help you can give us.

The pigs arrived at Gallup about 1:00 pm, and were pulled  out of the trap for inspection. We found very little
liquid and about a gallon of yellow chalk looking powder. The pigs showed to be worn some, and that may indicate
 there was not liquid in the line.  We blew the scrubber before and after the pigs arrived and found no liquid in it. We will
go ahead and run another set of pigs om Monday 10/15/01 and we let everyone know the results then. We are going to send the samples we pulled into the Lab. next week, if you have any questions please give use a call..........Gallup Team..Pat

Subject:	TW Daily Balance Report

Please see attached SUMMARY-ONLY version of TW Daily Balance Report.

 

I wanted to let you know that I have consulted the leading experts in the field, and all of my son Matthew's textbooks (he's seven), and arranged the letters of the alphabet in their proper order. Whew! The formula notations have been corrected to reflect this new-world-order. I will forward to all of you explanations of the formulas this week.

Remember, the far-right columns R,S and T are still being worked on! Don't bet your house on them.

As always, call me if you have any questions.

Thanks!

As the efficiencies of the lateral (between Bloomfield and Gallup) steadily decrease it is time to probably think about pigging that section again in time for the upcoming tariff season. We will be scheduling a meeting next week to talk about the following:
1)	When should we do this?
2)	Should we also consider surfactant cleaning?
3)	It has been almost 6 months since the application of the DRA on that section. Should we re-apply?
4)	What are the costs-outages, cost of app
5)	What are the benefits.

Please let John Sturn or myself know of when you cannot make a meeting next week.
Thanks

	I would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the
	procedure Transwestern is using today for the SoCal Needles ""window"" allocation.

	Some of the questions being asked:

	1.  Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?

	2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary firm?

	3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?

	I am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well.  We are looking
	at Tuesday, July 24, at 9:00 a.m or Wednesday, July 25, 1:30 p.m.

	Please let Ava Garcia (713-853-5842) know which day is better for you.  Then we will
	get a room and let everyone know date and time.

I talked to Jim about this today. He is going to contact the transformer people (Virginia) to see what they recommend. Jim is thinking they should stand behind this repair since it is a manufacturing problem. Since we are in tariff and no urgent problem exists at this time, maybe gas control will give us 8 hours in September to make the repairs.
Sorry it took so long to respond but this one got lost in my e-mail.
Thanks for your help Jim. We will talk again in week or so.

Subject:	TW Station 1 Heat Recovery

Daryl,  I thought it may be more efficient to compose my question in an e-mail.

I am developing a project at this station in which the exhaust from the new LM 2500 gas turbine could be used to generate up to 15 megawatts of electricity.  After several weeks of engineering and financial analysis, I am now beginning to market the project to prospective counter-parties including local utilities and cooperatives. 

One issue that will certainly be discussed is the risk of the LM 2500 not producing enough exhaust to generate the contracted amounts of electricity.  This could occur because of either mechanical failure or loss of throughput in Transwestern's pipeline.  In the latter case, Transwestern could choose several alternatives to transport reduced volumes of gas to the CA border including reducing the horsepower in some or all stations uniformly or shutting down and bypassing some stations while others run at normal speed.  If I did this deal, naturally, I would want Station 1 to run as much as possible so I would have the exhaust needed to generate the electricity I've sold.  Otherwise I pay penalties.

My question to you is...  if volumes through TW were to decline, say 25% or so below design rate, would it be possible to keep Station 1 going at 100% and cut other stations back or does that just not make any sense?

Come by when you're ready and we'll discuss.

Thanks,

John

At the moment the Griffith Facility is still shut down because of a valve
failure in the steam system.

The earliest anticipated need for gas would be Saturday morning, July 28.

The task at startup will be to blow steam through the system at high
velocity in order to purge possible debris from steam lines.  In this
situation, gas will be needed but electric power will not be produced.

I will update everyone tomorrow morning on our plans for the weekend.

Attached is a project schedule for the month of June indicating station outages and further defining project needs for Power Services personnel.  The letters like S1, S2,... indicate location of each person.  This is a tentative schedule and and personnel and purpose is subject to change depending on information gathered by Analysts.

Unit 401 outage scheduled on June 6th requires that unit to be down for some time.  Analysis performed last Thursday indicates there are unloaders that are definitely not operating or leaking significantly.  Presently, it is unknown what kind of problems will be uncovered on inspection of the unloaders.  Information on the malfunctioning unloaders will be distributed as soon as inspections are completed Wednesday.

 

Should there be any questions, please call me on my cell phone:  806-886-8105

Subject:	ElPaso Waha Problems

Ron from NNG Gas Control called around 7:00 pm.m informing me that ElPaso has a turbine down creating high pressure, NNG can't deliver the gas at Waha. I confirmed the gas to 0 for the next cycle (eve cycle) in ElPaso. but did not cut any for gas day 10/8/01. The gas for tomorrow is sourcing from Altura so please contact them in the A.M. and let them know the shipper was cut ot zero. Gas Control was able to deliver gas yesterday because the pressure wasn't as high as it is now. Evidently this outage started on the 7th and is scheduled to last through the 12th. NNG probably shouldn't allow nominations at Waha until the outage is completed. 
NGTS contract 107848 was the only Shipper nominated for tomorrows gas day. EPNG will try to get the pressure down to allow us to flow to them, but won't know that until later, or tomorrow. 
(Reliant has a nom on NNG side, but not in ElPaso' system)


Also, Darrell (the allocatin' dude) decided to allocate Linam Ranch (ID2 cycle) down to 100,000 because they were not making rate since last Friday. In cutting the Linam Ranch Point the Hobbs system Group was not allocated on the ID2 cycle. 

so far my first night back has been rather exicting!!

I have changed the point / group lookup when posting TW notices through the Informational Postings Administration Utility.  It now takes the group information from the CAS system instead of PLE.  Please take a look at it to make sure it looks right.

Go to http://172.30.200.203/ebbadmin/notices/default.htm and log on as ""ebbadmin"",""august2000"".  Go to enter a new TW allocation and press the ""POI/Lateral"" button from the notice detail window.  The point information is now taken from the new PLE system and the group information is now taken from the new CAS system.

Subject:	Caliper Tool Run on Section 5

Team Gallup,
We will be running the TD Williams caliper tool in section 5 (both lines) during the week of August 27th.  This run is a free run from TD Williams to try to lock down the locations of the dents in both lines near station 4 that we were unable to locate during the dig outs.  Prior to running the tools, we need to do two pig runs in each line for cleaning.  Hopefulling it can be done during the week of the 20th.
I've spoken with Gary Choquette and he requests to be informed before and after each pig run so he can check efficiencies.  
Please let me know for sure that these pigs can be run during the stated time frames, and also if you will need support help.  I think you indicated that you would need 2 people during the week of the 27th.

Darrell,
No flow restrictions will be needed for these pig runs.  The pigs, including the caliper tool can run at any speed.  We will need at lease 120mmcfd flow through station 5 to keep the pigs moving.  Do you see a problem?
Also, during the week of August 20th, we will be running the TD Williams caliper tool in the mainlines in sections 7 and 8  (station 8 all the way to station 6).  Again we will need enough flow to keep the pigs running, preferably 200mmcfd or more.  Do you see any problem?

Thanks,  Arnie

3,000/day is being schedule at Wolf Creek and we are not receiving volume thus increasing Continental's imbalance.

Should we be allowing this volume to be scheduled?

Subject:	Pigging of SJ - Bloomfield to Gallup

As the efficiencies of the lateral (between Bloomfield and Gallup) steadily decrease it is time to probably think about pigging that section again in time for the upcoming tariff season. We will be scheduling a meeting next week to talk about the following:
1)	When should we do this?
            Ben can your group figure what volume loses we are incurring as the percentage of efficiency goes down? After that we need to get marketing involved and 
            let them tell us when to pig the line and add new inhibitor. 
2)	Should we also consider surfactant cleaning?
            This will have to be looked at but only after running pigs to see what condition the pipeline is in. 
3)	It has been almost 6 months since the application of the DRA on that section. Should we re-apply?
            Again this is dependent on revenue loss compared to percentage loss and marketing will have to be involved.
4)	What are the costs-outages, cost of app
            This is dependent on what all we will be doing. If we add surfactant the cost will be quite a bit more. How many times do we run the pigs to get the line ready 	(we don't know this.) We'll need to work with Darrell Schoolcraft and marketing on outages. Cost of application we can get this from Nalco.
  5)	What are the benefits.
            Getting back to 7% increase in efficiency. 

           I'll be in a meeting in Oklahoma next week but will be available for a call.

Thanks
RJ

Please let John Sturn or myself know of when you cannot make a meeting next week.

At the moment the plant is down waiting for delivery of parts to repair
steam valves.  Parts may arrive this afternoon but there is no guarantee.
BVZ have no schedule for startup and therefore no gas has been nominated
for the weekend.

When the plant is ready to start up, operation will be based on gas
availability at the time.

All units should be capable of operating.  Expect to be able to get to base
load approximately 24 hours after startup.

Attached is a copy of the preliminary report that  recommends that the inlet pressure to Citizens ""Griffith Plant"" Station be  limited to 740 psig.  Note that this is only a preliminary report that  Citizens is reviewing.  Some of our ""reviewers"" are on vacation, and have  held up the process of getting this report finalized.
 
Since  I was temporarily assigned to another position during the time that gas was  introduced to this line, I have asked my employee Martin Conboy to create a log  of events on how these stations had been operated.  I will send it to you  later today.  
 
Can  you have David Roensch review to see if anything is missing.  I feel that  it is a good idea to document the different operation modes with results prior  to agreeing on any further changes.

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.

The lo pressure alarm on the analog page for the downstream pressure going to the Griffith plant from TW's mainline 
has been reset at 800#.  
The lo lo pressure alarm is set at 750#.
Reason:  This should give you time to react to possible low pressure concerns in the 3 to 4 miles of pipe from mainline to 
              Griffith plant and hopefully prevent any plant upsets.  This is for our protection.  You may need to raise the
              setpoint.
For call outs for alarms TW operations is responsible. 

If anyone does not agree with this please let me know and we can discuss.

Griffith Power Plt. El Paso and TW (CITZ)

We monitor these two sites as EMAR for Citizens.  Remember anytime you receive alarms on these points you refer
to the call out list for Citizens.  If you have questions please refer to the handout you received or call me.
The plant is currently down and planning on coming on line and commercial Tuesday September 11.
There are still some questions on which is the better way to set the site for flows.  Let me know what you think of 
setting TW on pressure control and El Paso on flow control.  
Reason:  TW pressure is higher and with El Paso on flow control this will allow TW to take the swing when Griffith
              has orders from both pipelines.  Let me know of your experience with this and let's discuss and write up  
              some guidelines for us to follow.

The pig runs on the Panhandle Lateral this week were a success.  Liquids received are as follows:
P-1 - 500 bbls
P-2 - 500 bbls
P-3 - 350 bbls
We really appreciate everyone's efforts to make this happen as smoothly as possible.  It's a lot of work from the teams and a lot of trouble for gas control to get the gas flows needed, but still necessary to do.
I suggest we look at pigging the lateral again during the week of Sept. 10th.  This time we will need to run a pig from Sta. 9 to the Pecos River on Monday and then sweep the river crossing.  The run from the river to P-1 would be Tuesday, P-1 to P-2 on Wednesday and P-2 to P-3 on Thursday.  Let me know if you have other thoughts on this.

Darrell,
Per our phone conversation this morning, I'm requesting gas to run pigs on the Panhandle Lateral next week.
Preferred Schedule:
  Tuesday - 8-14-01 - River to P-1
  Wednesday - 8-15-01 - P-1 to P-2
  Thursday - 8-16-01 - P-2 to P-3
I spoke with Tony Teakell and he said they can run the pig from P-2 to P-3, even with short notice.
If you and/or Gary can't get the flows at these times, contact us as soon as you know, so we can work around it.
Thanks,  Arnie

This is a correction to the Trailblazer outage, the outage has been rescheduled for Nov. 8 and is an outage on NNG side of the pipe.
Per Gary this outage has been worked out between both Trailblazer and our Gas Controls to not affect throughput.

Subject:	LATE NIGHT NOTES

ID2:		Had to manually schedule Northwest CR 20786/24954, PNM CR 20785/25397, and TW CR 22948 because the receipt 		points were considered invalid.  The system EPSQ'd all the volumes down to 50%.  I didn't have any problems with the 		Northwest or PNM contracts, but I had to trace the TW admin contract all the way down the West Texas and Central 		pools.  I was able to reinstate a lot of the gas, but Astra's ended up at Socal and part of Richardson's gas ended up at 		Socal and PG&E.  Sempra's went to Calpine, Reliant went to Southwest Gas Mojave, and USGT's went to both Rio 			Puerco 	and Westar Ward so I fixed their volumes.

		I had to manually fix Williams' CR 24925 and Texaco's CR 25923/25924 due to variances at El Paso Blanco and 			Mojave, respectively.  Williams was off by 1 MMBtu while Texaco netted to zero.  West of Thoreau scheduled to 			938,382 and San Juan at 772,209.  I confirmed the scheduled volumes with Gas Control for all the points involved.

EVE:		Had to manually schedule the Northwest and PNM Hub contracts again.  I did not touch the gas sales on the admin 			contract.  Hopefully it will schedule in the Non-Grid.  ANR is slightly off, and one Northwest Receipt changed by 1 on 		cycle 3.  The Northwest delivery from Milagro should schedule on the Non-Grid.  I submitted the volumes to WFS as if 		they did schedule on the Evening.

NON-GRID:	Confirmed down USGT's 27161 at Halley since NNG did not have a nomination in their system.  I got caught up trying 		to fix the Hub contracts that I did not notice the problem on the Evening cycle especially since Debra is working for 			the South end.  I nominated the payback volume on ANR's OBA for 15,000 on the 19th as well as the 20th through 			22nd.  I also confirmed the volumes for each day.  Check to make sure I am going in the right direction.  At least the 		system didn't get hung up during the confirmations like they did over the weekend.

If you need me on Tuesday, call me at home or page me.  I plan to work Wednesday night unless someone tells me otherwise.

Subject: TW Capacity Affected for Red Rock Tie-ins 



The following volumes are capacities west of Station 1 that will result from tie-in construction work slated for the Red Rock expansion.  Tie-in assemblies will be required on both the Mainline and Loopline at stations 1, 2, and 3.  New block and side valve assemblies for new compressor and scrubbers will be installed on the suction side main and loop lines at each station.  The tie-in will entail blocking (isolating) a line segment within the station yard on the suction side (each line done separately) thus creating a dead leg back to the next upstream block valve crossover(s).  Hence, all of the flow will be forced into a single line when making tie-in on the adjacent pipeline line.  The result of forcing all volumes into a single line will produce greater pressure losses in the operating segment to the existing compression and reduce throughput due to lower suction pressure and respective horsepower limitations.  Discharge piping at the station having tie-in work will be unchanged regarding valving configurations.

Below is Griffith plant gas consumption data for yesterday 9/3/01.
You can see that from the time of loss of gas pressure, HE 8:00, we did not
recover until HE 14:00.
This of course extended our test schedule which required even more gas for
the day.

Note: Duct Burner #2 instrumentation is defective, otherwise the data is
OK.

Subject:	Outage update on unit 103 at station 1

On may 26th unit 103 went down on high bearing temp #4 main bearing. In the last two weeks this bearing has been changed two other times due to high temp problems. The last time the bearing was changed Roy Smith identified a high spot in the saddle area. This would cause a heavier load on the bearing and would result in temp problems. Today (Monday 28th) we worked on cleaning up the high spot. We also identified that the bearing that was installed also had a bonding problem. The babbitt on the bearing was pealing off. We then installed a bearing and took a complete set of deflection readings. The readings on number 2/10 throws indicated that the #4 main bearing is not over loaded. How ever the readings on numbers 7/15 indicate that #14 main is loaded heavy and might explain why this bearing is running higher then normal. Tomorrow ( Tuesday 29th.) we plan on making some adjustments to the chocks to relieve some of the load. 
  On Tuesday and Wednesday the Kingman team will be changing a turbo and after cooler. Myself and Roy Smith and two Tehas crew members will be working on the main bearings. We should have the alignment and bearing problem resolved by the time the turbo work is complete.

Subject:	Smart Pig Runs In Sections 7 & 8

On Tuesday we ran a PII smart pig in section 8 (Station 8 to Station 7) and on Thursday ran the smart pig in section 7 (Station 7 to Station 6).  Both runs appear to be successful.  The data will be forwarded to PII in Houston and a preliminary report will be ready in 2 to 3 weeks.  The final report will take 3 months.  
I would like to thank The teams from Montainair, Roswell and Laguna, the support help from teams Panhandle and Flagstaff, the Albuquerque Corrosion Specialist, and the Roswell Construction & Engineering group for their dedicated efforts to see the project completed.  Long days and short nights don't seem as bad when you've performed well and accomplished the goal.
I would also like to give special thanks to Darrell and the gas controllers for creating the right gas flows for a constant smooth run when the demand in California wasn't there for the gas.  You did an excellent job!
Have a great week-end.
Arnie

Gentlemen,
In preparation to comply with the Operator Qualification Rule, we need to schedule a training session for your OQ evaluators.  I know that you have reviewed the SBP Verifier Training CBT module, but we think that a better approach for non-SBP personnel would be a live trainer who can present the responsibilities of the evaluator from the perspective of the OQ rule.  The instructor we have in mind has a very good understanding of both the regulatory requirements of OQ and the process of skills evaluation.

I expect this training session to take no more than a day.  Please let me know a couple of dates when this class could be presented to the personnel of your choice.  Once we know how many people and when to schedule classes, we'll contact the instructor.  (Trainer is not available the last week of February and the first week of March)   Please reply within the next week so that we can reserve time on the instructor's schedule.

Call if you have questions or concerns.  (713-345-6857)
