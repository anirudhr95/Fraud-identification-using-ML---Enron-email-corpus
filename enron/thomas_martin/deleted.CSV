"Energy Derivatives/Electric Power Seminars","Quick question:

I was wondering if you know anyone who could benefit
from a better understanding of energy derivatives, risk
 management policy, gas-to-electricity arbitrage, statistics or
 electric power trading.

 If you do, please make them aware of  PGS Energy Training's
upcoming seminars in downtown Houston (in February) and
downtown Philadelphia (March).
 http://www.pgsenergy.com/schedule.html

Available seminars include:
    1) Fundamentals of Energy Futures, Options & Derivatives
    2) Fundamentals of the Electric Power Industry
    3) Gas-to-Electricity Arbitrage & How to Maximize the
        Profitability of Electric Generation Assets
    4) Developing Effective Risk Management Policies
        & Procedures (John Wengler)
    5) Fundamentals of Statistical Analysis (Dr. Ken Skinner)
    6) How to Value Electric Generation Assets as Real Options
    7) Fundamentals of Value-at-Risk (Soli Forouzan)

For seminar dates and hotel information, call 412-279-9298
or visit  http://www.pgsenergy.com/schedule.html

 You can also save money by bringing a group of 4 or more.
 With a group rate, your cost for $1,295 seminars is reduced

Six Meetings Cited Between Enron Corp. And Officials of Bush Energy Task Force

WASHINGTON -- Enron Corp. executives met six times last year with officials of the Bush administration's energy task force, though they did not talk about the energy company's finances, Vice President Dick Cheney's office said in a letter to Capitol Hill. 
One of the meetings included a 30-minute session between the vice president and Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay that had been previously disclosed. In addition, Enron officials met in large and small group meetings with the task-force staff. Two of the meetings occurred after the staff completed writing its report, including one as late as Oct. 10 -- days before Enron began its rapid slide into bankruptcy court.
""None of these meetings included a discussion of the financial position of the Enron Corporation,"" David Addington, the vice president's legal counsel, wrote in a letter Thursday to Rep. Henry Waxman of California, ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee. 
Mr. Addington, who was responding to a request from Mr. Waxman for information on Enron's contacts with members of the energy task force, provided few details. He suggested all of the meetings were consistent with the Energy Policy Development Group's plan to conduct ""meetings with a broad representation of people potentially affected by the Group's work."" 
Nonetheless, these newly disclosed contacts are likely to become grist for further congressional inquiry as half a dozen committees plan oversight hearings into the failure of the giant energy-trading company. Next month, the Senate Government Affairs Committee expects to open hearings on Enron. Committee Chairman Joseph Lieberman (D., Conn.) said at a news conference last week that he wanted to explore, among other things, whether Enron influenced administration energy policy. 
The letter produced a swift response from Mr. Waxman, who wrote the vice president yesterday asking for more detail. The first response, he said, ""raises additional questions about the extent to which Enron may have influenced the administration's energy policies or provided information about its own operation."" For example, Mr. Waxman noted that the day after Mr. Cheney met privately with Mr. Lay, the vice president stated his opposition to electricity price caps in California, a position that Enron had espoused previously. 
Mr. Waxman said the response did not provide names of participants other than the vice president, nor did it mention the subject of the meetings, any requests for policy changes and copies of any documents or e-mail communications between Enron and the administration. 
White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said task force members conducted the meetings to learn as much as possible about energy issues. The meetings, she said, were held by the staff with ""many, many groups across a broad range of interests to insure they had a thorough understanding"" of the topic. She said that the White House was committed to cooperating with members of Congress reviewing the Enron situation ""provided they are not pursuing open-ended investigations or fishing expeditions."" 
Enron, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas, filed for bankruptcy-court protection following a crisis of confidence among its investors. The problems have resulted largely from Enron's dealings with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives. The company saw its market value plunge recently to about $540 million from more than $77 billion last year.

Democrats squeeze information from White House on Enron-Cheney meetings

Democrats squeeze information from White House on Enron-Cheney meetings 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Because of Enron Corp.'s sudden bankruptcy, congressional Democrats have won their first victory in a nine-month effort to squeeze information from the Bush White House on its ties to the energy industry. 
For the first time, the White House is acknowledging that Enron representatives met six times with Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides on energy issues last year, most recently in mid-October just before the investing public realized the company was heading for disaster. 
Since last April, Cheney had fended off congressional requests for the identities of business executives and lobbyists who met with the White House as the administration formulated its pro-industry energy plan. 
The picture changed when Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., began pressing the White House about last month's crash of Enron, whose CEO, Ken Lay, is among President Bush's biggest political supporters. 
The vice president's office said the last Enron meeting with a Cheney aide was Oct. 10, just six days before the first in a series of public admissions by the company about its true financial condition that sent it careening into bankruptcy court.

Enron reps met 6 times with Cheney, staff / Letter to L.A. congressman likely to increase controversy

Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides met six times with Enron Corp. executives while the administration crafted its energy policy, Cheney's office revealed in a letter made public yesterday, fueling criticism over the energy company's White House influence. 
The letter to Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, from Cheney counsel David S. Addington, came after a standoff that has threatened to escalate into a court battle.
But rather than quell the furor, the letter's limited disclosures appeared likely to lend ammunition to critics seeking to link Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy to the administration. Waxman called the letter helpful but insufficient. 
""The vice president has given us a letter with some of the information we requested about the energy task force,"" Waxman told The Chronicle yesterday. ""I think that's useful to have, but it only gives us some answers, and I think we need a lot more."" 
Until now, the administration has refused repeated congressional requests to disclose whom the Cheney-led task force met with to form its energy policy. Comptroller General David Walker is expected to make a decision later this month on whether to sue to request the task force's internal documents. 
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest corporation, collapsed in a mire of dubious financial maneuvers, dealing a major blow to thousands of employees and stockholders and sparking an uproar on Capitol Hill. 
Eight separate congressional investigations into the company's business dealings have started, and many Democrats vow extensive probes into Enron's relationship to the administration, especially former Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay's close ties to President Bush. Lay was a longtime Bush fund-raiser, and he and Enron were major contributors to Bush's presidential campaign. 
""Enron was a major player in the energy issue, we saw them actively involved in California, and we need to find out what influence they had over the administration's energy policy and whether people in the administration knew what was going on in Enron before its collapse,"" Waxman said. ""This is going to be an ongoing investigation of a major financial catastrophe."" 
The letter from Cheney's counsel released by Waxman's office, which is dated Jan. 3, said Lay had met with Cheney April 17 for a half hour. The letter said the two had discussed ""energy policy matters, including the energy crisis in California, and did not discuss information concerning the financial position of Enron Corp."" 
The letter responded to Waxman's Dec. 4 request for Cheney to ""release information about secret contacts your energy task force had with Enron Corporation. . . . In light of Enron's financial collapse, it is important to know whether Enron communicated pertinent facts about its financial situation to the task force."" 
Addington noted that Cheney had revealed the meeting with Lay in a May 17 interview on the television program ""Frontline."" 
Bush appointed the Cabinet-level task force, called the National Energy Policy Development Group, to develop the administration's energy policy, which leaned heavily toward boosting supplies, including the controversial proposal to open the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. The task force was formed Jan. 29, issued its report in early May and shut down Sept. 30. 
The letter said the group's support staff had met with ""a broad representation of people potentially affected by the group's work,"" including energy companies, environmental advocacy groups, regulators, unions, researchers and other parties. 
But top environmental groups had complained bitterly that they were shut out of its deliberations. 
""We had one meeting with the vice president a month after the report was released,"" said David Hawkins, director of the National Resource Defense Council's climate center, which has also filed a lawsuit to force the task force to hand over documents. 
""I know that the environmental groups' leadership asked repeatedly for a meeting with the vice president before the plan was released, and we never got that meeting,"" Hawkins said, adding that they had been allowed one meeting with the task force staff. 
The letter released yesterday by Waxman's office said Enron representatives had met with the task force's executive director twice, on Feb. 22 and March 7. The staff met April 9 with representatives of two dozen utilities, including Enron. 
Two more meetings with Enron took place after the report was released, the letter said, including an Oct. 10 meeting with the former task force executive director, who had moved to the vice president's staff. The letter said neither meeting had any discussion of Enron's financial position. 
Addington played down the meetings, noting that Cheney had met with Lay only once and disclosed the meeting on television in May, and that none of the meetings had discussed the company's finances. 
Critics were unmoved, however, saying the administration was continuing to stonewall. 
""This is one of these things where just hiding the information continues to make the story worse and worse,"" Hawkins said. ""And dribbling it out by saying, 'OK, we'll tell you some of the people we met with such as Enron,' leaves the question, . . . why can't they tell us about meetings with other industry representatives?"" 
The vice president's office did not return requests for a response.

Big Banks Seeking Enron's Energy-Trading Business
By JONATHAN D. GLATER

The New York Times
Page 4, Column 3
c. 2002 New York Times Company

Several financial institutions and companies, including Citibank, UBS and BP, have indicated a serious interest in buying the energy-trading business of the bankrupt Enron Corporation, according to people involved in setting up an auction of the business. Each company was required to put up a $25 million deposit to bid for all or part of the operation, according to court documents. 
An Enron spokeswoman, Karen Denne, would not comment on the number of bidders or their identity. ''All we're saying is that we received multiple bids,'' she said.
There were conflicting reports from different sources yesterday of additional interested buyers, and one lawyer whose client will be involved in the auction said that other companies might submit bids even though the official deadline had passed. The auction is scheduled to take place tomorrow. ''We have the ability to be flexible,'' the lawyer said. 
Trying to buy a piece of Enron is not as surprising as it may sound, according to analysts who follow energy trading and Enron's business. What is valuable in a trading operation, according to one analyst whose firm is involved in the bankruptcy proceedings, is not just the tangible assets -- the computers, proprietary software and other necessary tools of trading -- but the experience of its employees. And surprisingly few employees have left the trading operation of Enron North America, a subsidiary. 
More than 500 employees remain, including researchers, traders and analysts whose job it is to determine what the price of a given transaction should be, Ms. Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said. ''There has been a real effort to keep that business intact so that Enron would retain some of the benefits of that business,'' she said. 
Part of that effort included payments of millions of dollars to keep crucial employees, including some natural gas and electricity traders, both before the collapse of Enron's merger with Dynegy and soon before the company sought bankruptcy protection. Those payments, which were criticized by creditors at the time, may have bolstered the value of the trading business. 
''Forget about having all these physical assets,'' said Peter Rigby, director of utilities, energy and project finance for Standard & Poor's. ''It's a very knowledge-dependent business.'' 
An energy trading business at its simplest sells energy commodities, like gas or electricity, at a specific time, Mr. Rigby said. But the business becomes more complicated for a market maker like Enron, which matches buyers and sellers of commodities, as well as hedging products that allow companies, utilities or other entities to protect themselves from fluctuations in the prices of energy products. Some traders might watch the weather in different parts of the country to anticipate energy needs, for example. 
Where the experience becomes valuable, though, Mr. Rigby said, is in understanding more of the complexities of energy markets -- the times of peak use in different markets in different time zones, the location and capacity of power plants in different regions and potential matches of buyers and sellers. 
''You've got to know about markets; you've got to know about the weather; you've got to know about power markets and fuel markets,'' he said. 
But determining how much that experience is worth is another question -- complicated, Enron's lawyers say, by the fact that bids are taking the form of ownership stakes in a joint venture that would also operate the trading business. Potential buyers propose the percentage of the joint venture they would own, the lawyer said; the advantage to the trading business is the financial credibility that it would have as a result of financial backing from outside Enron. 
A committee of Enron's creditors and company executives will meet with bidders this week to try to improve the offers that have been made. A winning bid could be approved as early as Friday by the bankruptcy court.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron gets bids for trading operations.

01/08/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Two banks have submitted bids for a controlling stake in Enron Corp.'s dormant energy trading business, moves that may allow the once-dominant business to revive in coming weeks, people familiar with the company's plans said Tuesday. 
Enron, which declared bankruptcy on Dec. 2, received bids from Citicorp Inc. and UBS Warburg for a majority stake in the Houston-based energy trading operations. But a third financial institution that previously expressed interest, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. declined to submit a bid by last night, the deadline for bids for the Enron assets, these people said.
Citicorp, UBS Warburg and J.P. Morgan declined to comment on any interest in Enron assets. 
Analysts said its difficult to value the once-powerful trading operation that has virtually shut down, hobbled by worries over Enron's murky finances. The assets being auctioned make up the bulk of Enron's wholesale services business, which generated $94.9 billion in 2000, with $2.2 billion in revenue. 
John Olson, an analyst with Houston-based Sanders Morris Harris, estimated the trading business stake could go for $1 billion to $1.5 billion, since ""this thing is going to have to crawl before it can walk."" 
However, Robert Chambers, analyst with Lehman Brothers, said he anticipated bids of no more than $100 million, since he said Enron is basically auctioning off only ""people, computers and software, but not the book,"" referring to contracts that Enron had forged before its bankruptcy. 
""Chances of getting a $2 billion auction bid are impossible, given that they are not selling the book,"" said Chambers. He acknowledged being ""bearish"" on Enron, but said there is still Enron, particularly its distressed bonds, which he values at 35 cents on the dollar, even though they are trading at 24 cents. 
Another analyst, who asked to remain unnamed, said the operation could command a value of 10 times earnings, or about $10 billion, and any valuation depends on ""a big caveat of whether this trading operation will come back."" 
In addition to the banks, British oil giant BP Plc also said it may be interested in the Enron operations, once the world's biggest trader of contracts for natural gas and other energy commodities. 
BP said it had submitted a bid of $25 million for a small portion of Enron's assets, including some back office functions and information technology assets. A spokesperson for the London-based company it said it may be interested in other assets but declined to elaborate. 
Enron has all but shut down its Houston-based trading operations while it seeks a financial backer that could guarantee contracts for the myriad commodities that it has traded. Enron trading operations generated the bulk of its $101 billion in revenue in 2000. 
Previously, Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and UBS Warburg had expressed interest in this role, according to people familiar with the company's plans. 
The company is slated to decide on Thursday whether to accept a bid. Enron lawyers previously stated that the company is not looking for cash bids, but rather an ownership stake of up to 51 percent. The stake would give the bidder cash flow from the operations, but it would agree to guarantee contracts. 
Any bid for the trading operations must be approved by Judge Arthur Gonzalez of the Southern District of New York bankruptcy court, which is overseeing Enron's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. 
Enron is offloading the trading operations to generate cash to pay off as much as $40 billion in debt. 
Enron collapsed after disclosures of hidden debt in off-balance sheet transactions destroyed investor confidence in the Houston-based company. Enron's advisors have made it a priority to revive the trading operations, which have all but stalled in the wake of the bankruptcy filing.

Enron favours Sempra Energy to buy its metals trading group - sources

LONDON (AFX) - Enron Corp favours the San Diego-based Sempra Energy as an acquirer of its metals trading arm over other interested parties Glencore, the Swiss commodities trader, HSBC, and Goldman Sachs, sources told AFX News. 
""Enron considers Sempra to be the best bidder because it wants the business and the people while other parties just want the positions,"" the source said.
""The preference of Enron's bankruptcy committee is to find a buyer who is willing to take the people as well as the positions,"" the source said. 
In this way, Enron would also avoid employee severance costs, he said. 
Sempra director of media relations David Klein said the company is interested in certain assets of Enron, ""which would be complementary to our business."" 
However, those interests have not been identified to the public, Klein said. 
Yesterday, Enron company sources told AFX News that Enron has already agreed to sell its metals trading arm to Sempra. 
Klein would not comment on the report in line with company policy regarding market rumours. 
Enron was expected to formally announce the winning suitor of its metal business before Christmas, but a decision was delayed because of difficulties in unravelling the group's complex corporate structure, according to a Financial Times report last week. 
However, the deal was completed as early as before Christmas and details are now being formalised, Enron sources said. 
The London-based business would also include operations in the US, the source said. 
Enron could not be contacted at the time of reporting. 
Shares of Enron closed the trading day up 5 cents to 73 cents, while Sempra rose 15 cents to 25.14 usd.

Philippine Min Expects Enron Pwr Pacts Buyout By End-Jan

01/09/2002
Dow Jones Asian Equities Report
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

MANILA -(Dow Jones)- Philippine Energy Secretary Vincent Perez said Wednesday he expects the government to reach a deal by the end of January to buy out power contracts of financially-troubled Enron Corp. (ENE). 
Perez told reporters that the Power Sector Assets & Liabilities Management Corp., or Psalm, appears to have secured a large discount for the contracts.
Psalm was created to assume the debts and assets of National Power Corp. (Q.NAP), or Napocor, prior to its privatization. 
""For Psalm to sign an agreement with Enron, a higher discount rate must be offered and it looks like it's going to happen,"" Perez said. 
Enron initially offered a 12% discount on future cash flow from its power supply contracts with Napocor, but Psalm wanted a discount rate that is in the ""high teens."" 
""Psalm and Enron are still in discussions. We expect something by the end of the month,"" Perez said. 
Enron's operations in the Philippines include two oil-fired plants - the 110-megawatt Batangas plant and the 116-MW plant in Subic Bay - which the company runs under build-operate-transfer contracts with Napocor. 
Under the terms of its power contracts with Napocor for the Batangas and Subic Bay power plants, if one party seeks to pull out of the contract ahead of the expiry date, both parties will negotiate the cost of exiting the contract prematurely.

Unresolved Problem: Interview With Terry Keenan
Bill O'Reilly, Terry Keenan

01/08/2002
Fox News: The O'Reilly Factor
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.

O'REILLY: In the ""Unresolved Problem"" segment tonight, who's at fault for the Enron debacle? I say the Justice Department must investigate Enron executives who made millions while mismanaging the company into bankruptcy, and the little guy got hosed. 
But Fox News financial reporter Terry Keenan believes individual stockholders are at fault, as well. Terry, who hosts the weekend business program ""CASHING IN,"" joins us now.
This is personal to me, because I had Enron stock. And the reason I bought it was because I buy a tout sheet by a guy named McIntyre up in Massachusetts, pretty good reputation, guys have a (inaudible) track record. He's telling me Enron's a good buy. I buy it. And how am I supposed to know what these criminals are doing behind the scenes at this company? 
TERRY KEENAN, FOX NEWS SENIOR BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, if there was fraud involved, and there probably was, that still doesn't negate the fact that this stock was extremely overvalued. There wasn't a lot of good reporting on it. A lot of people didn't even know what the company did. 
And the first rule of investing is, don't buy things that you don't know about, and certainly don't... 
O'REILLY: Well, I knew about it... 
(CROSSTALK) 
KEENAN: ... (inaudible)... 
O'REILLY: ... and I looked at the chart, and this time last year, all the big brokerage houses -- Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber -- all of these people had buys. 
KEENAN: And you probably looked at the chart, and the stock was trading at $80 or $90, and like a lot of people... 
O'REILLY: Well, it had a big P/E. 
KEENAN: ... (inaudible) -- wow, this is, this is a great company. 
O'REILLY: OK. But it was in a good industry, and McIntyre is telling me it's a good stock, all the brokerage houses are saying it's good, all the CNBC people are saying, Hey, it's great. So how do I know? 
KEENAN: Well, the second rule of investing is, don't listen to those Wall Street analysts, because they're paid to tout stocks. And what they're... 
O'REILLY: All right, well, wait a minute... 
KEENAN: ... (inaudible)... 
O'REILLY: ... who am I supposed to... 
KEENAN: ... to do. 
O'REILLY: ... listen to? I can't get the records from this Enron company, I can't see... 
KEENAN: Oh, you can, the SEC, they're filed public records every quarter. 
O'REILLY: Who do I go to, down to Washington and look up Enron? 
KEENAN: No, you go -- there's a Web site, FreeEdgar, doesn't even cost you a cent. You can go on there, you can see -- all the records are probably what you would find, because there were a lot of footnotes and a lot of unexplained questions in this company... 
O'REILLY: To where? You're telling me... 
KEENAN: ... and it was, like I said... 
O'REILLY: ... as an investor, I should go to the SEC Web site and look up Enron. 
KEENAN: The other thing is... 
O'REILLY: And what am I going to find there? 
KEENAN: You're going to find all of their public documents. And you're going to find a lot of footnotes that are going to raise a lot of questions about why this stock was trading at 50 times earnings when its counterparts... 
O'REILLY: Did you know that stock was... 
KEENAN: ... are trading at 50. 
O'REILLY: ... was going to tank? Did you know? 
KEENAN: I didn't buy it. I certainly had a lot of questions. But I didn't understand it. They were trading something called broadband. I didn't know what that was, and I didn't know why the stock... 
O'REILLY: Well, I know what broadband is. 
KEENAN: I didn't know why -- I didn't know trading broadband was. 
O'REILLY: All right. Well, here's the deal. Most people, they're not sophisticated enough, including me, to go to the Web site and figure out what the footnotes are. I don't know. I'm trusting certain people to give me financial advice. Obviously, the people who did that are not on my A-list right now. But you've got guys in that company who made millions of dollars as this stock came down, OK? And I saw public announcements. These guys came out in public and said, ""Our stock's fine. Our company's great. There's no problem here."" They ought to be arrested! 
KEENAN: And probably ought to disgorge all of those profits... 
O'REILLY: That's right! 
KEENAN: ... from selling the stock. 
O'REILLY: Absolutely. 
KEENAN: But as a small investor, you could go on Yahoo, put in the name Enron, and this is what you would have found in the summertime. This is the insider selling. 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: But Terry, look. 
KEENAN: ... those -- those executives selling the stock. 
O'REILLY: Look at this. How many people have time to do this? See? I mean, a lot of people had Enron and their 401(k)s. Their advisers bought it for them. I mean, come on! 
KEENAN: Well, if I had 100 percent of my net worth in Enron stock, I would have been looking to see if my bosses were selling. 
O'REILLY: Fine. Granted. But even when you have insider selling, the only way I know about to get it is from ""Barron's,"" and they list it, like, four or five weeks after it's sold. 
KEENAN: Yeah, but they started selling in 2000. They sold 6 million shares, these executives, in the year 2000. 
O'REILLY: All right. 
KEENAN: Only two million last year. So they got out right at the top. 
O'REILLY: All right. So they got out right at the top. These guys inside, they started selling. But they told the public and all they told all the analysts there's nothing wrong with the stock. It's going continue to do well. So they lied. So they lied. So what should happen to them? 
KEENAN: They should go to jail. If they lied and if they committed fraud, which it perhaps looks like they did, it's not 100 percent sure... 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: Well, let's have an investigation, right? 
KEENAN: Yeah. There's eight federal investigations right now. 
O'REILLY: Well, there aren't really investigations. There are congressional hearings. John Ashcroft hasn't assigned the FBI, as we talked about earlier, to investigate the Enron guys. 
KEENAN: No, he hasn't. And hopefully, he will. But you know, $4 trillion in market value has been lost in the stock market over the last year and half. More money was lost in Cisco in 2001 than in Enron. Are we going to have a federal investigations... 
O'REILLY: Yes! 
KEENAN: ... into every one of these stocks? 
O'REILLY: If there's insider selling. If these CEOs are lying and they're selling and saying everything's great, yes. That's fraud in the inducement. That's against the law! 
KEENAN: Well, it's going to keep a lot of people very busy. The public... 
O'REILLY: Well, good. Let's clean this up! 
KEENAN: The public pronouncements are wrong. You can't tout the stock while you're selling, but it's legal for them to sell their stock... 
O'REILLY: And I think... 
KEENAN: ... and disclose it, as they did. 
O'REILLY: And I think all of these -- all of these, you know, spinmeisters that go on your show and Cavuto's show and everything -- I should -- you should give them their home addresses when they do this kind of stuff! 
KEENAN: Yeah, but let me tell you, I've had a lot of negative analysts on who've said negative things. 
O'REILLY: All right. 
KEENAN: Some of them have gotten death threats. 
O'REILLY: I got it. I got it. 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: You know what I'm talking about, though. A lot of these pinheads don't know what they're talking about. Terry Keenan, thanks very much. 
We'll be right back.

Recession-Proof? Hot Texas Deal Climate Could Chill
BY LAURA MANDARO

01/09/2002
American Banker

Copyright (c) 2002 Thomson Financial, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Texas has been having its share of woes -- Enron Corp.'s failure, oil prices declining, and technology companies and airlines in distress -- none of it good news for the banking industry. But opinions differ on how severe the impact on Texas' economy will be. 
Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn, for example, says Texas may avoid the recession altogether thanks to its industrial diversity.
And his colleague Chip Carlisle, the regional president of Wells' metropolitan markets in Texas, said, ""Our loan demand has remained really strong. I wouldn't say that some of the things you see on a national scale you're seeing here."" 
There are concrete signs, however, that the once-thriving Texas economy has begun to slow, and some observers say it will suffer the worst of the credit problems and rebound later than the rest of the nation. 
Unemployment in the state, which has a population of more than 20 million, jumped from 3.8% last January to 5.4% in November. The national figure rose from 4.2% to 5.6% in the same period. 
Diane C. Swonk, the chief economist for Bank One Corp., said that when Texas recovers ""it won't be the boom state it was in the late 1990s."" 
She predicts that the nation will come out of the recession in the first quarter, growing at a 0.6% rate. She expects the economies of Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma -- three states tracked by Bank One in its Oil Patch index, where Texas is the dominant economy -- to shrink at an 0.8% rate, and not to emerge from recession until the second quarter. 
However, the recession in Texas ""will be more muted, and bouncing out of it will also be more muted"" than at the national level, Ms. Swonk said. 
Muted or not, the slowdown is making at least one bank consider putting the brakes on its ambitions in Texas. 
Zions Bancorp of Salt Lake City, a seasoned acquirer of community banks in the West, has long had its sights on entering the Texas market. At an investors conference in December, chief executive Harris H. Simmons pointed out that Zions has branches in five of the top 10 growth markets in the country but is not in the second- and third-fastest-expanding markets: Dallas and San Antonio. 
""I could see us getting into Texas with the right kind of deal,"" Mr. Simmons said. But, he added, with signs of a slowdown there ""we're in no rush."" Reached Tuesday, he said that he did not wish to add anything to that statement. 
Increased caution on the part of out-of-state buyers would be big news for independent Texas banks. Of 741 banks and thrifts in the state, 714 have less than $1 billion of assets. And out-of-state banks have been eager to purchase community banks, particularly in the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth markets. 
In mid-December, for example, Wells Fargo announced plans to buy Tejas Bancshares in Amarillo for $82.5 million. Regions Financial Corp. in Birmingham, Ala., and BOK Financial Corp. in Tulsa, Okla., have bought several small banks, and Bank of Montreal has also expressed interest in Texas. 
Though many of the acquisitions cost less than $1 billion, the deals eventually add up. The percentage of Texas deposits controlled by out-of-state banks leapt from 19.3% on June 30, 2000 to 41.9% by the end of last June. 
Texas is not an insignificant market for larger banking companies either. 
Bank One gets 14% of its deposits from the state, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. gets 14% and Hibernia National Bank 13%, according to research from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Wells Fargo's Mr. Carlisle said that the one significant change he has seen among commercial borrowers is an increased interest in restructuring their debt to take advantage of lower interest rates. ""We're seeing a lot of requests -- certainly something we have to be prepared to do."" 
But even a delayed slowdown could deter more banks from pursuing deals in Texas. 
Acquisitions aside, observers say the slowing economy will probably hurt loan volume and credit quality, particularly among small-business and middle-market commercial borrowers. 
Already, larger national banks such as Morgan Chase, FleetBoston Financial Corp., and Bank of New York Co. have said that they expect to take charges for this quarter because of exposure to Houston-based Enron. But it is the future influence of Enron's failure, the pending sale of Compaq Corp., and low profits at Texas-based airlines such as Continental that will hurt loan volume and credit. 
Texas is likely to experience a ""more pronounced erosion in commercial middle-market relating to a more-rapid-than-expected slowdown in the economy,"" said Credit Suisse First Boston bank analyst Rosalind Looby. 
""I don't think we're looking at a meltdown, but this is going to cease to be the real bright spot that it was,"" she said.

FORTUNE Advisor/Investing; Against The Grain
Caught Off Balance Bond sleuths were ahead on Enron. Now they have their sights on three others.
Herb Greenberg

01/21/2002
Fortune Magazine
Time Inc.
116
(Copyright 2002)

If you learn nothing else from the Enron mess, take this lesson to heart: A company's inability to handle its debt can be its downfall-- no matter how much Wall Street likes its stock. Indeed, while earnings may be a window to a company's psyche, the balance sheet is what gives you a truer picture of its well-being. Bond analysts make a beeline to this crucial piece of financial disclosure, paying special attention to a company's ability to service its debt. And when the ratio of cash to debt plunges--watch out! 
The best balance-sheet snoops are often way ahead of the pack in finding signs of trouble. Sometimes, however, the big credit-rating firms, Standard & Poor's and Moody's, which get paid by the companies they rate, are slow off the mark--slower, as a rule, than independent bond-rating services like Egan-Jones of Wynnewood, Pa., or research firms like New York-based Gimme Credit. ""We don't have the constraint of trying to keep a company happy,"" says Egan-Jones President Sean Egan, whose downgrade of Enron to junk beat the big guys by about a month. (To be fair, Moody's is revising how it assesses companies, taking into account additional information that could lead to a default. Standard & Poor's, for its part, argues that its existing methods are adequate.)
Given the scope--and the surprise--of the Enron failure, it's worth asking: Are there other companies out there that these aggressive independent credit-rating agencies are flagging now? You can bet on it. We're not necessarily talking future Enrons, but simply companies whose financial situation is more dire than the market thinks. Certainly one where the alarm bells are ringing loudly (and which--don't remind me--got a positive nod from this column a year ago) is Ford Motor. It's no secret that Ford is having serious problems, but you wouldn't know it from its credit rating, which is still investment grade. Egan-Jones, however, labels it BBB-, a few notches lower than the other rating agencies do and just one step above junk. That's where Egan-Jones thinks Ford will arrive within six months, as the sales boost from the much heralded 0% financing starts to wane and bad auto loans pile up. Junk status raises the cost of borrowing and would be particularly damaging for Ford, whose ability to cover its debt has been deteriorating rapidly. Egan and other bond analysts measure this by calculating a company's interest coverage ratio--pretax income plus interest expense divided by interest expense. 
The ratio, which varies widely by industry, is key to credit analysis. Egan calculates that Ford's interest coverage has tumbled from 2.2 in September 2000 to just above 1 now. ""That's akin to saying that nearly everything you earn will have to be used to pay your interest expense, which doesn't leave a lot of money to invest in the business,"" he says. Ford responds that it's ""disappointed"" by the Egan-Jones rating; both S&P and Moody's insist they haven't been laggards and that their ratings are appropriate. 
Egan-Jones is even warier of computer maker Hewlett-Packard. Its credit picture is as imperiled as its proposed Compaq merger, according to Egan-Jones--which has already tossed the tech giant's debt on the junk heap with a rating of BB+, several notches below that of the major rating agencies. ""It's appropriate to view Hewlett- Packard on a stand-alone basis, which is not particularly attractive,"" Egan says. ""Today it is hard to name any business where it's the undisputed leader--even its printer business is being attacked."" Making matters worse: From October 2000, Hewlett- Packard's interest coverage has sunk steadily from 19 to just 6.6. (By contrast, IBM's ratio, according to Egan-Jones, is 11.7.) Hewlett- Packard officials couldn't be reached for comment. 
Finally, there's retailer Gap (another company this column once argued you should never bet against, because of its miracle-working marketing genius of a CEO, Mickey Drexler). While Gimme Credit's Carol Levenson says Gap's balance-sheet condition is not yet critical, it's ""not nearly as strong as it used to be."" Egan-Jones points out that Gap's interest coverage ratio has plunged from 27.3 down to 8.8 over the past four quarters. As a result, the firm rates the retailer's debt one step above junk and a couple of notches below that of both Standard & Poor's and Moody's ratings. Gap officials say they have never ""worked"" with Egan-Jones and point to the retailer's standing with the major rating agencies instead. The problem is, as Enron proved, those agencies are not always the first to sound the alarm.

Natural Gas Futures Slip Lower 
 
    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX wandered lower  yesterday in uninspired trading as the market consolidated following Wednesday's  surprising high storage injection. Much of the trading was conducted by local  and short-term traders willing to trade for small gains, compromising price  discovery. El Paso and Enron were trying to coax the market up so they could  initiate sales. Traders anticipate todays activity to be similar to yesterdays  lackluster pace. The July contract fell $0.011 to $3.79 per MMBtu and August  also dipped $0.011 to $3.877 per MMBtu. On Wednesday the AGA reported storage  levels at 1,398 Bcf, virtually identical to the 5-year average, and 46 Bcf more  than a year ago. After several days of cool, rainy weather, much of the eastern  half of the nation will have more summer-like weather this weekend and early  next weeks. Demand use will increase significantly, but will not be unusually  high for early June. Hot weather in the southwestern states will begin to move  into Texas and the Plains this weekend. Look for the market to continue to slip  lower in the absence of any significant driving force. There needs to be  something to change the dynamics of the market, but in the meantime, most  everybody is on the same page, and the locals are simply trying to pick each  other's pockets. The next key level of technical support is $3.60, with $4.00  and $4.20 offering resistance. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US  dropped $0.05 - $0.15 per MMBtu, except out west where prices continued to  tumble. Canadian spot prices rebounded from yesterdays sharp decline. Natural  gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.07 to $3.69 per  MMBtu.

DOE Seeks Input on Research Programs
 
    The DOE plans a series of town hall-style meetings next  week across the nation to hear from the public, elected officials and energy  experts on federal research programs that promote energy efficiency and more use  of renewable fuels. The input at these meetings will help the DOE identify  opportunities for future research and investment while assessing our past  effectiveness. The meetings are part of a comprehensive review of the  department's multibillion dollar research programs as called for in the Bush  administration's new national energy plan. Environmental and consumers groups  have opposed the administration's proposed budget cuts in the research programs.  The first two public meetings will take place on June 12th in Atlanta and  Chicago, followed by June 19th meetings in Boston and Seattle, June 21st in  Denver and Philadelphia and a June 26th meeting in Washington. Each meeting will  last from 9 AM to 9 PM local time.

Senate Democrats to Investigate High Energy Prices
 
    The new Democratic chairman of the  Senate  Governmental Affairs Committee says he will examine FERCs refusal to cap  wholesale power prices in western states. Following the recent shift in control  of the Senate to Democrats, Senator Lieberman of Connecticut has charged that  the FERC has failed to do its job, and will hold a June 20th hearing on the  matter. President Bush and FERC chairman Hebert are against electricity price  caps, arguing they would discourage firms from building new power plants and do  nothing to encourage conservation. California represents 15% of the economy and  any major downturn there would have rippling effects across the nation,  Lieberman warned. He will also hold a June 13th hearing on the impact of  deregulation of the electricity and natural gas industries. A subcommittee of  the governmental affairs panel is planning a separate investigation into the oil  industry's record profits and high retail gasoline prices.

Canadian Producers Investigate Coal Gas
 
    Canadian producers are counting on obtaining big natural  gas volumes from shallow coal seams. Alberta Energy, Nexen, PanCanadian  Petroleum and Penn West Petroleum are spending millions of dollars to  investigate whether natural gas trapped in coal beds less than 3,300 feet deep  can be produced economically.  The US derives 7% of its natural gas  production from coal seam gas. Western Canada is estimated to have between 135  Tcf and 260 Tcf of recoverable coal gas. Natural gas fields containing at least  17 Tcf have been discovered in Canada's Far North, but bringing them to market  will cost billions to build new pipelines and other facilities. Advocates say  many coal deposits sit near existing processing plants and transmission lines,  meaning coal gas fields will be cheaper to connect and produce than Arctic  reserves. The Alberta Research Council has spent several years researching ways  to enhance coal gas production and is looking for C$12 million to proceed with a  pilot project.

El Paso Market Power Abuse Investigation Continues
 
    FERC's investigation into alleged market power abuse by  El Paso is still proceeding a month after it began. Both El Paso and the  California PUC have painted contradicting versions of events, and the hearing  looks no closer to conclusion than when it began. El Paso is attempting to  discredit a study prepared by The Brattle Group, a Massachusetts consultant  hired by Edison to find evidence that El Paso Merchant wielded market power. It  dutifully concluded that soaring California prices were not caused by regular  market forces and pointed to a conspiracy to widen border-basin price spreads.  As part of El Paso's effort to tarnish the study, a professor of political  economy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government testified that Brattle's tale  doesnt add up. In order to prove market power, he said 3 conditions must be met:  * The system for getting gas to California must not be full; * El Paso Merchant  must have unutilized, but available, delivery rights; and * Other shippers must  have fully utilized their delivery rights. The final condition, he says proves  that market power is impossible to establish.

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Options Report
Premiums Stay High on Enron's Near Options, And `Doubling Up' Date Looms for Tax Losses

NEW YORK -- Volatility and premiums on Enron's near-month options remain extremely high. It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price for option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston company sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled investors. 
Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet session Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Enron's calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate income. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a three-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dynegy Inc. Enron's December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compared with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE. 
For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the ""wash sale"" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring ""substantially identical"" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose prices now make them attractive ""buy"" candidates. 
In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the wash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money put, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquired by the investor. 
So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by ""doubling up"": buying additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, which locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying additional stock.

Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits Crossroads
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multibillion-dollar deal. 
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading company, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $2 billion in loans by the end of the year. 
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharply lower, market observers said. 
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dynegy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each. 
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said his company was working ""to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement"" though it continued to perform ""due diligence"" on Enron. 
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe enough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier this year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to complete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit. 
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal, two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders would have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set. 
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enron contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It couldn't be determined what the new information was. 
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to Dynegy. 
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price. 
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. Initially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officials have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year, would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings. 
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial problems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a ""likely scenario"" is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15 Dynegy share for each Enron share. 
Such a ratcheting down wouldn't be without precedent in the deal. According to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the exchange formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of Enron's rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was above $80 a share. 
In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts that the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could ""recover the significant business that has been lost"" in its giant energy-trading operations. ""The Enron machine continues to sputter,"" Mr. Fleischer wrote. 
Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to renegotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-law filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing ""is highly possible,"" said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one notch above noninvestment-grade, or ""junk,"" status. But Fitch also said it believed Enron's trading partners had made ""significant cash collateral calls"" in recent days that are ""well in excess of previous expectations,"" contributing to ""liquidity pressures."" 
Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spokeswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefore doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the merger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alternatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron said it made some progress improving its financial position. The company said it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion in secured credit lines. Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repayment of an existing $690 million note to mid-December from next week. The spokeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be completed next month so that repayment wouldn't be required this year.

Enron Faces Suits by 401(k) Plan Participants
By Theo Francis and Ellen Schultz
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, has been sued by members of its employee-retirement plan, which has suffered losses because of Enron's plummeting stock price. 
Two separate lawsuits, filed in federal court in Houston, allege Enron misled participants in its 401(k) retirement plan about the risks of investing in the company's shares and note that the company forced the employees to remain invested in its stock even as the shares fell. Amid growing disclosures of financial problems in recent weeks, the company ""locked down"" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed.
Enron, which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., Houston, because of mounting financial problems, has seen its stock price fall to $5.01 on Wednesday from a peak of nearly $90 a share last year. The decline has been costly to participants in Enron's retirement plan because more than 60% of the 401(k) assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year, according to one of the suits. 
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP, a Houston law firm, and the second was filed Tuesday by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. Both seek class-action certification. 
Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits. A spokeswoman also said the company's 401(k) plan offers participants 18 investment choices, one of which is company stock. 
The company's stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed by former company officials. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a formal investigation into the company's accounting, and Enron has said it will restate years of financial information. 
The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against companies over losses in the company-stock portion of their 401(k) plans. The suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continuing to offer company stock, even after they became aware of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. All the suits are pending. 
As with most of these companies, Enron matches employee contributions to the 401(k) with shares of Enron stock, and also offers Enron stock as an investment choice, in addition to a variety of mutual funds. About $1.3 billion of the plan's $2.1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the end of 2000, according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison. 
Pamela Tittle, a participant in the 401(k) plan who worked in the finance department and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harrison & Wright, had roughly 2,000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement account and has suffered losses of about $140,000 as a result of the stock's decline. The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron 401(k) plan violated their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company stock was in peril. 
The suit filed by Hagens Berman, also alleges that the company failed to warn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock. In addition, it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial results since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the SEC. 
Roy E. Rinard, a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in the suit filed by Hagens Berman, has seen the value of his retirement plan fall to $70,000 from $470,000, largely as a result of the decline in Enron's stock. ""I feel like I have been betrayed,"" Mr. Rinard said in press release issued by his lawyers. ""I lost my savings, my plans for the future, everything."" 
Under federal pension law, companies are allowed to offer their own stock in retirement plans, and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the stock. Enron doesn't let employees diversify out of shares they receive as matching contributions to the 401(k) plan until age 50. 
However, plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interests of the participants, which includes choosing prudent investments. Generally, to prove that the plan's administrators breached their fiduciary duties, employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investment. This presents a high hurdle, so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits over losses in company stock in 401(k) plans have generally come in the wake of allegations of accounting irregularities. 
Lynn Sarko, one of Ms. Tittle's attorneys with Seattle's Keller Rohrback LLP, is also co-lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies Inc., Murray Hill, N.J. Another firm representing Ms. Tittle is Dalton Gotto Samson & Kilgard PLC, which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ikon Office Solutions Inc., Malvern, Pa. The two law firms are representing Ms. Tittle with Campbell Harrison & Wright. 
The suits against Lucent and Ikon, like the suit against Enron, allege that then-current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. Representatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn't require employees to invest in the company stock, and educated employees about the need for diversification. 
The suit in which Mr. Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct. 17, a day after Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $1.01 billion in the third quarter, Enron ""locked down"" the 401(k) plan's assets, preventing participants from selling Enron shares. (A ""lock-down"" occurs when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another, and generally lasts several weeks, during which time participants can't make changes in their investment choices). 
The lock-down was lifted on Nov. 19. In the interim, on Nov. 8, Enron announced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results from 1997 through 2000. By the time the lock-down was lifted, as a result of all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $9 a share from $32.20 on Oct. 17, when the lockup started, Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth said. 
""They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announcing some really bad news,"" Mr. Barth said. ""Mr. Rinard's looking at having no retirement savings now. It's a horrible thing to have to start over in your 50s.""

From Sunbeam to Enron, Andersen's Reputation Suffers
By FLOYD NORRIS

THIS has been the worst year ever for Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen partner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Management case. 
Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Arthur Andersen, in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from the company's reported profits in recent years.
All of which raises the question: Has Arthur Andersen become the black sheep of the accounting industry? 
It is not an easy question to answer, and not everyone is willing to rush to judgment. ''If you want to attack Andersen for Enron, you need to know more than we know,'' Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said this week. 
But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases, it is materiality. In all three cases, Andersen auditors spotted bad accounting but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahead. 
Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into trouble. The idea is that it doesn't much matter if a few little things were gotten wrong. But they can add up. 
At Enron, however, they did not add up to that much -- a total of $93 million over four years. The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a related party that Enron now says should have been consolidated. It is not clear if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time. 
To those who treasure the role of auditors, the humiliation of Andersen is painful. Back in the 1950's, it was Leonard Spacek, Andersen's managing partner, who warned that ''the profession's existence is in peril'' because it was not showing enough independence. His public prodding was crucial in making the industry do a better job. Two decades ago, when the issue on the table was pension accounting, Andersen was the only major accounting firm to break with clients and push for good rules. 
Now Andersen's backbone is open to question. It was evidence that senior people at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that led the S.E.C. to bring that suit, which the firm chose to settle without admitting it had done anything wrong. The partner that the S.E.C. says looked the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations, and Andersen says he acted properly. 
Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant of the S.E.C. at the time and is now director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University, says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what happened to Coopers & Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a series of highly publicized blown audits. 
''We got bludgeoned to death in the press,'' he said. ''People did not even want to see us at their doorsteps. It was brutal, but we deserved it. We had gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls.'' By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending clients and not enough to good accounting. 
For Andersen to avoid that fate, its relatively new chief executive, Joseph Berardino, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will need to set a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the backbone that Mr. Spacek epitomized. And then he will have to convince the public of that.

Chase and J. P. Morgan's Paper Anniversary
A Year After the Merger, Rosy Plans Meet Reality
By RIVA D. ATLAS

11/23/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

When William B. Harrison Jr. speaks of last year's $31 billion merger of J. P. Morgan and the Chase Manhattan Corporation, he speaks proudly of a deal that he considers to be a capstone to his 34-year career of helping build a giant of the banking business. 
''This is the first merger I've been part of,'' said Mr. Harrison, the chief executive of the combined bank, ''where I feel our core business is complete.''
The Chase-J. P. Morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investment banking elite, just as Mr. Harrison intended. But with Wall Street and the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was put together, the many mergers, stock sales and other money-making opportunities that were supposed to justify the high-priced acquisition have largely dried up for now. 
Consequently, deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already speculating that Mr. Harrison, 58, may ultimately be compelled to do yet another large deal, this time to diversify his business away from its heavy emphasis on Wall Street. 
J. P. Morgan Chase has won some prominent assignments, like handling the revampings of troubled giants like Lucent and, more recently, Enron, the beleaguered energy trading company. 
But while J. P. Morgan Chase is proud of serving alongside Citigroup as both lead lender and adviser to Enron on its acquisition by Dynegy, the dual role it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank. With Enron's shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidden debts, J. P. Morgan Chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with Dynegy on track. 
Thanks largely to the slump on Wall Street, J. P. Morgan Chase's profits fell by two-thirds in the third quarter, to $449 million from $1.4 billion in the period a year ago. Its stock has dropped 15 percent this year, more than other banks' shares. The bank's stock is ahead of investment banks like Goldman Sachs, with which J. P. Morgan Chase increasingly competes. 
''The jury is still out in many respects on this merger,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Nevertheless, he likes J. P. Morgan Chase's stock, he said, because ''expectations are very low.'' 
All J. P. Morgan Chase's competitors are suffering from the slowdown on Wall Street. But some, like Citigroup, are better diversified and have greater involvement in old-fashioned consumer banking, which is proving to be a strong moneymaker this year. 
Nearly a third of J. P. Morgan Chase's revenues are consumer-oriented. By contrast, its chief New York rival, Citigroup, gets half its revenues from consumer businesses. 
''The timing of the merger was bad,'' said Steven Wharton, a banking analyst at Loomis, Sayles & Company, which owns about a million J. P. Morgan Chase shares. ''There's no disputing that.'' 
Actually, Mr. Harrison disputes it. ''I can't tell you how happy I am about having done this merger,'' he said in a recent interview. ''While there are pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment, we have a much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time.'' 
In Mr. Harrison's favor is his battle-tested team of top executives who have worked together for a decade or more. Few executives remain in the top spots from the old J. P. Morgan. Instead, most major posts are filled by managers who have worked with Mr. Harrison since his days at Chemical Bank, where he spent most of his career. Mr. Harrison's team successfully gobbled up Manufacturers Hanover Bank in 1991, then followed that with Chemical's merger with Chase Manhattan in 1996 before incorporating Morgan into the fold last year. 
The group of Chemical veterans includes Marc J. Shapiro, who oversees finance and risk management at J. P. Morgan Chase; Donald H. Layton, one of two leaders of investment banking; and James B. Lee Jr., the bank's senior deal maker. The team also includes Dina Dublon, the bank's chief financial officer. 
Two other senior executives have also lived through big deals. Geoffrey T. Boisi, the other investment banking leader, was the one-time investment banking chief at Goldman, Sachs. David A. Coulter, in charge of Chase's retail bank, had been chief executive of Bank of America before it was bought by NationsBank. 
''There aren't many teams that have gone through as many mergers as Bill Harrison and his team,'' said Mark G. Solow, managing principal at GarMark Advisors, an investment firm, and a former senior executive at Chemical. 
Still, Ms. Dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the J. P. Morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations. 
''In general, mergers are very hard on morale,'' she said. ''There is no question that this one has a tougher emotional toll.'' 
The bank's executives are making the best of a bad situation. They have taken advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks' staff, or about 2,500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merger was announced. 
Many of these job cuts were aimed at high-cost investment bankers: J. P. Morgan Chase expects that 6,000 jobs in its investment banking division will have been eliminated by the end of the year. 
''We have focused on the tougher jobs to cut,'' Ms. Dublon said. 
In some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for J. P. Morgan Chase to overhaul its staff. With fewer jobs available on Wall Street, Mr. Shapiro said, the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain about changes in their jobs. ''People have fewer options,'' he said, ''so you have a little more control over the process.'' 
Thanks partly to these cuts, the bank estimates the saving from cost cutting will be $3.6 billion annually, compared with an original projection of $2 billion at the time of the merger. 
The cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits in the bank's core businesses. ''What we can control and are managing very aggressively is the expenses of the company,'' Ms. Dublon said in a conference call with reporters on Oct. 17, the day earnings were announced. 
Aside from cost cuts, the weakness on Wall Street makes it hard for the bank's executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking, where fees were down 24 percent in the third quarter. But Mr. Harrison points to market-share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on Wall Street. He hopes that when the investment banking business revives, J. P. Morgan Chase will hold on to these gains. 
The bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas: mergers and acquisitions, and the underwriting of large investment-grade bond deals. 
The bank ranked 5th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising on mergers during the first nine months of 2001, up from Chase's 12th-place finish and J. P. Morgan's 10th-place standing during the same period last year, according to Thomson Financial Securities data. 
The merger and acquisitions business, which Chase had been slowly building for years, is stronger following the merger with J. P. Morgan, said Mr. Lee, a vice chairman at the bank. As a result, the bank is able to win assignments providing advice to customers who dealt with the old Chase only for loans. 
Mr. Lee remains proud of the bank's work with Enron, the energy company, despite its troubles. J. P. Morgan Chase, along with Citigroup, raised $1 billion in bank financing for Enron earlier this month. It was also hired to advise the company, which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken over by Dynegy. 
The old Chase, long a lending powerhouse, would have had a good shot at leading the bank financing, but an advisory role would have been less certain. Mr. Lee said the investment banker advising Enron came from the old J. P. Morgan. But with merger activity slow, there are few such deals to go around. 
The bank is also proud of its strength in long-term investment-grade bonds, another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger. It moved up to second place in that area so far this year, compared with sixth place a year ago. 
The bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings, a surge driven by today's low interest rates. In May J. P. Morgan Chase raised $12 billion in bonds for WorldCom, the telecommunications company, in the largest corporate debt deal in the United States on record. 
Unfortunately for J. P. Morgan Chase, the fees for underwriting investment-grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offerings of stock, where J. P. Morgan Chase remains a second-tier competitor. 
The bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of stock, falling to 9th place this year, compared with the old J. P. Morgan's 6th-place finish a year ago. (Chase was 11th.) 
Mr. Harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock offerings to build momentum slowly in that business. ''We think we have a chance in the second half of this year to be in the top five,'' he said. 
Given the slowdown, some bankers predict that Mr. Harrison will ultimately do another deal, either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolster weak areas in investment banking, like the equity division. 
''The general view is that the combination with J. P. Morgan didn't do enough,'' one investment banker said. 
Mr. Harrison disagrees: ''I don't feel,'' he said, ''we need to do another large deal to be successful.''

Morgan and Chase announced their merger in September 2000, the combination's strength in investment banking seemed sure to be successful.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Enron 'awaiting' capital injections, say officials.
By ROBERT CLOW.

11/23/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Officials working to shore up Enron's balance sheet yesterday said the struggling energy trader hoped to receive capital injections of more than $1.5bn as early as next week. 
Enron is in talks about $250m investments with JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup and is also hoping to raise at least $1bn from private equity investors.
People close to Enron declined to comment on which buyout firms might wish to invest in Enron. However, the Blackstone Group, which was reported to be talking to the company before Dynegy made its $9bn rescue bid, is understood no longer to be doing so. 
Members of the 20-strong bank lending group, led by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, are being asked to defer the maturities of their upcoming debt until after the completion of the merger. 
The moves comes as reports from Goldman Sachs and Fitch, the credit rating agency, raised questions about the company's cash flow and its medium-term viability. 
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, argued that cash balances were inadequate to meet $2.8bn of debt obligations falling due before the end of the year. 
People close to Enron say that nearly $1bn of that debt has already been restructured. 
The Fitch report said that if the Dynegy deal was not completed, Enron would struggle to meet $9bn of obligations due before the end of next year. 
People close to Enron insisted that Dynegy remained committed to the merger and played down talk of renegotiation. 
Dynegy would shortly issue a statement reasserting its commitment to the deal, they predicted.

USA: UPDATE 2-Enron bleeds again as Dynegy deal doubts grow.

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(dateline previous NEW YORK, changes byline, updates with bond prices, details throughout) 
By C. Bryson Hull
HOUSTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A long weekend of work faced Dynegy Inc. and proposed acquisition Enron Corp.,, whose worsening stock woes on Friday whipped up fear that the deal could be renegotiated or collapse entirely. 
Houston-based Dynegy and its advisers were expected to spend the long holiday weekend reviewing larger cross-town rival Enron's complex books, as both parties race against the decline in Enron's stock to complete the thorough financial examinations a merger requires. 
Enron shares ended down more than 5 percent, or 27 cents, to $4.74 at the close of abbreviated Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy shares closed up 64 cents, or 1.61 percent, to $40.40. 
Dynegy on Nov. 9 agreed to pay about $9 billion in stock for Enron. But, after falling 45 percent by Friday's close amid fears it could run out of cash before the deal closes, Enron's market capitalization is only about $4.03 billion. 
At Dynegy's current stock price, its offer for Enron is worth about $10.85 a share - more than twice Enron's current share price. 
Executives and advisers from both companies are in the final stages of the review, known as due diligence, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The sources said renegotiations had not been discussed as of Friday afternoon, and that such discussions could not occur until the due diligence review is finished. 
But should it turn up any more unpleasant surprises that qualify as a ""material adverse change"" in Enron's business, the likelihood increases of Dynegy invoking escape clauses or renegotiating, analysts and observers say. 
""You've got to believe there is that possibility. There is a 90 percent spread on the deal,"" said one analyst. ""There's unquestionably continued malaise in Enron's core business and Dynegy has left itself open to renegotiate with Enron."" 
UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone on Wednesday wrote in a research report that the likelihood was ""soaring"" that Dynegy might discover a material adverse change. 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said that, to her knowledge, Dynegy was not renegotiating the terms of the acquisition. 
She repeated that Enron was working on obtaining an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity funding to help shore up the balance sheet. 
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said due diligence was continuing and said the company remains optimistic about the merger. 
TRADERS FEARING RENEGOTIATION 
Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel of Enron that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability. Continued losses there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy. 
Electricity traders said the latest developments are making it seem more likely that Dynegy will renegotiate the deal or back out entirely, a move they said would leave Enron vulnerable to creditors and a possible bankruptcy. 
This week rating agency Fitch Investors said that if Dynegy stepped away from the merger, Enron's credit situation seemed untenable and a bankruptcy filing was highly possible. 
Traders, speaking on condition on anonymity, said they expected Dynegy to scramble over the weekend to narrow the growing share price gap. Enron's depleted market value and the shrinking volume in its EnronOnline trading system makes it more likely Dynegy could pull out, traders said. 
Meanwhile, energy traders reiterated that they would shy away from long-term deals with Enron unless they received substantial assurances the company's credit rating would soon improve. 
Enron's bonds on Friday were again talked at junk-bond levels, but even lower than before. 
Enron's 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and its 6.75 percent notes were bid Friday at 57 cents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on Wednesday, according to a trader. The notes yield to maturity a respective 21.5 percent and 17 percent. Its 20-year zero-coupon convertible bonds fell about 1 cent on the dollar to just over 33 cents. 
Enron is hovering at the edge of investment-grade as the three main credit trading agencies consider whether to cut them again, and some observers wonder how Enron has avoided it. 
""A bond trading in the 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade security,"" said Scott Smith, a principal at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco, where he invests $6 billion in debt and does not own Enron.

USA: Enron avoids junk status, but observers wonder how.
By Jonathan Stempel

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - It is rare that holding onto investment-grade credit ratings means as much to a company as it does now to beleaguered energy trader Enron Corp. , and some observers are wondering why a cut to junk status is taking so long. 
""The sum of all knowledge is in the valuation of the stock and the bonds,"" said Scott Smith, a principal at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco, where he invests $6 billion in debt, and does not own Enron. ""A bond trading in the 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade security.""
Enron's 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 percent notes were bid Friday at 57 cents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on Wednesday, a trader said. The notes yield to maturity 21.5 percent and 17 percent. 
Meanwhile, Enron's shares have sunk 94 percent this year. Since October 16, when it released third-quarter results, which it has since revised downward, its shares have fallen 86 percent, and its bonds by nearly half. 
Houston-based Enron, which is trying to merge with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. , has been rocked this year by accounting problems, earnings restatements, a federal investigation and a top management shuffle. 
Its advisers were expected this weekend to pore over the company's books, which could lead to a renegotiation of the merger, sources familiar with the matter said. 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have cut its senior unsecured debt ratings twice in the last month to their current ""Baa3"" and ""BBB-minus,"" their lowest investment grades. Fitch has cut its equivalent rating to ""BBB-minus,"" and all three agencies have warned of more possible cuts. 
The stakes could hardly be higher. 
CASH CRUNCH 
A downgrade to ""junk"" status could imperil Enron's trading business, force it to pay off as much as $3.9 billion of debt issued mostly by two trusts, and possibly force it to seek bankruptcy protection, analysts said. 
Enron said in a securities filing it recently had less than $2 billion of available cash and credit lines. 
S&P said on Tuesday that Enron faces ""liquidity issues,"" but enjoys an ""alignment of interests"" with its banks and a near-term financial position that ""is expected to be sufficient"" to allow the Dynegy merger. 
Fitch, meanwhile, said on Wednesday that ""our present 'BBB-minus' rating rests on the merger possibility and continued support of the lending banks."" 
If Dynegy walks away, it said, ""Enron's credit situation seems untenable with a bankruptcy filing highly possible."" 
Enron said on Monday it had $9.15 billion of obligations due through next year, and a $690 million note that could come due next Tuesday. It later said it got a three-week reprieve. 
INVESTMENT BANKS 
Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones Ratings Co. in Philadelphia, likened Enron's ratings situation to those of California's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison . 
Despite investor unease, those utilities kept their investment-grade ratings only until they defaulted on debt in January, as California's power crisis worsened. 
On November 8, a day before the Dynegy merger was announced, senior officials from Enron's lead banks - William Harrison, chief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. , and Michael Carpenter, who runs Citigroup Inc.'s investment banking arm - met with Moody's to help allay that agency's concerns, a person familiar with the meeting said. 
A day later, Moody's, which issued no statement on Enron this week, downgraded the company's senior unsecured debt rating, but only to its current ""Baa3."" 
""Pressure is coming from the investment banks, which have a vested interest in seeing the Dynegy deal go through,"" said Egan, whose agency rates Enron's debt ""BB,"" its second-highest junk grade. ""Investment banking fees will be substantial."" 
Companies pay for Moody's and S&P ratings, which they need to obtain financing. Egan said his agency receives no such payments. 
Citigroup and J.P. Morgan declined to comment. Moody's and S&P did not immediately return phone calls. Fitch was not immediately available for comment. Dynegy and Enron on Wednesday, however, reaffirmed their commitment to the merger. 
Wells Capital's Smith isn't sure what to expect. 
""Enron will remain definitively investment grade if the merger as billed goes through, ... but there are half a dozen things that could go wrong,"" he said. ""Obviously, the equity markets are telling you it's very skeptical the merger will go through, and the bond market is following its lead.""

USA: US Corp Bonds-Enron slips again in quiet market.
By Jonathan Stempel

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. corporate bond market saw very little activity on Friday, with many traders leaving even in advance of the early close, though Enron Corp.'s bonds weakened for a third straight session amid concern over the energy trader's liquidity, and whether its merger with Dynegy Inc. can go through. 
""Deadly"" was how one trader described activity. Spreads, the yield difference between investment-grade bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries, finished unchanged on balance, as did junk bond prices, traders said.
Enron's 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and its 6.75 percent notes were bid at 57 cents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on Wednesday, according to a trader. The notes yield to maturity a respective 21.5 percent and 17 percent. Its 20-year zero-coupon convertible bonds fell about 1 cent on the dollar to just over 33 cents. 
Meanwhile, Enron's shares fell 5.4 percent, as its advisers prepared this weekend to pore over the company's books, sources familiar with the matter said. Analysts said there could be a renegotiation of the Dynegy merger. 
""The sum of all knowledge is in the valuation of the stock and the bonds,"" said Scott Smith, a principal at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco, where he invests $6 billion of debt, none from Enron. ""A bond trading in the 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade security."" 
Ten-year Treasuries closed down 12/32, as their yields rose to 5.011 percent. 
JUNK BOND FUNDS ENJOY INFLOWS 
Separately, investors poured cash into U.S. junk bond mutual funds for a second straight week amid a newfound tolerance for riskier assets. 
Investors added a net $628.5 million of cash to the funds in the week ending Tuesday, on top of $816.3 million in the prior week, according to AMG Data Services. 
The two-week inflow is the largest since the second and third week of January. The bonds rose more than 6 percent that month, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. 
""Financial markets have rallied on hopes that the economy will get better in the not-too-distant future,"" said Jan Hatzius, senior economist at Goldman Sachs & Co. ""A lot of the optimism right now is hope rather than reality, but we should see signs of improvement in a month or two."" 
Through Thursday, junk bonds have returned 2.93 percent in November alone, beating all other bonds, and are up 4.71 percent this year, Merrill Lynch data show. The bonds still yield 7.98 percentage points more than Treasuries, but that's down from 9.29 percentage points at the start of the month. 
Companies this week sold about $3.83 billion of investment-grade, $533 million of junk, and $3.3 billion of convertible debt. Investors expect about three more weeks of overall active issuance before the usual year-end slowdown.

USA: Enron shares seesaw on concerns over Dynegy deal.

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. fluctuated wildly on Friday morning, as concerns grew over rival Dynegy Inc.'s $9 billion acquisition of the beleaguered energy trader. 
Enron shares were down 8 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $4.93 in Friday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after diving more than 8 percent earlier.
The shares are down because of talk that the terms of Dynegy's deal with Enron could be changed or that the deal could collapse. 
Dynegy originally agreed to pay about $9 billion in stock for Enron. But, after falling 42 percent since then by Wednesday's close, Enron now sports a market capitalization of only about $4.26 billion. 
In a report on Wednesday, Ronald Barone, an analyst at UBS Warburg, suggested that the deal's current exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of Dynegy for each share of Enron could well be readjusted. 
He suggested that a much lower exchange ratio of 0.15 was more realistic. 
""You've got to believe there is that possibility. There is a 90 percent spread on the deal,"" said one analyst, referring to a potential renegotiation. 
""There's unquestionably continued malaise in Enron's core business and Dynegy has left itself open to renegotiate with Enron,"" he continued. 
Some of Enron's trading partners have scaled back their activity, causing that ""malaise."" Lower volumes at its trading business, which is the largest and most coveted portion of its operation, could cause fourth-quarter earnings to come in below expectations, Enron has said.

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders' Perfect Storm Stalls
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/23/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here's one 2001 outlook that couldn't have been more wrong. 
Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting ""the perfect storm"" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy trading business one to watch in 2001.
Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That was followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices were headed down, not up. 
And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE). 
Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high gas prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters. 
The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about where traditional utilities trade. 
And the chance for recovery in 2002? 
Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is willing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is currently between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of time before the stocks get there. 
""They were just recovering from Gray Davis,"" Mullick said, referring to the governor of California, who had accused ""out-of-state"" energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the state's energy crisis. ""Now, they are recovering from Enron."" 
The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group. 
""Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates,"" he said. ""I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety utility."" 
Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategies and financial disclosures. 
Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create. 
Answers Elude Investors 

Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want. 
Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. 
Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. 
Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. 
Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. 
""All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not,"" he said. 
He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. 
At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. 
Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. 
Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. 
Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). 
According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. 
""We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are,"" O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens. 
As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O'Brien. 
""One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays,"" O'Brien said. 
That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall.

U.S. Energy Exhange May Scrap Online Platform Plans
By Stephen Parker
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/23/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The world's largest energy futures exchange is taking a second look at plans to launch a major new electronic trading platform known as eNymex, and may decide to scrap them. 
Management changes at the New York Mercantile Exchange, along with the success of Access, an online platform the exchange expanded in September, have prompted the move.
Nymex may decide to combine parts of eNymex with Access, according to sources close to the matter. It is also exploring the idea of alliances with other exchanges, and considering developing ""e-mini"" contracts - smaller energy contracts for Internet-based trade by retail investors. 
""There's new management in place at the exchange,"" said Nymex spokeswoman Nachamah Jacobovits. ""They're rethinking all of our business strategies, and one very massive strategy was the idea of this major eNymex B2B (business-to-business) system launch with a whole new slate of products."" 
Nymex and GlobalView Software Inc., a company that initially worked on building the eNymex trading system, have sued each other in a dispute over work on the project. 
Kiodex, an electronic-trading technology firm that has developed the back end of the eNymex system, took on added development work for the project after GlobalView departed. The trade engine Kiodex was asked to build is ""substantially complete, but the company can't speak to Nymex's overall electronic-trading strategy,"" a Kiodex source said. 
The eNymex platform was conceived as a forum for trading over-the-counter energy products, but Nymex has already moved ahead with plans for trading some of them on Access, initially an overnight trading system that was expanded in September. It hopes, for example, to launch gas swaps based on delivery at the Henry Hub within the next six weeks on Access, Jacobovits said. 
""We've expedited plans for a Henry Hub natural gas swap contract,"" Jacobovits said. ""Traders could be looking for OTC clearing on a neutral-based platform, which is a factor in that decision."" 
Before Sept. 14, Access was used only to trade energy futures at night, after the day's Nymex session had ended. Use was limited to Nymex members with dedicated phone systems. 
The exchange had been planning to expand use of Access, but ended up doing so sooner than it had expected. On Sept. 14, it started offering Access trading over the Internet, a move that will eventually allow Nymex to open up trade to more users. 
The move was intended to help keep futures markets liquid after the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. Nymex's building, located near where the trade towers stood, was shut down for several days after the attacks. Expanding its already existent Access system to the Internet helped ease potential liquidity problems that could have arisen from shortened floor trading hours after Nymex reopened. 
Development of the eNymex system began last year under the direction of former Nymex Chairman Daniel Rappaport. In August, Nymex said it would launch the eNymex platform within four to eight months. New Nymex President J. Robert ""Bo"" Collins Jr. said then that vendor problems had slowed development of the system's front-end technology and caused the delays. But he still expected eNymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original product line. 
If Nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as eNymex with Access, the new system may end up being known as eNymex. 
""eNymex right now is looking for a new mission,"" said an industry source close to Nymex. ""You know how politics works. We don't scrap it, we just rename it. Anything we do electronically is now going to be called eNymex. But the original deal and concept that Rappaport initiated is done."" 
Nymex's reconsideration comes as the energy-trading world undergoes rapid change. The two most successful online energy trading platforms -- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) EnronOnline, and IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE -- have seen their luck turn - in opposite directions. 
Enron Corp. (ENE), which accounts for about 25% of the trade in U.S. power and gas markets, faces questions about its creditworthiness as the Securities and Exchange Commission investigates complicated financial dealings. Enron's possible merger with Dynegy Inc. (DYN), now appears to be in doubt, and energy trading companies are pulling back their exposure to the company. 
Enron executes about 60% of its power and gas trades on EnronOnline. When Enron's troubles surfaced last month, Nymex quickly moved to extend its clearing services to over-the-counter natural gas derivatives, a move the trading community saw as an attempt to grab market share. 
ICE, on the other hand, is moving ahead with plans to capture more energy trade on its electronic format. ICE closed a deal this summer to acquire the London-based International Petroleum Exchange - Nymex's chief competitor and Europe's largest traditional energy exchange. It plans to move all IPE energy contracts to its Internet-based system and offer clearing services for some over-the-counter contracts. 
Nymex is exploring alliances that could give it a better footing in the new competitive landscape. One idea under review is a joint venture with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to offer e-mini contracts for Nymex products on CME's Globex electronic-trading system, the person close to Nymex said. 
Nymex officials wouldn't confirm whether they're talking with the CME, but they said the relationship between the exchanges is a warm one. 
""Nymex is always open to strategic alliances,"" Jacobovits said. ""There's nothing we've agreed to at this point, but we have open dialogue with a number of exchanges concerning strategic alliances. We have a good relationship with the Chicago Merc, and we certainly would be open to working with them."" 
Shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York shut down the Nymex trading floor, the CME said it would be willing to offer Nymex products on its Globex system until Nymex resumed operations, Jacobovits said.

Enron Woes May Endanger Plans For Mozambique Steel Proj

11/23/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP)--The recent downturn in fortunes for U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) may quash hopes for the construction of a natural gas-fueled factory to produce steel slabs for export in Mozambique, officials said Friday. 
One of the largest companies in the U.S., Enron is struggling amid potentially new cash-flow and earnings problems. The Houston-based company was to invest $1.1 billion in the Maputo Iron and Steel Project, a factory that once built, was expected to produce two million tons of steel slabs a year.
But Mozambican Prime Minister Pacoal Mocumbi said that the government hoped that, ""Enron's current difficulties will not lead to the cancellation of the project."" 
""My government wants to know from Enron what is going on so that we are not held hostage to a lack of information,"" Mocumbi said. 
No immediate comment was available from Enron officials in Mozambique. 
The planned project is part of long-standing efforts to exploit vast natural gas reserves in Mozambique and transport and sell the product into the industrial heartland of South Africa. 
Mozambique has two massive gas fields: Temane is operated by the U.S.'s Atlantic Richfield Co., Sasol of South Africa, and Zarara Petroleum of Dubai, while Pande is operated by Enron.

STOCKWATCH Enron down, Dynegy up on lingering merger uncertainty

11/23/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp shares were lower, while Dynegy Inc was slightly higher in late morning trade on lingering uncertainty about their proposed merger following a news report that Enron's SEC filing last Monday contained details that were not known to acquirer Dynegy, dealers said. 
At 11.15 am, Enron shares were trading down 17 cents at 4.84, a decline of 3.3 pct. Dynegy was up 44 cents at 40.20.
The DJIA was up 57.70 points at 9,892.86. The S&P 500 was up 6.24 points at 1,143.27. The Nasdaq composite was up 11.94 points at 1,886.99 
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal quoted an unnamed source as saying Monday's SEC filing contained information on the company which was unknown to proposed buyer Dynegy. 
Dynegy representatives are planning to work through the weekend evaluating the significance of this information as part of their due diligence on Enron, the paper said. It did not specify the nature of the information. 
In the filing, Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27. 
On Wednesday, the company said it had received an extension on the repayment until mid-December, which it said was enough time to restructure the debt. 
The company also said it was in active talks with its creditors and expected to be able to restructure other debt and remain solvent long enough for the merger with Dynegy to be completed. 
Dynegy welcomed the news and said it will push ahead in seeking regulatory approval for the merger. But investors are concerned that the constant surprises in restated earnings and revelations of liquidity problems at Enron may cause Dynegy to walk away from the deal. 
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone lowered Enron's fourth-quarter earnings per share estimate to a loss of 25 cents from earnings of 25 cents, arguing that its business will suffer until its liquidity problems are resolved. 
The analyst cut his full year estimate to 1.10 usd from 1.60 usd and 2002 estimate to 75 cents from 1.65 cents. 
If his figures prove to be correct, they would make Dynegy's current merger exchange terms -- of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for each Enron share owned -- moderately dilutive. 
""We reiterate that if the merger with Dynegy were to run into obstacles (or fall through entirely) Enron shares could come under severe pressure as investors may question its ability to sustain liquidity (and normal business activities) for an extended period of time,"" Barone said in a note. ""Under such a scenario, bankruptcy would not be out of the question."" 
Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer was more upbeat, and said the share's decline in recent sessions has been overdone. 
""Our industry contacts and discussions with traders indicate that while trading with Enron has slowed, it certainly has not stopped,"" said Launer. 
For Dynegy, the merger with Enron still ""represents a dramatic plus,"" he said.

USA: Houston economy seen weathering major layoffs.
By Ellen Chang

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Houston's economy, buffered by a broad and diverse tax base, should be able to weather thousands of layoffs from some of the city's major corporations, including energy powerhouse Enron Corp., economists and analysts said. 
Financially ailing Enron Corp. , which has 21,000 employees worldwide and is in talks to be bought by Houston-based rival Dynegy Inc. , is the third major employer in the city to announce severe financial problems in recent months. Analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs.
Continental announced a layoff of 3,000 employees after the Sept. 11 attacks and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp. will, if finalized, result in 15,000 layoffs at the two companies. Compaq also announced 8,000 layoffs worldwide in July. 
""It's fair to say that the potential layoffs at Enron and the layoffs at Continental, taken alone, are negative factors, although probably small in the grand scope of the Houston economy,"" said Phil Scheps, director of Houston's finance and administration department. 
Since last month when Enron became a target of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships, the energy giant's market share has steadily eroded. 
While neither Enron nor Dynegy have given any indication of the number of layoffs that could hit Houston, Barton Smith, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston, said the layoffs ""will be spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive."" 
Robin Kapiloff, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said the city's efforts to diversify its economy over the past decade will protect its revenue collections, even as some of the city's biggest employers suffer. ""We're watching to see where things go now,"" she said. 
Alex Fraser, a director at Standard & Poor's, said the ratings agency isn't concerned about Houston's credit position at this point. ""While Enron is certainly a large player and prominent corporation, we're unclear on what the impact would be."" 
While the fourth largest city in the country experienced a bit of a slowdown since the Sept. 11 attacks, Houston has outperformed the rest of the nation. 
With a tax base of $87.3 billion in 2001, Houston is also buffered by the Texas Medical Center, the city's largest employer. Next year the city's tax base is estimated to grow to $95 billion. 
Still, the national recession, energy price weakness in general, and the initial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the city to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to 1.5 percent from 5 percent. That revised estimate equals a $13 million reduction in the city's $1.4 billion budget. 
But the city's property tax revenue has not been affected. Only a small change in property tax collections is expected in 2002 because valuations are based on Jan. 1 data and for most of 2001, real estate growth was very large, Scheps said. 
While recent economic indicators appear positive, and consumer confidence has quickly rebounded, a better read on the strength of Houston's tax revenue collections will be available in February when the city receives data for the December holiday season, Scheps said.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- An official from India's Dabhol Power Co. confirmed Friday that a panel of arbitrators will meet in Singapore Saturday to discuss international arbitration proceedings initiated by DPC against Maharashtra state government. 
Dabhol, a 2,184 megawatt power project in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, is a unit of the U.S.-based energy company Enron Corp. (ENE).
Dabhol Power Co. initiated the arbitration against the state government for not honoring its guarantees on power bills due for December 2000 and January, following Maharashtra State Electricity Board's failure to meet payments. 
The Singapore meeting is likely to be followed by the actual arbitration process in the London court, according to a Friday report in the Hindu Business Line daily. 
The panel, which has been appointed by DPC and the Maharashtra state government, includes an independent observer.

Enron SEC filing contained information Dynegy was unaware of - report

11/23/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Monday's SEC filing by Enron's Corp contained information that proposed buyer Dynegy Inc had not known about, the Wall Street Journal quoted a person familiar with the merger plans as saying. 
Dynegy representatives plan to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company's due diligence on Enron, the source said, without specifying what the new information was. 
In the filing, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of dollars of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than 2 bln usd in loans by the end of the year.
Dynegy announced Wednesday that it is working to accelerate regulatory approvals required to complete the acquisition in accordance with the previously announced agreement. 
The Journal quoted analysts as saying Dynegy is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the deal. 
It also cited Fitch director Ralph Pellecchia as saying that, without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing ""is highly possible"".

Dynegy's Decision to Buy Enron Hits Crossroads Amid Rising Financial Woes

11/23/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multibillion-dollar deal, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron (ENE) shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading company, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $2 billion in loans by the end of the year. 
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharply lower, market observers said. 
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dynegy (DYN) shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each. 
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said his company was working ""to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement"" though it continued to perform ""due diligence"" on Enron. 
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe enough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier this year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to complete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit. 
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal, two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders would have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set. 
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enron contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It couldn't be determined what the new information was. 
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to Dynegy. 
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price. 
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. Initially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officials have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year, would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings. 
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial problems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a ""likely scenario"" is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15 Dynegy share for each Enron share.

Employees' Lawuit Says Enron Hurt Retirement Funds Courts: The suit claims the energy firm urged workers to invest in company stock just before it plunged.
From Associated Press

11/23/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
C-2
Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

HOUSTON -- Two Enron Corp. workers are suing the company, claiming it endangered their retirement funds. 
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Houston under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, asserts that Enron encouraged the employees to invest more heavily in company stock just before the stock tanked. The lawsuit was filed by Portland, Ore., utility lineman Roy Rinard and co-worker Steve Lacey.
Enron shares have plunged more than 90% over the last several months since the departure of the company's chief executive and an accounting controversy that prompted the firm to restate its earnings since 1997, eliminating more than $580 million of reported income. 
Steve Berman, managing partner for the law firm of Hagens Berman in Seattle, said Enron touted the value of its shares and encouraged employees to put their entire portfolio into Enron stock. 
Enron officials didn't emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation as positive, especially when the company's stock began to slide, said Berman, who is hoping to get the suit certified as a class action. 
Berman wants to prove that the company's 401(k) plan executives failed to act responsibly when they knew about serious business problems. He's also hoping to break new legal ground with his case. 
The lawsuit is patterned after a case against Lucent Technologies in which Lucent employees sued their employer this summer for matching their 401(k) contributions with company stock that tanked. That case is still in litigation. 
Earlier this year, Rinard, 54, had $472,000 in his Enron 401(k) plan, which had been growing for 21 years. 
Today, his plan is worth about $40,000. Enron gives its employees their 401(k) match in company stock. 
In January, Enron was trading for $84.87. Wednesday it closed at $5.01 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The problem was compounded when many employees, including Rinard, saw Enron's stock doing so well that they decided to put their entire account into Enron stock. 
Enron executives had talked about how the stock price was poised to climb above $100 a share, Rinard told the Houston Chronicle. 
In addition, Enron employees were not allowed to make trades in the 401(k) plan for about a month, starting Oct. 17. That was the day after Enron surprised the market with the news it was taking a $1.01-billion after-tax third-quarter charge to get out of bad investments. 
Enron officials, who could not be reached, have said they had planned the lockdown for several months because the company was changing plan administrators.

Portland utility's fate tied to Enron's future

Fourth

(Copyright 2001)

LOS ANGELES -- Oregon's largest utility, Portland General Electric, faces an uncertain future as its parent Enron fights for its life amid a deepening financial crisis, industry experts said Wednesday. 
Another Oregon utility, Northwest Natural Gas, is due to file next week with state regulators for approval to take over Portland General. Those same regulators could soon be faced with a similar application from Dynegy as part of a still-pending deal to acquire cash-strapped Enron.
If Enron were to file for bankruptcy before Portland General has been sold, its future could be thrown into the hands of a Texas bankruptcy court, experts said. 
Northwest Natural Gas agreed Oct. 8 to acquire Portland General for around $1.8 billion, plus about $1.1 billion in assumed debt and preferred stock. A month later, Enron announced it had agreed to be acquired by Houston-based Dynegy. 
""We've been watching this from afar to see how it could impact that sale (Portland General's acquisition by Northwest Natural Gas),"" said Roy Hemmingway, chairman of the Oregon Public Utility Commission. 
""We have authority if that sale doesn't go through to rule on whether Dynegy can take over Enron,"" he said. 
Ratings agency Fitch last week cut Portland General's debt ratings due to ""uncertainty at its parent Enron."" Wednesday, the same agency said a bankruptcy filing by Enron was ""highly possible"" if the proposed rescue by Dynegy collapses. 
""We haven't seen any credit problems so far, and Portland General isn't in the market (buying power for its customers) right now in a big way,"" Hemmingway said. 
However, he noted that, ""If they really were unable to conduct their business because they were not creditworthy we would have to use whatever instruments are available"" to make sure service to customers is maintained. Earlier this year, California was forced to take over buying power for the PG&E unit of Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International subsidiary Southern California Edison after the two utilities saw their credit ratings cut to junk status. 
Federal regulators have insisted the sellers of wholesale power have the right to sell to a creditworthy buyer. 
California's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, chose to file for bankruptcy because of its mounting debt. In a parallel, consumer advocates fear the fate of the biggest utility in neighboring Oregon could end up in the hands of a bankruptcy judge. 
Hemmingway said the Oregon Public Utility Commission recently had granted Portland General a rate increase and the utility has ""plenty of cash flow currently to handle its obligations."" 
""This is nothing like California where that was not the case,"" he said. 
Northwest Natural Gas, which is also based in Portland, has set a target of filing next Wednesday with the Oregon commission to take over the utility, spokesman Steve Sechrist said. 
""We have no concerns whatsoever at this point. The deal is moving forward and there is no reason we can see why it should not"" he said, noting the delay to the filing was the result of the complexities of the acquisition. 
Jason Eisdorfer, a lawyer for the Citizens' Utility Board of Oregon, said major questions would be raised if Enron went under before the deal were completed. 
""Would the (bankruptcy) judge let the terms of the agreement go forward. I don't know. There is a risk that Portland General will become an asset to be disposed of under bankruptcy,"" Eisdorfer said.

Enron Shares and Bonds Fall on Concern About Takeover (Update5)

Enron Shares and Bonds Fall on Concern About Takeover (Update5)

     (Updates with Dynegy comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares and bonds
fell for a third day on concern the company's weakened financial
condition and plunging stock price may lead Dynegy Inc. to try to
cancel or rework a takeover of the biggest energy trader.

     Shares of Enron, the most-active U.S. stock, dropped
30 cents, or 6 percent, to $4.71. They fell 45 percent Tuesday and
Wednesday after Enron said it may have to pay more than $9 billion
in debt due by 2003. Enron 6.4 percent bonds due in July 2006 were
bid at 55 cents on the dollar, down from 62 cents on Wednesday,
traders said.

     Enron shares are trading at less than half the value of
Dynegy's offer, which shows investors are questioning whether the
buyout will be completed on the terms agreed to two weeks ago.
Enron's financial woes may prove to be a drag on Dynegy's earnings
next year if the transaction is completed, analysts said.

     ``There are continued doubts about the deal,'' said UBS
Warburg analyst Ronald Barone, who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy''
and doesn't own shares in either company. ``Enron's earnings
aren't what they used to be because they've lost trading business.
Given that, Dynegy has an opportunity to renegotiate the price.''

     Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the company ``remains
optimistic for the potential of the merger.'' Enron agreed Nov. 9
to the takeover, now valued at about $23 billion in stock and
assumed debt, after a financial crisis threatened it with
bankruptcy.

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
a $690 million note due next week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck
Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the
note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit
facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.

     More than 40 million Enron shares changed hands today, almost
twice their three-month daily average, in a session shortened
because of the Thanksgiving holiday. Enron was the most-active
U.S. stock on Wednesday, with 116 million shares traded. Dynegy
shares rose 64 cents to $40.40 today.

                       Less Than $2 Billion

     In a Securities & Exchange Commission filing Monday, Enron
said it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If
the company's cash reserves run too low, Enron is in danger of
seeing its credit rating cut below investment grade. That would
trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated
partnerships.

     Enron's bankers have met with unidentified investors,
including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies, in
a bid to shore up the energy trader's finances with an injection
of as much as $2 billion, the New York Times reported yesterday,
citing unidentified executives close to the companies.

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company is seeking
$500 million to $1 billion. Enron needs to raise $1 billion to
$1.5 billion in cash within the next 45 days, said Sean Egan,
managing director of Egan-Jones Rating Co.

     ``Their trading operation has burned through cash faster than
the market had expected,'' Egan said.

                         Trading Business

     Traders including Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. have said they
shifted transactions away from Enron after its plunging stock
price prompted concerns about creditworthiness. Enron has said
fourth-quarter earnings would be reduced partly by a drop in its
energy-trading business.

     Watson said after the Enron buyout was announced he expected
it to increase 2002 earnings by 35 percent. Analysts said that
can't happen unless Enron recovers lost trading business. Several
have cut their 2002 estimates for Enron. The average estimate of
analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call for next year is
now $1.68 a share, down from $2.14 a month ago.

     Dynegy can cancel or renegotiate if Enron can't meet debt
payments, its trading market collapses, banks demand more
collateral or raise the interest rate for loans, Enron's credit
rating is cut to junk, the SEC cites Enron for securities fraud,
or if Enron's legal liabilities including shareholder suits exceed
$3.5 billion, Egan said.


                     Will Dynegy Renegotiate?

     Dynegy officials were considering whether to try and
renegotiate terms of its agreement with Enron, according to the
New York Times report. Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston.

     ``Dynegy investors would like to see the company negotiate a
lower price for Enron,'' said Credit Lyonnais securities analyst
Gordon Howald, who rates Dynegy ``buy'' and owns no shares.

     Under the Nov. 9 terms, Enron investors would receive 0.2685
Dynegy share for each share held. At today's closing price, that
values Enron stock at $10.85. A year ago, Enron traded at almost
$80.

     Investors worry that a cancellation of the merger would push
Enron into bankruptcy.

     ``The market is saying there seems to be no obvious Plan B
for Enron and that is what has investors concerned,'' said Eric
Bergson, who helps manage $9 billion of fixed-income assets at
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``The lower bond prices go, what
the market is saying is that there's less chance of this deal
going through.''

KKR, Blackstone Are Among Likely Enron Investors, Analyst Says
2001-11-23 16:20 (New York)

KKR, Blackstone Are Among Likely Enron Investors, Analyst Says

     Houston, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &
Co., the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group are among the
likely candidates to be approached by Enron Corp. for a private
equity investment to shore up the company's balance sheet, said
industry analyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.

     The firms have cash on hand and have invested in energy
companies in the past. An investment in Enron may look attractive
now that its shares have plunged by 94 percent this year.

     ``Many of the larger, more traditional buyout firms would
find this deal attractive,'' said Snow. ``This is a company that
has real assets that is down in the dumps and has need of capital
when capital is scarce.''

     Enron's bankers met recently with leveraged buyout firms and
two industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times
reported, citing executives close to the companies. Enron's stock
fell for a fifth day in six on concern the company's weakened
financial condition may lead Dynegy Inc. to try to cancel or
rework its planned purchase of the rival Houston company.

     Investors may inject as much as $2 billion under arrangements
that would protect them from further declines in Enron's stock,
the Times said. The new investments would be in Enron's
Transwestern Pipeline, which connects natural-gas fields in Texas
to the California market, the newspaper said.

     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. agreed to terms
that give each of them a $250 million equity stake as part of a
transaction to be completed Monday, officials told the newspaper.

     Buyout firms sometimes make collective bids, pooling their
money and distributing the risk. The firms also like to invest in
industries that are out of favor with public investors and to do
so in partnership with corporate investors, like Dynegy, said
Snow.

     ``You need to know enough about the (energy) business to know
whether it's a good deal, and then you need to be confident in the
Dynegy team,'' he said.

                                KKR

     KKR, the second-biggest private equity firm with $24 billion
in assets, declined comment on Enron through spokeswoman Molly
Morse of Kekst & Co.

     The New York-based firm invested more than $1.3 billion in
DPL Inc., a utility in Dayton, Ohio, and will receive $550 million
of that back from the company after DPL sold $700 million of bonds
in August.

     ``KKR very much gets involved in deals where there's a
corporate partner and they don't have a majority stake,'' Snow
said. ``They would possibly hold it for years, because they like
slow exits.'' KKR is also a possible candidate because it recently
raised a new $5 billion buyout fund.

     Any LBO firm would need assurance about how it will get its
money back on an Enron investment, said Snow.

     ``The thing they have to be cautious about is the exit,'' he
said. ``If there's a chance Dynegy would agree to buy out (the LBO
firms') stake over time, that would give some confidence. But if
the only exit is the public market, that's a little bit dicier.''

     Any private investment also must be large enough to make a
meaningful difference: Enron's market value is $3.7 billion and
Dynegy has proposed paying $23 billion in stock and assumption of
debt. That means the private equity portion would have to approach
$1 billion or more.

     The 20 largest private equity firms have assets of more than
$5 billion under management each, according to Asset Alternatives,
a Wellesley, Massachusetts industry research firm. Still, many of
those firms don't have enough free capital to undertake an
investment of $500 million or more.

     An announcement of an investment may come soon, analysts say.
Energy trading firms such as Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. are
doing fewer trades with Enron because of concern that the company
won't be able to finance its business. Enron shares have fallen by
almost half in the past three sessions.

     ``They're going to need this investment within 30 to 45
days,'' said Sean Egan of Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``They're
spiraling downward and they're going to need some more beyond the
$1.5 billion contributed by'' ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26
percent of Dynegy.

                            Other LBOs

     Here's a rundown of the other most likely private equity
partners for Enron:

     --The Carlyle Group could invest through a $1 billion energy
fund it's raising, as well as its general U.S. buyout fund, said
Snow. Carlyle's vice president for corporate communications, Chris
Ullman, declined to comment.

     --Blackstone, which has a history of investing alongside
other corporate partners, recently closed on a $4 billion buyout
fund. Blackstone spokesman John Ford declined to comment on
whether Enron had approached the firm.

     --Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, which is based in Texas like
Dynegy and Enron. Hicks Muse counts Triton Energy Ltd., an energy
exploration company, among its best investments. The firm recently
raised about $1.5 billion for new investments, about one-third of
what it had hoped to raise, and has said it will focus on ``back-
to-basics'' investments in food, manufacturing and media. Mark
Semer, a spokesman for Hicks Muse who also works for Kekst,
declined comment on Enron.

     Spokesmen for two other firms, Warburg Pincus & Co. and
Credit Suisse First Boston's private equity arm, didn't return
calls seeking comment.

Microsoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit
2001-11-23 11:59 (New York)

Microsoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit

     Redmond, Washington Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.'s
plans to expand its MSN high-speed Internet service have been
delayed by a lawsuit from Enron Corp., which could cost the
company customers during the holiday season, analysts said.

     MSN had planned to have fast Internet access over telephone
lines available, with help from energy trader Enron, in 45 markets
starting Oct. 25. Instead, the service is now on sale in about 30
markets, said MSN Product Manager Lisa Gurry.

     The latest delay follows a string of apparent bad luck that
has delayed the rollout of Microsoft's fast Internet access
service over the last year. The holidays are typically a popular
time for customers to buy so-called broadband access, often along
with new personal computers purchased or received as gifts.

     ``They have a track record of picking broadband partners that
don't quite work out,'' said Joe Laszlo, senior analyst at market
researcher Jupiter Media Metrix Inc. ``It definitely hurts them
with customers who want broadband right now.''

     Subscribers to fast Internet access services are expected to
grow fourfold by 2006, according to estimates by Jupiter Media
Metrix, while sales of slower Internet access plans decline. Fast
Internet service over phone lines uses digital subscriber line, or
DSL, technology.

                         On Track

     Gurry said Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is still on
track to have fast access for sale by the end of March to 90
percent of the 45 million to 50 million households that have DSL
available in their neighborhoods.

     ``There is very little growth left in the dial-up access
space for Microsoft or anybody, which leaves them with broadband
as the only potential growth area for the MSN access business,''
said Youssef Squali, an analyst at FAC/Equities, who rates
Microsoft Internet competitor AOL Time Warner Inc. a ``buy.''

     Microsoft also wants to deliver consumer services like music
and video and software updates, which require fast Internet access
for smooth downloads.

     The company originally began a service with NorthPoint
Communications Group Inc., a now-bankrupt provider of fast Web
access. Microsoft has also had difficulty finding partners among
cable companies who use their networks for high-speed service.

     Now Houston-based Enron, which agreed in June to provide the
backbone for a nationwide expansion of MSN's service, is suing.
Enron claimed in its lawsuit that it isn't required to deliver
broadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing
and ordering system that the biggest software company agreed to
build.

     Enron, which is being acquired by rival Dynegy Inc., recently
disclosed debts of $9.15 billion due by 2003 and restated earnings
for four years.

                        Slower Expansion

     MSN has been selling high-speed access in 14 states under
partnership with Qwest Communications International Inc. for the
last few months. MSN has begun the planned service expansion
outside of those states by working with Enron competitors that MSN
Marketing Director Bob Visse declined to name. The company is also
talking to Enron, he said. Enron didn't return calls for comment.

     Because of the Enron suit the expansion is moving slower than
expected, Visse said. Since Oct. 25, MSN has added service in Los
Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento, California, and
Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, Texas, giving Microsoft a
total of about 30 markets rather than 45. Plans to expand
marketing are also on hold, Visse said.

     ``It is very unfortunate that we are in the position we are
in,'' said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.

     Top U.S. Internet service provider America Online, owned by
AOL Time Warner Inc., has also been slow to get into the high-
speed market, analysts said.

     That doesn't mean Microsoft is in the clear. Laszlo said both
MSN and AOL might pay for their sluggishness with tougher
competition from third-place EarthLink Inc. and from cable and
telephone companies that have more experience selling high-speed
Internet access.

     America Online has more than 31 million subscribers to MSN's
7 million. EarthLink Inc. has 4.77 million subscribers. Laszlo
doesn't think MSN or America Online can build the kind of lead in
the high-speed market that America Online has in the slower dial-
up access market.

                       `Not a Permanent Blow'

     Not that anyone need worry about Microsoft. MSN will be able
to expand its fast Internet access business even with the delays,
Laszlo said.

     ``They are already late in the broadband market so this means
they get a little later,'' he said. ``But broadband will continue
to grow over the next few years and this is definitely not a
permanent blow.''

     Analysts also say Microsoft still needs to find a cable
partner that will let MSN use its network to sell fast access over
cable lines. Cable is more popular than DSL with customers looking
for fast Web service. The five largest cable providers control 51
percent of the U.S. high-speed Internet market. The five largest
sellers of access via phone lines and DSL technology account for
about 33 percent, according to market researcher ARS Inc.

     Microsoft MSN Vice President Yusuf Mehdi said last month the
company may be interested in an investment in AT&T Corp.'s cable-
television unit, which AT&T is considering selling. Ballmer
declined to comment on Microsoft's plans.

TECHNOLOGY: BROADBAND
Enron Leaves Void In Commodity Trades
By SIMON ROMERO

The New York Times
Page 3, Column 4
c. 2001 New York Times Company

After the collapse of Enron, people wondered who would pick up the slack in the commodity trading of broadband communications capacity. The answer: nobody. 
Aside from a handful of bit players that specialize in brokering tailor-made deals, the bandwidth market collapsed before it was even able to attain the liquidity necessary to thrive.
The disappearance of bandwidth trading altogether is now being discussed, to the dismay of Enron-inspired operations at big companies like El Paso, Williams and Dynegy that bet heavily on the market's potential. Yet such a development should be no small surprise, given bandwidth trading's early handicaps. 
After the feverish expansion of fiber optic networks in the late 1990's, an overwhelming glut of capacity on these systems sent bandwidth prices plunging. Faced with cheap contracts and slower-than-expected growth in Internet usage, telecommunications companies found little need to participate in a secondary market for capacity because they were almost drowning in it. 
The collapse of the dot-coms and speculation that trades among big bandwidth-trading players were often little more than fancy financial maneuvering engineered to suggest growing volumes did little to help. Even before Enron's fall, the austere market claimed its victims, with players like Asia Capacity Exchange and GTX.com falling by the wayside, Ovum, a consulting firm, noted in a recent report. 
A recovery in bandwidth prices appears a distant dream. Moreover, it was never easy for rough-and-tumble energy traders to convince large telecommunications concerns why they should agree to make a commodity of their core offering. 
The fanciful business of trading bandwidth was more a symptom than a cause of the fin de siecle telecommunications debacle. SIMON ROMERO

Manager's Journal: Dare to Keep Your Stock Price Low
By Joseph Fuller and Michael C. Jensen

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Egged on by a buoyant economy and the pace of value creation set by the market's best performers, over the past two decades securities analysts challenged the companies they covered to reach for unprecedented earnings growth. Too often managers collaborated in this fiction, either because they had unrealistic expectations for their companies or, worse yet, because they used analysts' expectations to set internal corporate goals. When the fiction finally became obvious the results were massive adjustments in growth projections and equity valuations, and in some cases bankruptcy and liquidation. 
Enron is perhaps the most dramatic example. Wisely taking advantage of a rapidly deregulating market and capitalizing on its deep knowledge of the industry, Enron had seized a powerful, but probably once-in-a-lifetime, opportunity to remake itself as a market maker in natural gas and energy.
Wall Street responded to this and other genuine innovations with a series of positive reports and ever-higher valuations, eventually labeling Enron one of the best companies in the economy and comparing it to Microsoft and General Electric. However, the aggressive targets that Wall Street set for Enron's shares made the company a captive of its own success. 
Enron's peak valuation of $68 billion in August 2001 required the company to grow its free cash flow at 91% annually for the next six years, and then to grow at the average rate for the economy. One analyst blithely predicted that Enron would come to dominate the wholesale energy market for electricity, natural gas, coal, energy derivatives, bandwidth and energy services on three continents. 
Enron, to its own detriment, decided to take up the challenge. In seeking to meet expectations it expanded into markets in which it had no specific assets, expertise or experience, like broadband and even weather hedging -- and when this failed to deliver enough growth, it manipulated the information it gave to Wall Street. 
The story of Nortel is similar. In 1997 Nortel CEO John Roth launched a strategy to transform the company from one dependent on voice switching into one focused on data networking. Nortel acquired 19 companies between 1997 and early 2001. As its stock price soared, reaching a total capital value of $277 billion in July 2000, it came under pressure to do deals to satisfy the analysts' growth expectations. The more it did, the more it was expected to do. Ultimately, it paid over $32 billion -- using its own overvalued stock as currency -- for these companies, most of which eventually had to be sold off. Its stock has fallen by more than 99% from its peak. Some question whether the company will survive. 
It didn't have to be this way for either company. A few CEOs have wisely and bravely decided to put an end to the expectations game by simply saying no to what has euphemistically been termed earnings ""guidance."" In a recent filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Barry Diller, chairman of USA Networks, balked at the sophisticated art form known as managing expectations, comparing it to a Kabuki dance and saying publicly what many others have said privately: The process has little to do with running a business and the numbers can become distractingly and dangerously detached from fundamentals. 
Indeed, an overvalued stock can be as damaging to the long-run health of a company as an undervalued stock. The words of Warren Buffett in his 1988 letter to shareholders are instructive on this point: ""We do not want to maximize the price at which Berkshire shares trade. . . . We wish for them to trade in a narrow range centered at intrinsic business value."" 
But in order for a stock to trade close to its intrinsic value managers must work to make their organizations far more transparent to investors. Mr. Diller has chosen to provide for analysts actual business budgets broken down by business segments. While it is still too early to tell how that will work, at the very least companies should state their strategies clearly, identify associated value drivers, and report auditable metrics on both. That must include addressing the ""unexplained"" part of their firm's share price -- that part not directly linked to observable cash flows -- through a coherent description of the growth opportunities they foresee. They must tell the markets frankly when they see their stock price as overvalued. 
Stock prices are not simply abstract numbers. The price that Wall Street puts on a company's securities increasingly affects the nature of the strategies that firm adopts and, hence, its prospects for success. Stock prices also drive a company's cost of capital, its borrowing ability, and its ability to make acquisitions. A valuation that becomes unhinged from the underlying realities of the business can rob investors of savings, cost people far more innocent than senior management their jobs, and undermine the viability of suppliers and communities. 
In the long run, conforming to market pressures for impossible growth leads to shortened careers, humiliation and damaged companies. Just ask the folks at Enron, whose once-valuable company and pension fund are now in ruins.

Missed Signals: Stock Gurus Write Off Most Big Write-Offs, But They Shouldn't --- `Special' or `Unusual' Charges Often Hold Vital Clues To Companies' Prospects --- At Home's Future Foretold
By Jonathan Weil and Steve Liesman
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Conventional wisdom among Wall Street stock analysts holds that investors should ignore large write-offs because they provide little insight about future performance. Now, amid the biggest wave of write-offs in history and mounting bankruptcies, it may be time to revisit that wisdom. 
Consider recent events at Bethlehem Steel Corp. In July, it reported a $1.13 billion second-quarter loss, the bulk of it a $1 billion ""unusual noncash"" charge against earnings to write off the value of a deferred tax asset.
The charge didn't bother Salomon Smith Barney analyst Michelle Galanter Applebaum. It ""masked what was essentially an improved quarter,"" she wrote on July 25, retaining her buy recommendation on the stock and predicting it would more than triple. 
Three months later, Bethlehem filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. 
Far from being something investors could safely ignore, Bethlehem's write-off of deferred tax assets -- mainly deductible losses carried forward from prior years -- held a clue to its future. Such assets can be used to offset future income-tax bills. But, of course, they can be used only by companies that are profitable and paying income taxes. By taking the charge, Bethlehem was signaling that it wasn't likely to use the assets, because it probably wouldn't have taxable profits anytime soon. 
Almost any kind of write-off can send a message about the soundness of a business, the competence of its management or its prospects for growth. Although Wall Street stock analysts and financial executives routinely tell investors to disregard these entries, others say they're among the things investors should most closely heed. 
""When you see these large write-downs, the antenna should go up immediately, and you should start digging for the underlying business reasons for these losses,"" says Lynn Turner, an accounting professor at Colorado State University and a former chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The sheer size of recent write-offs has made understanding their nature more urgent. Companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have reported more than $165 billion of so-called unusual charges so far this year, says research firm Multex.com Inc., more than in the prior five years combined. Meanwhile, Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings by publicly traded companies through mid-December hit a record 241, compared with 176 all of last year, according to New Generation Research Inc. in Boston. 
Even if bankruptcy seems like a remote prospect, an ""unusual"" charge against earnings -- often called a ""special,"" ""one-time"" or ""nonrecurring"" charge -- can provide an exit signal to investors. While stocks sometimes rally on news of such a charge, as a company announces a bold housecleaning move, the rally often doesn't last. A study by Multex.com and The Wall Street Journal found that companies taking the largest unusual charges as a percentage of sales have substantially poorer stock returns in the three months following the announcement of the charge than companies with minimal or no such charges. 
The study, covering the past six years, looked at stocks of all public companies with market capitalizations of $1 billion or more. It divided those that took unusual charges into 10 groups, from the smallest to the largest such charges as a percentage of revenue. Stocks of companies with the largest charges relative to sales had a median decline of 9.4% in the 90 days after the charge was taken. Stocks of companies with the smallest charges relative to sales had a median gain of 1.48%. 
While it could be argued that the shares might have fared worse without the charges, Marc Gerstein, director of investment research at Multex.com, says the study shows that ""if you want to weed out stocks to look at for investment purposes, companies with unusually large write-offs are a good place to start."" 
Sometimes the significance of special charges isn't immediately clear. But some investors grow suspicious anyway, on the ""cockroach theory"": Where there's one problem, there probably are more. ""From seemingly minor or immaterial charges, sometimes investors can glean insight into how a company either correctly or incorrectly accounts for its business and whether a company is pushing the envelope,"" says James Chanos, president of Kynikos Associates, a firm that specializes in short-selling, or betting on stock declines. 
Many short-sellers raised their bearish bets on Enron Corp. in mid-October after it took a $1.01 billion charge largely to write down the value of soured investments. Inside the charge was a $35 million write-off of investment losses at a partnership controlled by the company's chief financial officer. Later revelations about that and other partnerships, which weren't consolidated into the Houston-based energy concern's financial statements, led the market to lose faith in the company's finances. Its stock now trades for under a dollar a share as the company seeks to restructure under bankruptcy law. 
The significance of special charges -- whether they represent old baggage from the past or illuminate the future -- is at the center of a lively debate under way in the accounting world. One side holds that generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, provide the best available snapshot of a company's financial position. GAAP, which companies must use in their official financial statements, requires that nearly all charges be treated as ordinary expenses. 
Others, including many stock analysts, contend the best view comes from ""pro forma"" financial results -- calculated ""as if"" many expenses didn't really exist. The idea is that these expenses aren't relevant to future performance. 
Companies increasingly highlight the pro forma view in news releases they generally put out before their official filings with regulators. But pro forma calculations adhere to no particular standard. Companies essentially do what they want. Now, accountants and economists say the practice of excluding blemishes is so widespread that companies and analysts often guide investors to dismiss charges that contain prescient warnings -- like the one at Bethlehem Steel. 
Ms. Applebaum, the Salomon Smith Barney analyst who played down Bethlehem's big write-off, explains that she has covered other steel companies that returned to profitability shortly after writing off deferred tax assets. She thought Bethlehem would do the same. She notes that GAAP rules on such assets obliged Bethlehem to follow strict criteria in assessing its chances of future profitability -- stricter criteria than stock analysts typically use. 
As for Bethlehem, Chief Financial Officer Leonard M. Anthony says the charge the company took was to some extent ""predictive of the future."" 
GAAP also has well-established standards for writing down other kinds of assets. Companies must reduce the value on their books of anything from a customer loan to a manufacturing plant when its worth has diminished. Again, Wall Street stock analysts tend to dismiss the resulting charges as one-time events. 
Sometimes that makes sense. During the 1981-82 recession, restructuring was a part of many corporations' strategies. They took charges for streamlining, outsourcing and otherwise shedding costs to position themselves for recovery. Because the resulting earnings volatility made it hard to compare companies' growth rates or price-earnings ratios, and because the charges weren't expected to recur, there was logic to excluding them to come up with ""smoothed"" earnings trends. 
""Investors came to look upon the charges, correctly in many cases, as evidence that those firms had recognized past mistakes and had made tough decisions to become more efficient,"" said a September 2001 study by the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. 
But the practice soon got out of hand. Some companies became habitual restructurers. The Levy study estimates that ""operating earnings"" -- another term for pro forma earnings -- at companies in the S&P 500 index have outstripped net income by more than 10% annually on average over the past two decades, and by as much as 20% annually in recent years. One reason: While companies readily exclude all sorts of special losses from their operating earnings, they are far less likely to exclude one-time gains, such as profits from asset sales. 
Investors ignore write-offs at their peril, says economist David Levy at the institute. The reason is that when a company writes down an asset, it usually has concluded the asset won't generate as much cash as once assumed. That suggests the company as a whole won't, either. ""The write-down of an asset is a recognition . . . that the future is not going to be as profitable as expected,"" Mr. Levy says. 
And if the company borrowed to buy the assets it is writing down, it could find itself squeezed by debt, as At Home Corp. was. At the start of 2001, the provider of high-speed Internet access, which did business as Excite@Home, announced a $5.43 billion net loss for the 2000 fourth quarter, on just $169.1 million in revenue. Much of the loss -- $4.63 billion -- reflected write-downs of ""goodwill,"" the intangible asset created when one company pays a premium to buy another. 
One such write-down concerned At Home's purchase of Bluemountain.com, an online greeting-card service. At Home paid $1 billion in stock and cash for the company in late 1999, taking on $350 million of debt to do so. But Bluemountain had little revenue. A year later, At Home took a $684.2 million charge for the goodwill it created by buying Bluemountain at a price far above its net worth. 
Rather than its $5.43 billion net loss, At Home highlighted its self-defined ""net operating loss"" for the 2000 fourth quarter -- a mere $36 million. At Home Chairman George Bell said in a conference call that the charges had ""no direct impact"" on the company's operating performance. 
Most stock analysts following the stock seemed to agree. Bank of America Securities' Douglas Shapiro, in a report following At Home's news release, didn't even mention the gigantic charge or net loss. ""With the worst case already largely discounted into the stock, we retain our Buy rating and year-end 2001 $20 price target,"" Mr. Shapiro wrote on Jan. 26, 2001, when At Home stock stood at $6.47. 
At Dain Rauscher Wessels, senior analyst David Lee Smith also ignored the net loss in his commentary after At Home's earnings news release. He retained his buy rating, although he lowered his price target to $15 from $38. The company ""has a long-term asset base and is appropriately valued for long-term investors,"" Mr. Smith wrote when the charge was announced. 
But some investors voted with their feet. At Home's stock sank about 32% in the following two weeks. Even though At Home was writing down Bluemountain, it still had to pay for it. Faced with growing cash needs for interest payments and service upgrades, At Home filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September. Its stock was last quoted at a penny. 
Looking back, Mr. Smith says At Home's huge write-off was a ""perfect example"" of a charge overlooked by himself and other stock analysts that would have helped predict the company's future performance. ""Probably too frequently we have given companies the benefit of the doubt without burrowing in and asking, `What does it say about the financial condition of the company?' "" says Mr. Smith, whose firm is now called RBC Dain Rauscher Inc. 
At Bank of America, Mr. Shapiro says he felt At Home's stock price already reflected how little value there was in its media businesses such as Bluemountain and the Excite Web portal. He felt cash flow from At Home's stronger business, a network for cable companies to deliver Internet access, would be sufficient -- and if it wasn't, he figured the cable companies would put up the cash to save At Home. ""I was wrong about my assumptions about the fundamentals of At Home's business. But I don't think the implications of the charge itself were that significant,"" Mr. Shapiro says. At Home says that the actions it took ""were in accordance with general accounting principles."" 
Companies frequently portray charges as part of a broader restructuring effort to restore profitability. But at Lucent Technologies Inc., they signaled a business plan that had failed and a management team that was struggling to find a remedy. 
The telecom-equipment maker told investors in late 2000 it would drive out $1 billion of costs and take other unspecified charges over the coming months. On Jan. 24, 2001, with the stock at about $19, Lucent forecast that the charge would range from $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. But in April, Lucent announced $2.7 billion in ""one-time"" charges for the just-ended quarter. 
Its news release -- excluding the charges and adjusting for the spin-off of some businesses -- highlighted pro forma results, which showed the loss narrowing to $1.26 billion from $1.31 billion in the immediately preceding quarter. ""Lucent delivered much improved performance in the quarter, despite continued softness in several key markets world-wide,"" said Chairman Henry Schacht. 
Results as tabulated according to GAAP pointed to a different trend. Lucent's loss from continuing operations widened to $3.38 billion from $1.58 billion in the preceding quarter. 
And the write-offs kept coming. In all, Lucent recorded $11.42 billion of ""restructuring and one-time charges"" in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. Its stock, which was in the 80s two years ago and in the high teens when Lucent announced the first one-time charges, closed Friday at $6.18. 
Were there clues in Lucent's early charges that might have foretold this future? Lucent's April announcement detailed an amalgam of write-offs and other expenses that showed weakness in many parts of the company's business. 
A charge for layoffs, for instance, showed the company had deployed large numbers of employees in key divisions where it no longer expected profits. 
A write-off for accounts receivable from a significant customer -- Winstar Communications Inc., which filed for Chapter 11 in April -- showed that some past sales had failed to bring in cash and that future sales growth could be hurt because the customer base had shrunk. 
A write-off of goodwill revealed that some acquired assets wouldn't generate the expected profits. Inventory write-downs showed that previous sales projections were too high and future revenue was likely to slip. 
""When you're making cuts that deep, it means the company has fundamental problems,"" says Mr. Turner of Colorado State. That should prompt investors to ask whether ""this is the management team that's going to be able to get you back where you need to be,"" Mr. Turner says, and it also signals ""that there's probably more to come."" Indeed, had investors focused on explanations of the charges contained on page 16 of the quarterly report Lucent filed with regulators in May, they would have learned that the company anticipated taking additional restructuring charges during the year. 
So why the news release's emphasis on the pro forma figure? ""We highlighted it because it's the way many of our competitors provide their earnings,"" says Michelle Davidson, a Lucent spokeswoman, who notes that the GAAP earnings numbers were included in the release. 
Asked whether the charges amounted to a warning of a deteriorating financial position, the company declines to comment. Investors, says Ms. Davidson, should focus on Lucent's progress in delivering on its pledges of reduced capital spending and employment and increased working capital. The current management team has ""dealt with the tough issues head-on, restructured in a tough market and built a solid track record in creating a plan and delivering on a plan,"" she says. 
Sometimes, even what seems clearly to be a one-time charge can flag fundamental problems. Providian Financial Corp., a San Francisco-based credit-card issuer, reported profits soaring at a 37% compounded annual rate from the end of 1995 through 2000. Its stock more than quadrupled to $57.50. 
But Providian's sales tactics came under attack. In mid-2000, Providian said it planned to settle with state and federal regulators over allegations of consumer fraud. Without admitting wrongdoing, it agreed to soften its practices by, among other things, extending late-payment grace periods and toning down telemarketing scripts. Providian recorded a $272.6 million ""one-time"" charge for the 2000 second quarter as a result of the settlement. It posted net income of $62.8 million. 
Many stock analysts treated the charge as positive news. At CIBC World Markets, analyst Steven Eisman wrote on June 20, 2000, that ""for the past year, legal issues concerning the company's sales tactics and back-office processes clouded the stock. By taking a provision for all potential future legal inquiries, we believe the financial risk associated with such legal inquiries is now behind them."" Mr. Eisman has since left CIBC and says his new employer doesn't permit him to comment. 
In contrast to stock analysts' optimism, bond analyst Kathleen Shanley at Gimme Credit, a New York research firm, saw a red flag. Her concern: ""the potential impact of a change in marketing practices on previously sizzling revenue-growth rates."" 
Although Providian said it had already implemented its sales reforms by the time of the settlement, Ms. Shanley doubted their full impact was reflected in the earnings outlook. Besides worrying that Providian wouldn't have the same marketing tools to deploy in its push for customers, she thought the settlements exposed the degree to which growth had been based on loans to people with shaky credit. 
Then, for the first quarter of 2001, Providian reported declining noninterest income and growing credit losses, due to rising bankruptcies and the slowing economy. Alan Elias, vice president of corporate communications, acknowledges that the settlement affected future revenue a little, by applying ""some additional pressure in regards to marketing certain membership products."" 
Mr. Elias says there was nothing about the settlement that spoke to credit quality, even though Providian eventually had ""higher-than-expected loss rates in our low-end portfolio."" He adds: ""To make a direct correlation that this is what is going to happen two years down the road [as a result of the settlement charge] is preposterous."" 
In any case, beset by rising consumer defaults and declining revenue, Providian issued a series of further profit warnings. On Oct. 18, it reported a 71% fall in third-quarter earnings, knocking the stock down 58% in a day. The stock closed Friday at $3.55, down 94% for the year.

Politics & Policy
Enron Debacle Will Test Leadership of SEC's New Chief --- Harvey Pitt's Handling of Energy-Trading Firm's Collapse to Be Watched Closely
By Michael Schroeder

WASHINGTON -- Harvey Pitt's mission since becoming Securities and Exchange Commission chairman in August has been to ease the tough-enforcement policies of predecessor Arthur Levitt. Now comes the notorious case of the Enron Corp. debacle. 
More than ever, leaders of industry, labor and politics will be watching -- many skeptically -- how the new Pitt SEC will perform. Mr. Levitt specialized in rooting out accounting fraud; Mr. Pitt, a former securities lawyer whose clients included all ""Big Five"" accounting companies and major corporations, has said he wants the regulatory agency to be less adversarial.
The rhetoric played well enough -- until Enron's implosion punched big holes in investors' portfolios, and leveled many employees' retirement savings. The scrutiny the SEC will come under for its own scrutiny of Enron was evident Friday: Aides to Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, said he will soon hold hearings on Enron. 
Democrats have been itching for Mr. Lieberman to do so, believing the revelations could embarrass Republicans who have benefited from Enron's past political largesse -- and in particular President Bush, whose political ties to Enron and Chairman Kenneth Lay date to his first election as Texas governor. 
But Mr. Bush, who named Mr. Pitt to the SEC, also on Friday indicated he wants no slack cut for the giant Houston energy-trading concern. 
""I think it's very important to understand what took place,"" he told reporters at his Texas ranch. ""The SEC will be looking into matters, Congress appears to be looking into matters. There will be a lot of government inquiry into Enron and what took place there,"" he added. ""I'm deeply concerned about the citizens of Houston who worked for Enron who lost life savings."" 
Broadly speaking, Mr. Pitt is resolute about his regulatory approach. Rep. John Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who has made a career of riding herd on regulators he deems soft, recently wrote Mr. Pitt to blast him for ""repudiating"" the Levitt legacy, and to demand a tough investigation of Enron, which filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code earlier this month. Mr. Pitt replied that he was ""perplexed"" by Mr. Dingell's assertions; as he sees it, in fact, the Levitt commission's ""adversarial attitude toward industry and professions in almost all respects"" sowed the seeds of the Enron mess. 
Although Mr. Levitt earned a fortune as a Wall Street executive and chairman of the American Stock Exchange, in eight years as SEC chief he pushed a number of small-investor initiatives that rankled the financial-services industry. 
Mr. Pitt comes to the job after more than two decades as a securities lawyer representing, among others, infamous inside-trader Ivan Boesky. Mr. Pitt had worked for the SEC early in his career in the 1970s, serving as its general counsel before joining the Washington office of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. 
What has raised red flags is Mr. Pitt's policy that the SEC will consider a company's cooperation and self-policing efforts in deciding penalties -- or whether to bring an enforcement case at all. In some unusual public criticism, Lynn Turner, former chief accountant under Mr. Levitt, said in an interview in late October that a company's senior management could in effect shift blame for securities violations to lower-level employees. 
Through a spokesman, Mr. Pitt declined an interview, but referred to recent speeches in which he complimented Mr. Levitt and disputed his critics. ""Those who are counting on a lack of aggressiveness on our part to police improper market activities will be sorely disappointed,"" he told the Consumer Federation of America last month. 
Former SEC officials say that, as a practical matter, SEC enforcement attorneys are independent and wouldn't buckle to a commissioner's pressure to back off a probe of possible wrongdoing. Meantime, in answer to his skeptics, Mr. Pitt is expected to showcase two coming enforcement cases, against as-yet-unnamed companies. 
He said one case involves the use of ""pro forma earnings"" in a way that misled investors and broke accounting rules, while the other case alleges a violation of ""Regulation FD."" That Regulation Fair Disclosure is a Levitt SEC rule, strongly opposed on Wall Street, intended to ensure that important corporate information is available to individuals at the same time as it is to professional investors. 
Mr. Pitt also has endorsed some Levitt initiatives, and he has tried to go beyond Regulation FD in making corporate information available in a more broadly and timely way, by proposing a new system for companies' disclosure of market-moving news as events occur, rather than quarterly. 
But the Enron case offers the most visible opportunity for defining Mr. Pitt as an enforcer. He has made it a high priority, assigning a team of about six attorneys and accountants to unravel the company's complicated books, according to a person familiar with the probe. He pesters probers for regular progress reports, and even questions investigation strategy at times, according to this person. 
Mr. Pitt has said he intends to make Enron an example of his push for ""real time"" enforcement, to speed up the slow pace of some SEC investigations. But Gregory Bruch, a former SEC enforcement attorney, says Enron's involvement with partnerships and extensive energy-derivatives trading probably would take a year for the SEC to unravel. The SEC would have to ""cut corners"" to bring a case more quickly, perhaps naming fewer defendants than it otherwise might. 
Mr. Pitt declines to comment on specifics of the Enron case, except to say ""the public can be confident . . . that we will deal with any wrongdoing and wrongdoers swiftly and completely."" 
Yet even as Mr. Pitt stands to be judged for the SEC's handling of the Enron matter, the case holds particular complications for him that will restrict the chairman's own role. If the commission staff ultimately does recommend filing an enforcement action against Enron, Mr. Pitt must recuse himself at that point because a former client, Arthur Andersen LLP, also is under SEC investigation for its role as Enron's auditor. 
Mr. Pitt is required by SEC rules to recuse himself for at least a year from matters involving his former law firm or clients. He has already done so on several involving Big Five accounting firms, including an enforcement case involving a foreign affiliate of KPMG International in September. 
The possibility of his recusal in an Enron case adds to the pressure on the White House to fill four openings on the five-member commission. On Dec. 20, the administration announced plans to nominate two Republican accounting-firm executives: Paul Atkins, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, and Cynthia Glassman, a principle at Ernst & Young LLP. But the Senate isn't likely to confirm them until Mr. Bush has nominees for the two other seats designated for Democrats. Without new commissioners, a decision on an Enron enforcement action would be left to the lone current commissioner besides Mr. Pitt -- Republican Laura Unger, who is serving under an expired term. 
Meantime, Mr. Pitt has been trying to mend fences with critics. At Mr. Pitt's request, he went to Capitol Hill to meet with Mr. Dingell on Dec. 12. Mr. Pitt ""wants to be judged on what he does rather than what he's said in the past,"" recalls Mr. Dingell about that meeting, adding: ""I think that's a wise choice."" 
--- Chairman Pitt vs. Ex-Chairman Levitt

The rhetoric of the current chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission differs sharply from his predecessor's.

Heard on the Street
How to Spot Signs of Companies' Distress
By Henny Sender

On Friday, Nov. 30, two days before Enron filed for bankruptcy-court protection, its shares were trading at 26 cents -- down from a high of $90 and a little late for investors to decide to ditch the stock. Ditto for investors in any number of other big corporate casualties this fall, including Bethlehem Steel, Federal-Mogul and Polaroid. 
But astute investors realize there are some early-warning signals that work better than plunging stock prices to tell them to head for the exits. And as more companies seek protection from U.S. Bankruptcy Court, predicting whether a company may file becomes an ever-more-relevant skill.
The stakes are higher than they used to be in reading the market equivalent of tea leaves. First, the number of bankruptcy filings is up sharply this year, and many experts believe more are to come in the current unsettled economic climate. Chapter-11 bankruptcy filings by publicly traded companies hit a record 143 this year, affecting $76 billion of debt, compared with 119 the previous year on $30 billion of debt, according to David Hamilton, a specialist on defaults for Moody's Investors Service in New York. 
Moreover, many companies that file for bankruptcy protection nowadays are more likely to end up in liquidation than in the past, analysts say, making the stock of a distressed company less likely to be worth much. It isn't only New Age telecommunications companies -- becoming famous for the plummeting values of their fiber-optic networks and other assets -- that may be valued less in bankruptcy court than their shareholders hoped. The same may prove true for retailers now in Chapter 11 proceedings, restructuring advisers warn. 
Here is a guide to a half-dozen barometers of financial health watched by sophisticated investors for signs of potential bankruptcy, some are easier than others for average investors to follow on their own: 

SWAPS THAT SWEAT IT OUT: The derivatives markets can be especially valuable as an early-warning signal -- particularly the credit-default swap market, where institutional investors seek financial protection against corporate bankruptcies. The default swap market is probably the most sensitive measure of how market participants view corporate prospects. 
For example, the credit-derivatives market was far ahead of the rating agencies in suggesting that once-mighty energy trader Enron was a weak credit. Weeks before the Houston company sought bankruptcy-court protection, pricing on Enron protection was far more expensive than it should have been, given Enron's then investment-grade rating. Essentially, these credit swaps are a form of insurance on Enron debt; if Enron defaults, the buyer of such a swap goes to the seller of the swap and receives 100 cents on the dollar, regardless of how worthless the debt may have become. 
In September, shortly after Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling stepped down, there was a drastic increase in Enron credit-default swap volumes, and spreads doubled on Enron risk to a steep 2.75 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered Rate, the short-term rate off which banks price some loans. 
By October, with the announcement that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating Enron's financial statements for accounting irregularities, spreads doubled again, to more than five percentage points. Then, after Enron lost access to the commercial-paper market, spreads rose to an almost prohibitively expensive 15 percentage points, according to data from KMV LLC, a credit-risk-management service in San Francisco. Meanwhile, the shares edged down to $13 from $37 during the course of the month, levels that didn't hint at the fate that would overtake Enron just a few weeks later. Indeed, the shares didn't drop below $1 until Nov. 28, from above $4 on Nov. 27. 
(Unfortunately, there isn't a market for many corporate names below investment grade, unless, like Enron, they plunge rapidly into junk territory.) 

DEBT THAT DIVES IN VALUE: Often the secondary bond market can provide valuable clues about a troubled company's fate, as bond analysts are much more focused on a company's ability to repay its debts. They scour information pertinent to the sort of distress that leads to a filing. 
Henry Miller, vice chairman of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, an investment-banking and advisory boutique, has worked out a formula as follows. ""When the bonds start trading between 90 cents and 80 cents on the dollar, a light bulb goes on,"" he says. ""When the bonds then fall to between 60 cents and 80 cents, that tells you that somebody is nervous. And when they start trading between 40 cents and 60 cents, it is a question of when, not whether. And when they go below 40 cents, a filing is -- to varying degrees -- imminent."" 

BANKING ON TROUBLE: Another indication that a company may be about to seek bankruptcy-court protection is when it draws down all its credit or standby credit lines from its bankers, according to Brad Eric Scheler, head of the restructuring practice for law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson in New York. Such drawdowns are also an early-warning symptom that a company anticipates a turn for the worse in its fortunes. 

CONSCIOUSNESS OF RATIOS: Financial distress quickly translates into a company violating its lending agreements with its bankers. Such violations allow the banks to pull their lending lines or even declare a company in default. While information about the relationship between bank and client usually isn't public, there are certain relevant financial ratios that can provide clues. For example, lending agreements oblige most companies across a wide range of industries to keep the debt level at no more than about seven or eight times earnings before interest payments, taxes and depreciation. If the amount of the debt is far greater, investors can assume the banks aren't happy. Unhappy bankers can even petition the courts to push their client into involuntary bankruptcy. 

A DATE WITH DEBTHOLDERS: Figuring out the timing of a filing can be tricky, of course. One indicator watched by many hedge funds: whether a potential Chapter 11 candidate has an onerous interest payment coming up. Managers of these sophisticated investment pools assume that a troubled company would prefer to file before, rather than after, paying out large sums of precious cash. 
But that may not be a sure thing. For example, in advance of a scheduled payment on Global Crossing bonds in November, many hedge funds made bearish bets on the telecommunications company, which already had drawn down bank lines, anticipating it soon would be in violation of its bank covenants and would seek bankruptcy protection. The company, though, met the cash call, and the hedge funds closed out their losing positions. On Friday, Global Crossing announced it had come to agreement with its bankers on loan covenants. 

FLASHING RED LIGHT: Some signals couldn't be more glaring. If a company retains bankruptcy counsel or calls in restructuring-advisory boutiques, such as Greenhill & Co. or Blackstone Group or Lazard Freres & Co., it is reasonably certain a company is at least considering bankruptcy. (Another reason for some hedge funds' bearishness on Global Crossing: It has hired a restructuring adviser, according to people familiar with the matter; it won't comment on the matter, saying its relationships with any advisers are confidential.) 
One of the messages that restructuring advisers tell their clients is to file early. That means investors can be caught off guard more easily since some recent bankruptcy-court filers, such as Covad Communications Group, have had significant amounts of cash on their balance sheets.

Investors Forecast Unreal 401(k) Gains Savings: Study finds near-term expectations subdued, but long-term projections of returns overly optimistic.

Two straight years of stock market losses have left America's 401(k) retirement savers with muted expectations for 2002, but in many cases their longer-term forecasts remain wildly optimistic, according to a new survey. 
The November poll of 500 participants in 401(k) plans, to be released this week by No. 2 mutual fund provider Vanguard Group, found that respondents expect an average 7% annual return on stocks over the next year or two. It's the first time a national survey has found 401(k) investors expecting less than double-digit returns on their accounts, according to Vanguard.
But many savers still have a rosy long-term view of the market, the poll found. Nearly one-fourth of respondents expect stock prices to rise 30% to 100% a year over the next two decades--in line with the results of public-opinion surveys from the height of the late-1990s bull market. Even the respondents' median forecast of 15% annual gains is well above historical stock market returns, which have averaged 10.7% a year since 1926. (Median means half the forecasts were higher and half were lower.) 
Experts say the optimistic responses indicate that, for some investors, the euphoria of the bull market that crashed in the spring of 2000 still lingers. 
""There's some recognition of how tough the current market environment has been,"" said Barbara Fallon-Walsh, a Vanguard principal who oversees the firm's 401(k) education programs. ""But longer term, it might be that hope springs eternal."" 
Still, she said she was encouraged by investors' ""reasonable"" near-term expectations, by the fact that most savers have stayed the course in a rough environment for stocks and that many recognize the need to save more money to meet their goals. 
Only 15% of respondents reported making a 401(k) portfolio change in the last six months. Twenty-two percent said they intend to contribute a higher portion of pay in the next six months, compared with 12% who raised their savings rate in the previous six months. 
When it comes to long-term expectations for stock prices, several prominent professional investors have issued far tamer forecasts than those recorded by Vanguard's pollsters. 
Billionaire Warren Buffett, for example, said investors should be happy with 7% to 8% annual returns over the next decade. New York-based Standard & Poor's Corp. predicts returns of 6% to 7% a year over the next five to 10 years, and Roger Ibbotson, head of Chicago investment research firm Ibbotson Associates, expects gains averaging 9.4% over the next 20 years. 
That's a far cry from the 20%-plus annual gains investors came to expect during the 1990s. The pros cite several reasons for their conservative expectations, including the fact that stocks are still pricey by historical standards. 
Vanguard's survey also found that investors' expectations for bonds and money market funds are modest for the near term, but unrealistically buoyant over the long haul. Respondents expect annual returns of 7% for bonds and 4% for ultra-safe money markets over the next year or two--close to historical averages. But over the next decade or two, the median forecast is for 10% annual gains for both asset classes, while the average forecast, skewed by the extreme optimists, calls for 15% returns for bonds and 16% for money markets. 
So-called defined contribution retirement plans, including 401(k)s, allow workers to save for retirement by investing tax-deferred income through a menu of investment options that typically includes stock and bond mutual funds, their employer's company stock and a money market fund. More than 40 million Americans take part in the plans. 
The hazards of owning company stock in a 401(k) account is poorly understood, according to Vanguard's analysis. Respondents rated company stock as less risky than stock mutual funds, which experts consider much safer because of their diversified holdings. But respondents correctly identified individual stock in general as riskier than stock funds. 
""There are analogies in other areas, such as people's [often negative] perceptions of stock brokers and politicians,"" Fallon-Walsh said. ""It's the attitude that 'mine is different.' It's the comfort of the known."" 
Thousands of 401(k) savers at companies such as Enron Corp. and Lucent Technologies Inc. have seen their retirement savings crumble in the last two years because they invested too much in company stock. Many financial planners say workers shouldn't put more than 5% of their 401(k) holdings in their employer's stock, especially since their paycheck is also tied to the company's fortunes. 
The unrealistic long-term expectations of many, and the misperceptions of relative risk, point to the importance of 401(k) education programs, Fallon-Walsh said. 
""Between all the Web sites, company meetings with employees and the printed materials available, the table is set. It's just a question of getting people to sit down and eat the dinner.""

Executives' Bonuses Stir Anger as Polaroid Sinks
JUSTIN POPE
ASSOCIATED PRESS

BOSTON -- In 1996, when Gary DiCamillo joined Polaroid Corp. as chief executive, the company had 10,000 employees and its stock was trading at more than $40 a share. Five years later, Polaroid is in bankruptcy proceedings, thousands have been laid off, and its shares trade for pennies each. 
But even as former workers scrounge for medical coverage, DiCamillo, who was paid nearly $850,000 last year, stands to earn up to twice that in bonus pay under a plan Polaroid has asked a U.S. Bankruptcy Court to approve.
The justification? Polaroid said it must pay millions to 45 top executives to make sure they don't jump the sinking ship before they can use their expertise to disassemble the company and pay off creditors. Some of the payments would be tied to how well the sales go, but others would be guaranteed. 
The plan has angered some former Polaroid workers, many of whom never got severance pay and lost thousands of dollars in an employee stock plan. 
""[DiCamillo is] looking after his cronies at the top and he forgot about the people that have been there for years,"" said Noel Barry of Bellingham, Mass., a former employee who is on long-term disability and recently received word that Polaroid no longer will contribute to his insurance. 
These payments to executives, known as retention bonuses, are common in bankruptcy cases, and often creditors say it is money well spent--smart employees are as essential in bad times as in good. 
""It's not a crazy idea,"" said Alan Johnson, managing director of the executive compensation firm Johnson & Associates, who has testified for companies seeking approval for retention bonuses. ""It's almost a necessity. The question is to whom and how much."" 
Others say the ensuing bad publicity can outweigh the benefits. 
""From just a perceptual point of view, it certainly seems not to pass the ethical stink test,"" said W. Michael Hoffman, executive director for the Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass. 
Generally, such arrangements mix guaranteed payments with incentives based on how long employees stay and how successful they are in selling assets. 
At Houston-based Enron Corp., nearly 600 employees received more than $100 million in bonuses last month as the company faced a merger that unraveled and then filed for Chapter 11. 
Boston bankruptcy lawyer Paul Daley said such payment proposals are increasingly common. 
""When I started 30 years ago, when someone filed a Chapter 11, one of the things you recommended was they take a cut in salary,"" Daley said. ""Now the fear is always that executives without the bonuses would leave and would spend their time looking for their next job rather than concentrating on the needs of the company."" 
Polaroid retirees ridicule such arguments. With a weak economy and Polaroid's reputation in tatters, they doubt recruiters are actively wooing the company's top executives. 
""Maybe they're right, these 45 people are essential to the reconstruction of the company, and if so, obviously shareholders ought to applaud such a move,"" Hoffman said. ""I guess it's possible, but it does raise not only factual eyebrows but ethical eyebrows."" 
Company spokesman Skip Colcord said: ""This is an incentive to get key people with key skill sets to remain with the company through the Chapter 11 process."" 
In considering retention bonuses, bankruptcy judges must determine whether the plans show proper business judgment. Among the factors considered are whether the employees are to blame for the bankruptcy and how likely they are to leave. 
Bill Coleman, vice president of compensation at Salary.com, a Wellesley, Mass.-based executive compensation firm, said the bonus plans are feeding on one another: Each time a plan is approved, it serves as justification for others. 
But scrutiny also is on the rise, because so many more Americans are invested in the markets than during the last recession. 
""When you have employees losing their pensions or locked out of selling stock when executives weren't, or kept out of their severance while the CEO is getting one,"" Coleman said, ""those kinds of patterns create huge negative feelings toward the company.""

Fewer Power Plants Slated; Worries Rise Energy: Electricity producers' spending cuts lead to a slowdown in construction, which may mean tight supplies as the U.S. recovers from recession.

HOUSTON -- Electricity producers' plans to curtail expansion, aimed at reassuring investors rattled by Enron Corp.'s collapse, are raising concerns that the U.S. may face power shortages in the next few years. 
Mirant Corp., NRG Energy Inc. and some rival generators shelved or postponed billions of dollars in projects this month to bolster their credit ratings after downgrades helped push Enron into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
A decline in electricity prices has further reduced the incentive to build plants. The slowdown in construction may lead to tight power supplies as the U.S. economy recovers from recession, possibly next year, and energy demand picks up, investors and analysts say. 
""When the economy snaps back, we're going to have howls again asking, 'Why didn't we build more power plants?'"" said Donald Coxe, manager of the $352-million Harris Insight Equity Fund. ""In 12 months people will once again be predicting an energy crisis and asking why we were so stupid not to build more."" 
Enron filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors Dec. 2 after investors grew concerned that the company, formerly the largest energy trader, was hiding debt at affiliated partnerships. Customers defected as the company's credit rating was cut to junk status and it couldn't raise cash needed to back trades. 
To avert similar downgrades, Atlanta-based Mirant is slashing capital spending by 40% and Minneapolis-based NRG is delaying $900million in spending on generators. Dynegy Inc., based in Houston, will spend less than $1.5 billion on projects, down from a budgeted $1.7 billion. 
""The last thing the market wants to see is a huge expansion program that requires huge cash flow,"" said Jeffrey Gildersleeve, an Argus Research analyst. ""Management is going ahead with what's on the table now. The later stuff is being delayed."" 
Shares of power traders and producers have fallen as investors fearful of an Enron-like meltdown shy away from debt-laden companies. In the last two months, Mirant shares have slid 43%, Calpine 36%, Dynegy 34% and NRG 14%. 
Gildersleeve projected about six months ago that about 320,000 megawatts of generating capacity would be built in the U.S. in the next five years. He now expects 150,000 to 200,000 megawatts. 
At least 185,000 megawatts must be added by 2010 to meet U.S. demand, the Department of Energy forecasts. A megawatt is enough power for about 1,000 typical U.S. homes. 
The deregulation of electricity markets in the U.S., first in New England and later in the Middle Atlantic states, California and parts of the Midwest, spurred developers such as Calpine and utilities such as Dominion Resources Inc. to break ground on new power plants in the last few years. 
Calpine, based in San Jose, added eight plants in the third quarter, quadrupling revenue in the period to $2.92 billion. Duke Energy Corp., the biggest U.S. utility owner, boosted third-quarter net income by 50% to $796 million as power sales rose. 
Profit from electricity sales is falling as the U.S. economy slows, in part because of caps imposed by federal regulators in the West to stem soaring prices that drove California's two biggest utilities to the brink of insolvency. 
This quarter, electricity prices at the California and Oregon border dropped to an average of $26.91 a megawatt, down 89% from $244.80 a year earlier. 
Calpine said it is now reviewing the company's plan to increase generating capacity to 70,000 megawatts by the end of 2005, a level that would make it the nation's biggest electricity producer. 
Even with the cutbacks, many energy company executives and analysts say they aren't worried about shortages. The industry will build plants where needs arise, they say. The western U.S. has added about 5,000 megawatts of capacity this year, an increase of 3%, with almost half coming in California. 
""If the players still see a need for power, the plants will get built,"" said Thomas Capps, chief executive of Dominion, owner of Virginia's largest utility. 
A lack of transmission lines is more likely to lead to shortages than would a dearth of power plants, said David Schanzer, a utility analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott. In some cities, such as New York and Boston, power lines can get overloaded, leading to blackouts during a heat wave.

California
Commentary UC Fund Managers Were Asleep at the Enron Wheel
PETER NAVARRO

12/31/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
B-11
Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

The University of California is suing Enron to recover the $145 million it lost investing in the company's fallen stock. Methinks the lawyers got it wrong. Instead, folks like me--a UC professor and one of thousands of future pensioners--should be suing the university's portfolio managers. 
These ""motley fools"" apparently spent over a year riding a $90 stock all the way down toward 90 cents. This is a clear violation of the first three rules of modern investing: (1) cut your losses, (2) cut your losses and (3) cut your losses.
Maybe, with more than $50 billion of assets to track, UC's portfolio managers simply weren't paying attention when Enron began to circle around the Wall Street drain. More likely, these market un-wizards succumbed to the antiquated mind-set of traditional ""buy and hold"" investing. 
In the buy-and-hold investor's passive little world, the stock market is a ""random walk"" where stocks go up and down, but no one can predict the movements. So managers should buy stocks that broadly diversify one's portfolio and hang on for the ride. The problem with this theory is that Enron's meltdown was anything but random. 
Any prudent portfolio manager watching the stock could have seen the early-warning signs months ago. Fully one-third of Enron's business was in telecommunications--not energy. Like other telecom companies, Enron over- invested and wound up with a crushing debt when the sector collapsed. 
Add huge cost overruns on some projects in India and you have a certain recipe for the stock's long decline. 
The coup de grace came when word leaked of alleged accounting improprieties--the focus of UC's class-action suit. Yet this fraud came to light long after Enron had completed most of its collapse. 
Which leads me back to the original point. The stock took more than a year to fall because, while UC's portfolio managers were sleeping, most other large institutional investors were unloading Enron and cutting their losses. 
There are some lessons here. 
For individual investors, the stock market is very risky. To safely invest, buy broad-based index funds. If you pick stocks, have the discipline to sell any dog in your portfolio like Enron--or any one of a number of once high-flying tech stocks--that loses more than 8% to 10% of its value. 
For President Bush, who will soon press Congress to privatize Social Security, there is this troubling question: If supposedly sophisticated portfolio managers like those at the University of California can lose so much money, is it really prudent to allow individuals to gamble their Social Security on individual stocks? 
As for the courts, a jury will probably find Enron executives and some errant auditors from the Arthur Andersen accounting firm liable for actions worthy of a multibillion-dollar judgment. 
Personally, I would rather see any judgment used to make whole all of the Enron employees--below the executive ranks--who lost their retirement savings. 
Unlike the incompetent UC portfolio managers who could have sold their stock at any time and kept their losses small, these employees were forbidden to cash out. 
At least they have an excuse.

Amer Elec Power Buys Indian Mesa Wind Project Facilities

12/31/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

COLUMBUS, Ohio -(Dow Jones)- American Electric Power Co. (AEP) acquired the 160-megawatt Indian Mesa Wind Power Project in Iraan, Texas from Enron Wind Corp. of California. 
In a press release Monday, American Electric said it funded the $175 million acquisition internally, but it intends to seek project financing at a later time.
The energy company also agreed to assume responsibility for the fulfillment of previously announced long-term power supply arrangements with City Public Service, the municipal electric utility of San Antonio. Enron Wind will provide operations and maintenance services. 
The Indian Mesa Wind Project, which uses 107 Enron Wind 1.5-megawatt turbines, was completed in December. 
American Electric expects the acquisition to add to earnings. 
The company had 2000 earnings, before extraordinary items, of $631 million, or $1.96 a share, on revenue of $13.7 billion.

IN THE MONEY: CSFB Resigns From Enron Creditors Committee
By Carol S. Remond

12/31/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 
(This column was originally published Friday.) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- ""Either you're in or you're out.""
But Credit Suisse First Boston apparently missed this memorable line from the movie ""Ocean's Eleven."" 
In fact, the Swiss banking giant can't seem to make up its mind when it comes to Enron Corp. (ENE). Just days after going through the trouble of getting a much coveted seat on Enron's unsecured creditors committee, CSFB had a change of heart and abruptly resigned. 
According to court documents filed with the U.S. bankruptcy court for the Southern District of New York, CSFB has now been replaced by Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale. 
CSFB stepped down from its position on the 15-member creditors committee shortly after it was formed on Dec. 12. 
Large banks and other creditors normally vie for membership in various creditor committees formed after a company files for bankruptcy in order to gain access to otherwise difficult-to-obtain information. Creditors also see membership as a way to guide a company's restructuring process in their favor. 
A spokesman for CSFB said the bank resigned after only one meeting of the creditors committee. ""We decided that membership would take up too much time and bring relatively small benefits given our limited exposure"" to Enron, he said. 
Enron filed for Chapter 11 protection earlier this month. The energy trader listed a trade debt to CSFB of $70.66 million in its bankruptcy filing. 
Even given CSFB's relatively modest Enron liabilities, some restructuring specialists were puzzled by the bank's decision to step down from the creditors committee. 
""When you're on the committee you get a birdseye view of the company's financials. It's quite intriguing that they chose to resign,"" a lawyer said. 
CSFB's move could have been prompted by the banks' decision to sell its exposure, another lawyer suggested. 
""They may just have wanted to take a look and then decided that they wanted to get out of their position,"" the second lawyer said. 
In addition to Westdeutsche, Enron's unsecured creditors committee includes: Enron's two lead banks, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup; ABN Amro Bank; Credit Lyonnais; National City Bank; Silvercreek Management Inc.; Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota N.A.; Oaktree Capital Management LLC; Bank of New York; St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co.; Duke Energy Trading & Marketing LLC; National Energy Group Inc., Williams Cos. and Michael P. Moran. 
Separately, the creditors committee took steps late Thursday to set up procedures that would allow members to continue trading Enron's bonds and stock without violating their fiduciary duties. 
Such trading would be allowed ""provided that any committee member executing such trades must establish and effectively implement the policies and procedures set forth herein, such as fire walls to prevent the misuse of non-public information obtained through its activities as a committee member,"" according to an application filed with the court by the creditors committee. 
Fire walls, also known as Chinese Walls, are a Wall Street staple, supposedly separating financial services groups' operations for ethical, fiduciary and legal reasons. 
The creditors' proposed application is scheduled to be presented to bankruptcy judge Arthur J. Gonzalez on Jan. 9

California Utility Regulator Lynch Comments on the Power Crisis
2001-12-31 03:03 (New York)


     San Francisco, Dec. 31 (Bloomberg) -- California Public
Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch talks about the power
crisis that hit California this year. Millions of Californians
lost their power during six days of blackouts in January, March
and May, and the state's two largest utilities, units of PG&E
Corp. and Edison International, are insolvent.

On the state's electricity deregulation plan, approved unanimously
by the California Legislature in 1996:

     ``One thing that's clear to me when I talk to people who were
around in 1996 is that no one anticipated the complete meltdown of
our power market. There weren't any safeguards or triggers built
into the plan to either evaluate or stop it if things went awry.''

On investigations by the Public Utilities Commission and the
California attorney general into alleged market manipulation by
power generators and traders:

     ``For the first six months of our investigation, which
started last December, we were in huge document fights with the
sellers, which went to the California Supreme Court. We won those
fights eventually, but that put us behind by about six months.''

     The legal fights delayed the investigation, and thus the
filing of criminal charges or lawsuits, Lynch said.

     ``It's a huge job to be able to determine trends and
concerns. So I don't think it's a surprise. And I think it's well
within the range of these investigations to take the time both the
PUC and the AG have been taking.''

On the bankruptcy of Enron Corp., once the world's largest energy
trader:

     ``Enron's business plan depended on a Wild, Wild West with no
cop in the market. And they got it. They got it for a while. One
thing that hurt Enron was the feds coming in and bounding
California's market. What's volatile and good for Enron is
burdensome and bad for California. Enron could squeeze every penny
out of this market and hold it over a barrel. And they did that
this year.''

Enron, Providian, Others Win the `Stocky' Awards: David Wilson
2001-12-31 00:43 (New York)


     (Commentary. David Wilson is a columnist for Bloomberg News.
The opinions expressed are his own.)

     Princeton, New Jersey, Dec. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Last year, this
column introduced the Stocky Awards, designed to commemorate some
of the year's standout performances in the U.S. stock market.

     It's time to bring them back for a second appearance. There
aren't any standing categories; each award is uniquely suited to
its recipient. The envelopes, please ...

     Rhymes with Dot-Com Award: Enron, naturally. The collapse of
Enron Corp., once the largest energy trader, produced the kind of
losses that investors in numerous ``dot-com'' companies sustained
during the past couple of years.

     Enron's shares plummeted 99 percent. Partnerships led by
Andrew Fastow, fired as chief financial officer in October, cost
the Houston-based company $1.2 billion of shareholder equity. The
company also restated 4 1/2 years of results, lost Dynegy Inc. as
a suitor, and made the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing ever.

     Serves Them Right for All That Junk Mail Award: Providian
Financial Corp., the fifth-largest U.S. issuer of MasterCard and
Visa credit cards, was the year's worst performer among companies
still in the Standard & Poor's 500 index.

     Shares of the San Francisco-based company tumbled 94 percent
as loan losses mounted. The bank wrote off 10 percent of average
loans in the second and third quarters, and estimated that the
fourth-quarter figure would be 12 percent.

     Shailesh Mehta, chief executive officer since 1998, resigned
in October. In November, Providian said federal banking regulators
had prevented the company from issuing cards to less-creditworthy
consumers -- targeted in recent years -- and limited loan growth.

     It's a Family Affair Award: Ford Motor Co., the second-
largest automaker, and Hewlett-Packard Co., the No. 2 maker of
computers, share the honor.

     Ford named William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of founder
Henry Ford, as CEO. He replaced Jacques Nasser in October after
the Dearborn, Michigan-based company lost more than $1 billion
during the second and third quarters.

     The sons of Hewlett-Packard's co-founders, William Hewlett
and David Packard, decided to oppose CEO Carly Fiorina's plan for
the Palo Alto, California-based company to acquire Compaq Computer
Corp. for $23 billion.

     What's in a Name Award: Philip Morris Cos., the largest
cigarette maker, said in November that it wants to become Altria
Group Inc. and will ask shareholders to approve the name change in
April. Some similarly named companies weren't happy about that.

     Altira Group, a venture-capital firm in Denver, filed a
lawsuit seeking to block Philip Morris from making the change.
Altria Healthcare Corp., a Birmingham, Alabama-based provider of
health-care billing, consulting and training services, asked the
New York-based company to ``do the right thing'' and reconsider.

     Welcome to the S&P 500 Award: Real estate investment trusts,
omitted from the benchmark index since the 1970s, became eligible
again this year.

     Equity Office Properties Trust, the most valuable REIT,
joined the S&P 500 on Oct. 10. Equity Residential Properties
Trust, the second most valuable, followed on Dec. 3. Both are
based in Chicago, and billionaire Sam Zell is their chairman.

     Domino Theory Award: Companies targeted in asbestos-related
cases kept going into bankruptcy. Federal-Mogul Corp., W.R. Grace
& Co. and USG Corp., the owner of U.S. Gypsum, sought Chapter 11
protection as the number of claims increased. So did G-I Holdings
Inc., owner of GAF Corp., and U.S. Mineral Products Co. They are
among more than 40 companies to file since the 1980s.

     Claims tied to asbestos, which can cause cancer and lung
disease, also weighed on companies such as Halliburton Co., an oil-
services and construction company based in Dallas. Its stock
tumbled 42 percent on Dec. 7 after a Maryland jury ordered a unit
to pay $30 million in one case.

     Recession? What Recession? Award: The lineup of the S&P 500's
best-performing stocks hardly suggests that the U.S. economy ended
a decade-long expansion this year, or that the just-ended holiday
shopping season may have been the worst in 15 years.

     Retailers -- namely AutoZone Inc., Best Buy Co., Circuit City
Group, Office Depot Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. -- accounted for five
of the year's six largest percentage gains. Nvidia Corp., a maker
of computer-graphics chips, was the exception.

     Lowe's Cos., the second-largest chain of home-improvement
stores, also was a top-10 performer. The company's stock price
more than doubled, far surpassing the 13 percent gain for Home
Depot Inc., its bigger rival.

     Better Than Cipro Award: Providers of security software,
which safeguards computers against damaging programs such as
viruses, had a stellar year.

     Network Associates Inc., the maker of McAfee software, rose
more than sixfold. The Santa Clara, California-based company had
far and away the biggest gain in the S&P MidCap 400, an index of
smaller companies than those in the S&P 500. Its McAfee.com Corp.
unit, which sells software online, jumped more than sevenfold.

     Symantec Corp., which sells software such as Norton Anti-
Virus, more than doubled. The Cupertino, California-based company
finished the year by joining the Nasdaq-100 index, a gauge of the
Nasdaq Stock Market's biggest companies.

     I Remember California Award: Edison International and PG&E
Corp., the owners of California's two largest utilities, had an up-
and-down -- make that down-and-up -- year in 2001.

     Shares of both companies dropped in January to their lowest
price in more than two decades amid blackouts and a state takeover
of power purchases. PG&E, based in San Francisco, fell further in
April as its Pacific Gas & Electric unit filed for bankruptcy.

     Edison, the Rosemead, California-based parent of Southern
California Edison, and PG&E later rebounded as the state's power
crisis subsided. Their losses narrowed by the end of last week to
2.5 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively.

     The King Is Dead, Long Live the King Award: Video-rental
chains haven't disappeared, even as cable-television and Internet
companies pursue ``video on demand.'' Instead, their share prices
jumped amid growing demand for DVDs, which are more profitable to
rent than videocassettes.

     The largest U.S. chain -- Blockbuster Inc., owned by Viacom
Inc. -- more than tripled. Hollywood Entertainment Corp., the No.
2 chain, and Movie Gallery Inc., ranked No. 3, soared more than 10-
fold and were among the year's best-performing U.S. stocks.

     It's tempting to give an honorable mention to any stock
investor with an overall gain for the year, because the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index all
dropped. But there aren't any more awards around. Maybe next year.

USA: Enron reps met 6 times with Cheney or his staff.

01/08/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Representatives of the collapsed energy giant Enron Corp. met six times with Vice President Dick Cheney or staff from his energy task force, the White House has told a Democratic lawmaker. 
In a Jan. 3 letter to Rep. Henry Waxman, vice presidential counsel David Addington said that Enron's Chairman Kenneth Lay met Cheney once during the development of the administration's energy plan. Cheney has already acknowledged this publicly.
But the Addington letter also revealed five further meetings with Cheney's energy task force staff, three of which took place before the White House energy policy was announced in May and two afterwards. 
Enron's financial position was not discussed in any of the meetings, Addington's letter to Waxman said. Waxman, a California Democrat and ranking member of the Government Reform Committee, released the Addington letter on Tuesday. The lawmaker had written to Cheney's office seeking information on Enron's possible influence on administration policy. 
""Enron did not communicate information about its financial position in any of the meetings with the Vice President or with the National Energy Policy Development Group's support staff,"" said the Addington letter. 
Waxman, in a reply addressed to Cheney, noted the meetings with Cheney or his energy task force staff had stretched from last Feb. 22 to Oct. 10, just a few days before Enron announced a reduction in shareholder equity ahead of its spectacular collapse. 
""For the first time, the letter from Mr. Addington provides some limited details about the contacts between Enron and the energy task force,"" Waxman told Cheney. ""It reveals that Enron had extensive access to the task force, meeting in person six times with you or the task force staff to discuss 'energy policy matters'"".

USA: Enron gets bids for trading operations-sources.

01/08/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - At least two banks submitted bids for a controlling stake in Enron Corp.'s dormant energy trading business, likely ensuring its revival in coming weeks, people familiar with the company's plans said Tuesday. 
Enron, which declared bankruptcy on Dec. 2, received bids from Citicorp Inc. and UBS Warburg for the Houston-based energy trading operations. But a third financial institution that previously expressed interest, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. , declined to submit a bid by last night, the deadline for bids for the Enron assets, these people said.
Citicorp, UBS Warburg and J.P. Morgan declined to comment on any interest in Enron assets. Enron officials could not be reached. 
The deadline brought news of a new party that may be interested in Enron's trading operations, once the world's biggest trader of contracts for natural gas and other energy commodities, 
British oil giant BP Plc also said it may be interested in the operations. BP said it had submitted a bid of $25 million for a small portion of Enron's assets, including some back office functions and information technology assets, but said it may be interested in other assets as well. 
Enron has all but shut down its Houston-based trading operations while it seeks a financial backer that could guarantee contracts. 
Previously, Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and UBS Warburg had expressed interest in this role, according to people familiar with the company's plans. 
It is unclear whether there have been other bids for the trading operations. The company is slated to decide on Thursday whether to accept a bid. Enron lawyers previously stated that the company is not looking for cash bids, but rather an ownership stake of up to 51 percent. 
Any bid for the trading operations must be approved by Judge Arthur Gonzalez of the Southern District of New York bankruptcy court, which is overseeing Enron's Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. 
Enron is offloading the trading operations to generate cash to pay off as much as $40 billion in debt. 
Enron collapsed after disclosures of hidden debt in off-balance sheet transactions destroyed investor confidence in the Houston-based company. Enron's advisors have made it a priority to revive the trading operations, which have all but stalled in the wake of the bankruptcy filing.

USA: REPEAT-BP bids $25 million for Enron back office/IT assets.

01/08/2002

(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Oil major BP has bid $25 million for a small portion of Enron Corp.'s assets, mainly back office functions and information technology systems, a company spokeswoman said on Tuesday. 
Enron's full energy trading business is scheduled to be auctioned in a federal bankruptcy court on Jan. 10.
""We're bidding for software, business processes, and license rights,"" the BP spokeswoman said. 
Once the world's leading energy trader, Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December, after questions around its financial dealings led to the company's collapse. 
BP may be interested in bidding for other Enron assets if the current auction process breaks down, the spokeswoman added.

BP Says Submitted $25M Bid For Enron Support Systems
By Michael Wang

01/08/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.K. integrated oil major BP PLC (BP) said Tuesday that it has submitted a $25 million offer to buy Enron Corp.'s (ENE) computer settlement support systems used to process the trading of energy products.
""The bid was made yesterday (Monday),"" BP spokesman Roddy Kennedy told Dow Jones Newswires. ""We are interested in the technology. It would improve our marketing capacity."" 
BP is one of the top 10 marketers of natural gas in the U.S., selling volumes of over 12 billion cubic feet a day. 
The support systems are primarily used in back-office activities involving the settlement and administration of natural gas and electricity contracts. 
BP's bid for the technology will go into an ""auction"" Thursday, when Enron's advisers are expected to press bidders to improve their offers. Results are expected to be known Friday. 
The bidding process follows Enron's collapse last month, when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy law protection. The process allows Houston-based Enron time to reorganize its activities while keeping creditors at bay. 
The revelation that BP is bidding for a back-office processing system comes after the Wall Street Journal Europe reported Tuesday that it had submitted an offer for Enron's energy-trading arm, EnronOnline, considered a prominent asset in the tangled portfolio of the broke energy concern. 
Kennedy denied that BP has submitted a bid for EnronOnline. 
But he added that the oil company would be prepared to ""negotiate on a non-binding basis"" other unspecified Enron businesses, if the current auction process is abandoned. 
""If the (bidding process) doesn't work out, we would be willing to negotiate certain other parts of the business,"" Kennedy said. He wouldn't elaborate.

Cornyn asks for committee of former Enron employees

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

AUSTIN (AP) - Attorney General John Cornyn has asked a federal bankruptcy court in New York to appoint a committee of former Enron Corp. employees to voice their interests as the fallen energy giant wades through its massive Chapter 11 case. 
""I am very concerned by the countless stories of former employees who lost their life savings in 401(k) plans when Enron and its affiliates sought bankruptcy protection,"" Cornyn said in a news release Tuesday.
He said the 4,500 employees laid off from the company's Houston headquarters soon after Enron filed for bankruptcy in New York on Dec. 2 ""deserve a resounding voice in Enron's reorganization."" More than 2,800 of those former employees have filed claims for unemployment benefits, Cornyn said. 
Deputy Attorney General Jeff Boyd was among several lawyers representing creditors who argued Monday that Enron's bankruptcy should be transferred to Houston. Boyd argued on behalf of several state agencies with Enron claims. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez said he would rule on the transfer requests by the end of the week.

Cal-ISO To File Price Estimates For FERC Refund Case

01/08/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This article was originally published Monday) 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Independent System Operator will file with federal regulators by Thursday its estimate of what electricity prices would have been if current price controls had been in place between Oct. 2000-May 2001, an ISO spokesman confirmed Monday.
The information will be used by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to determine if and how much generators must refund to power buyers for overcharging during that period. 
A Dec. 19 FERC order set a ceiling price for West Coast power during times of high demand at $108 per megawatt hour, which the ISO will use in making its calculations. The previous ceiling price, adopted in June, was $92/MWh. 
The upcoming ISO filing won't apply the revised prices to specific market transactions, meaning there will be no estimate of what certain generators owe, said ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman. 
""We are asking FERC to use this incarnation of calculations as a basis for moving forward. If we discover reasons we need to rework these numbers again, fine, but let's not wait to move forward,"" on hearings, Fishman said. 
FERC is expected to set a hearing schedule on the refund case Tuesday. 
California officials say generators overcharged the state $8.9 billion and were largely responsible for the state's energy crisis. Generators deny the claim. 
Generators involved in the FERC case include Reliant Energy Inc (REI), Calpine Corp (CPN), Mirant Corp (MIR), Dynegy Inc (DYN), the Williams Companies (WMB), Duke Energy Corp (DUK), and Enron Corp (ENE).

Democrats: Don't Gloat About Enron

As Congress gears up for hearings on Enron's $60 billion collapse, some Democrats are savoring a chance to investigate links between the company and its many G.O.P. friends in the White House and Congress. But the scandal may wind up tainting Democrats as well. Florida's state pension fund, which lost $325 million on Enron, is examining, as part of a broader inquiry, what role Frank Savage, a major Democratic donor, may have played in the state's loss. The fund's investments were directed by Alliance Capital Management, where Savage was a senior executive and chairman at the same time he sat on Enron's board. 
State officials want to know whether he inappropriately pushed Enron's stock on the pension fund while the energy giant was failing. Alliance more than doubled the state's stake in Enron since last August, buying 5.6 million shares in three months, even as stock prices fell and analysts questioned the firm's management and accounting practices. Coleman Stipanovich, deputy executive administrator of the pension fund, said his staff would like to learn what Savage knew of Enron's internal problems and what, if anything, he passed on to fund managers at Alliance. ""We're going to want to be satisfied there was no undue influence,"" he told TIME.
An Alliance spokesman said Savage, who headed an international subsidiary until leaving the firm in August, had no influence on Enron trading. Savage did not return calls for comment. Since joining Enron's heavily Republican board in 1999, he has donated $100,000 to Democrats and is raising money for New York gubernatorial candidate Carl McCall. Which proves, if nothing else, that Enron was a bipartisan debacle.

WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - An Enron Corp. employee warned the energy giant's top executive in August 2001 about potential problems with how it accounted for certain transactions, Congressional investigators said on Monday. 
The unidentified employee wrote Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay raising several areas of concern, including ownership interests in certain partnerships, how accountant Andersen treated partnerships on Enron's books and the potential impact on Enron's financial statements, Reps. Billy Tauzin and James Greenwood said.
The employee described a ""veil of secrecy"" around some of the partnerships in question, the lawmakers said in letters to Enron and its auditor Andersen seeking more information. 
On Oct. 16, Enron reported its first quarterly loss in over four years, taking a $1.2 billion charge against shareholder equity relating to dealing with partnerships run by then Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Attorneys for Enron Corp. , the bankrupt energy company, said on Monday they will delay the release of details about Enron's trading unit sale to UBS AG until 11 p.m. EST. 
Enron on Friday said it would sell a controlling stake in its key energy trading unit to UBS Warburg, the investment banking unit of Switzerland's largest bank. It said at the time it would release details of the sale at 2 p.m. EST on Monday.
Attorneys for Weil Gotshal and Manges didn't disclose reasons for the delay, which Enron said would be posted on its Web site, www.enron.com, and on the Web site of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, which is adjudicating Enron's bankruptcy case.

Enron Gets No Cash Upfront In Deal With UBS Warburg
By Kathy Chu and Carol S. Remond

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Although the deal between Enron Corp. (ENE) and UBS Warburg (U.UBS) has yet to be finalized, details are beginning to emerge.
Under a plan to revive Enron's energy-trading operations, UBS will acquire 100% ownership of the bankrupt company's core business. Meanwhile, Enron and its creditors will get 33% of the new business' pretax profits for at least two years, people familiar with the matter said. 
Enron will get no cash upfront. 
""We got the best that the best people could get,"" Enron lawyer Martin Bienenstock said Friday at a court hearing in which the deal was announced. 
Under the proposed 10-year plan, UBS will have the option to reduce and eventually to eliminate payouts to Enron after two years. 
UBS may get an option to reduce profit-royalty payments to Enron to 22% in the third year, 11% the year after that, and eventually down to nothing, according to people familiar with the deal. 
But if the Swiss financial institution doesn't exercise its options by the end of the fifth year, Enron may get an incremental increase in the energy-trading operation's profits - up to 45% by the end of the agreement. 
Also under the agreement, UBS is expected to pay rent on Enron's Houston office space and to hire most of the company's energy-trading employees. Jeffrey McMahon, Enron's chief financial officer, has said that the unit employs between 400 and 1,000 workers, including traders and marketing staff.

USA: Lawmaker sees insider trading ""evidence"" at Enron.

01/14/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee said on Monday there was ""pretty strong evidence"" of insider trading as well as false accounting in the fall of the energy-trading giant Enron Corp. 
Rep. John Dingell of Michigan, whose committee is one of those investigating Enron , spoke on CBS television's ""The Early Show.""
""There's pretty strong evidence of insider trading,"" at Enron, Dingell said, adding that there was ""clear evidence of failure to file honest and correct annual reports"" required by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
""There may be a number of other things here which were going on, including possible insider trading and possible misuse of insider accounts,"" the lawmaker continued. 
""False accounting appears to be a very major problem, and it appears that both Enron and the accounting firm were involved in this matter."" 
Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, has admitted that it destroyed a number of Enron documents. 
Spokesmen for Enron and Andersen could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Thousands of employees lost their pensions and life savings in the downfall of Enron last year after the company acknowledged several hundred million dollars of previously undisclosed liabilities. The company filed for bankruptcy on Dec 2. 
Some Enron shareholders have filed a lawsuit accusing a group of 29 Enron executives and directors of ""unlawful insider trading"" and misleading the investing public. 
Several congressional committees are investigating Enron's demise, and some lawmakers on those committees have said they want to probe whether Enron employees and shareholders were deceived. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating. 
Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, wrote to Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay over the weekend to ask him to explain why he sent out optimistic e-mails to Enron employees in August about the company's prospects. 
Dingell is one of 188 House members who received campaign contributions from Enron. The donations to Dingell's campaign totaled $9,000 since 1989, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group.

USA: Senate banking committee says sets hearing on Enron.

01/14/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The powerful Senate Banking Committee said on Monday it will hold a Feb. 12 hearing on Enron Corp., the energy trading giant whose bankruptcy filing last year threw thousands out of work, devastated investors and raised questions about its accounting practices. 
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee Chairman Paul Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat, said the hearing will focus on ""accounting and investor protection issues surrounding the problems with Enron Corporation and other public companies.""
The Houston, Texas-based company, once ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of large corporations, is being probed by five other congressional committees, the market-regulating Securities and Exchange Commission and the Labor Department. The Justice Department has launched a criminal probe of Enron. 
The committee said Sarbanes has invited five former chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission to testify. 
The following former chairmen of the SEC have been invited to testify: Roderick Hills (1975-77); Harold Williams (1977-81); David Ruder (1987-89); Richard Breeden (1989-93); and Arthur Levitt (1993-2000), the committee said. 
Once the world's largest energy trader, Enron slid in mere weeks late last year from Wall Street stardom to making the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history on Dec. 2. Its downfall threw thousands out of work and devastated investors. 
The episode sapped the life savings of many Enron employees whose 401(k) plans were heavily invested in Enron stock, while top executives allegedly pocketed fat profits by selling ahead of a dizzying plunge in the share price.

USA: Former Enron CEO Skilling shorted competitor's stock.

01/14/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Jeffrey Skilling, the former chief executive of Enron Corp. , sold short AES Corp.'s stock last summer in a bet that the competing power company's share price would fall, his spokeswoman said on Monday. 
Skilling's spokeswoman said he decided to short the stock after reading a newspaper article that reported AES would be hurt by Brazil's weakening currency. AES, based in Arlington, Virginia, has a significant power business in Brazil.
""He was well aware of what a challenging environment Brazil was for companies at that time,"" said spokeswoman Judy Leon. 
Skilling, however, did not trade on any inside information he may have received during his job as CEO of Enron, his spokeswoman said. She declined to discuss specifics of the trade, including how much money was involved. 
""We're not commenting on his personal finances,"" Leon said. 
The trade was initiated on Aug. 24, or about 10 days after Skilling resigned as Enron's president and CEO, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the short sale. 
The Wall Street Journal said the trade could have made Skilling a profit of more than $15 million, depending when he closed out the trade, since shares of AES fell steadily in the weeks after he shorted the stock. Indeed, on Sept. 26 shares of AES dropped almost 50 percent after it warned it would fall well short of 2001 earnings estimates. 
Shares of other energy companies also fell during the period. 
Skilling - who along with other past and present Enron executives is facing shareholder lawsuits because of the company's collapse - has denied any wrongdoing in Enron's spiral into bankruptcy. 
Skilling joined Enron in 1990 after leaving McKinsey & Co.'s energy czz Co.'s energy czz.

Source: Buyer of Enron's power trading division to share profits with Enron and creditors
By ALAN CLENDENNING
AP Business Writer

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK (AP) - The Swiss investment bank that is buying Enron Corp.'s power trading business will share a third of its profits with Enron and its creditors, a source familiar with the situation said Monday. 
The plan, being presented in bankruptcy court, also calls for UBS Warburg to purchase the unit without paying any cash up front, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The terms were expected to be made public Monday afternoon in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
Representatives of UBS Warburg and Enron didn't immediately return telephone calls seeking comment Monday. 
Enron and its creditors will get 33 percent of the new business' pretax profits for at least two years, the source said. Stamford, Conn.-based UBS Warburg, a division of Switzerland's UBS AG, will have the option of buying one-third of Enron's stake after three years, and to buy the rest of its stake in subsequent years. 
Enron collapsed late last year amid revelations of complex partnerships used to keep billions of dollars in debt off its books and mask financial problems so it could continue to get cash and credit to run the trading business. 
UBS Warburg won the bidding Friday for the trading operation, beating out rival suitor Citigroup Inc., a large Enron creditor. The deal must be approved by Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez; a hearing is set for Friday. 
Enron's energy trading business generated about 90 percent of the company's $101 billion in revenue in 2000. The deal does not include existing contracts Enron has to supply power, valued at between $6 billion and $7 billion. 
Trading of Enron shares, which sold for $83 a year ago but have changed hands at no higher than $1 since December, were halted Friday and Monday on the New York Stock Exchange for the sale announcement. UBS' U.S.-traded shares fell 44 cents to $49.51 Monday morning on the NYSE. 
Before its collapse late last year, Enron was the world's largest energy merchant and the nation's seventh-largest company by revenue. Enron differed from competitors in its penchant for complex bets on everything under the sun - advertising space, broadband, the weather, paper and more than 1,000 other products.

At Enron, Ignorance Was Bliss 
Dan Ackman, Forbes.com, 01.14.02, 8:50 AM ET 

NEW YORK - What did he know and when did he know it? 

This is the question famously asked about President Nixon and Watergate. It will now be asked about Enron. It is being asked about President George W. Bush. But it will also be asked more pointedly, for now, about Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay; its briefly serving chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling; and their top executives. 
Over the weekend, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans said they had not told the president about calls from Lay that alerted them to Enron's impending doom. They also said they had done nothing to bail out the ailing energy trader after its president, Greg Whalley, had asked a senior Treasury official to help arrange bank loans in late October and early November. 
O'Neill said took he two calls--one at his home on Sunday, Oct. 28, the other at his office on Nov. 8 or 9--from Lay. Mr. Lay offered ""a heads-up"" about the corporation's credit crisis but asked for nothing, O'Neill said. 

""I didn't think this was worthy of me running across the street and telling the president,"" Mr. O'Neill told Fox News on Sunday. ""I frankly think what Ken told me over the phone was not new news."" 

Not news? If Enron was too far gone for help at this point, Enron certainly wasn't admitting the fact. 

Indeed, at this point, Enron was in feverish negotiations with Dynegy, its smaller rival, about a buyout. Enron, to this day says a merger at that date would have been fruitful and is suing Houston-based Dynegy for backing out of it. 

In late October, Enron, also based in Houston, was still borrowing heavily. On Oct. 25, it said it had drawn $1 billion from banks against its existing unsecured credit lines. On Nov. 1, it announced that J.P. Morgan Chase and Solomon Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup, had agreed to lend it another $1 billion in secured credit. 

On Oct. 29, Lay called Evans to ask about reviews of Enron's business by credit agencies, and Lay did ask for help. Evans said he did nothing to assist Lay or Enron, but also said Lay did not make him aware of the full story. 

""When I was talking to Ken I wasn't thinking about bankruptcy,"" Evans said in an interview with NBC's Meet the Press. ""I was thinking maybe their credit rating would be dropped some ... but it wasn't the crisis yet that ensued some 30 days later."" Evans said he was not told any information that had not already been made public. 

In other words, what O'Neill said was old news, Evans said was still an unfolding saga. Enron, for its part, was still, it appears, spinning a happier story to creditors and possible merger partners. 

Unlike O'Neill, Evans said he did inform the White House--not the president himself but Chief of Staff Andrew Card Jr. about the call. He also said he generally discussed Enron's problems with President Bush several times in November and December. Evans told Bush ""how sad it was to see what was happening to that once great company,"" but he omitted mention of Lay's calls. 

Evans said he never considered doing a favor for Lay. ""If I had stepped in, I think it would have been an egregious abuse of the office of secretary of commerce,"" he said on Meet the Press. 

It is not clear what kind of help Evans might have provided. He might have offered a subtle nudge to bankers or credit agencies. Evans could possibly have bought the company some time, if nothing else. 

But the irony here is that Enron was so politically connected, and its political connections so well known, that any effort to bail out the company in November or December of 2001 would have been politically impossible, even assuming it would have been sound policy. Enron was too hot to handle, at least in any public way. 

Enron's demise, however, does not seem to have caused a ripple in the economy or even the energy sector, beyond its devastating effect on Enron's employees and retirement plan members, whose savings were wiped out with the deflation of Enron's shares. Enron's demise has also affected Houston's cultural community, which Enron helped fund. But the fact that the company--the nation's seventh largest, according to its claimed revenue--could file for bankruptcy and cease its most lucrative operations without wider effect suggests how economically inconsequential Enron was all along. 

Enron did have an impact in the political sector. Nearly half of the current members of the House of Representatives and about three-quarters of all senators received contributions from the company. Enron has contributed a total of $5.7 million to both political parties since 1989, 73% to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 

Lay and other Enron employees were among the president's largest political benefactors. They doled out $623,000 over the course of his political career, according to another group that favors an overhaul of campaign finance, the Center for Public Integrity. 

While Enron got no help from the government on its death bed, its seeding of the nation's political system no doubt bore fruit along the way. Enron was tight with politicians and with Wall Street, whose analysts almost universally backed the company even after Lay was placing calls to Cabinet officers. As a result, in both the financial community and in the political community, few questions were asked during Enron's rise.



Dabhol Power on the verge of shutting operations

The cash-strapped Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is on the verge of shutting its operations in India. 
Close on the heels of handing out pink slips to about 200 of its employees in the country last month, it may now have to lay off its support staff which had been retained as consultants. DPC has already shut its Delhi office and is now taking preliminary steps to close its Mumbai office.
""We had retained a core team after the last round of lay offs. For the last few months, we have not paid their salaries. But, it is very difficult to say if the core team will be asked to go at this point of time. We have also asked employees in the Mumbai office not to attend work as we are not in a position to pay even the electricity bills,"" a DPC spokesman said. 
DPC may even lay off the security personnel at the 2,184 mw project site at Ratnagiri district in Maharashtra. The project site has about 300 security personnel. 
""Since the security of the assets is essential, withdrawing the already insufficient security staff can only be the last resort. But, if immediate funding is not forthcoming, even that might happen,"" the spokesman added. 
DPC has squarely put the blame for the present state of affairs on the default on bill payments by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the refusal by the lenders to use the existing DPC funds or infuse fresh funds. 
DPC executives say that the lenders had at their last meeting in Singapore informally agreed to release funds in the trust and retention account, but have not done so till date. 
The trust and retention account, with around $8 to $10 million funds, is being operated by the Bank of America. DPC cannot touch this money without the consent of the lenders. 
Enron, General Electric and Bechtel, which hold a combined stake of 85 per cent in DPC, have decided to exit the project following a payments dispute with MSEB. Tata Power, BSES, Shell and the Gas Authority of India Ltd are in the fray for acquiring their stake.

BG Remains In Talks With Enron For Indian Upstream Assets
By Michael Wang

Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.K. oil and gas concern BG Group PLC (BRG) said Monday it remained in talks with Enron Corp. (ENE) to renegotiate a $388 million deal to acquire the financially-stricken U.S. company's upstream assets in India. 
""We are continuing to negotiate a new deal with Enron,"" said BG spokesman Robin O'Kelly.
Johan Zaayman, a spokesman at the Houston-based Enron which recently filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition, said ""we are still trying to iron out the details."" He declined to elaborate. 
The two sides have been forced to rework the original transaction, signed Oct. 3, when BG missed a Dec. 20 deadline to clinch a separate, but related, agreement with Indian partners on management rights to three offshore oil and gas fields. 
Since late December, BG has been in separate negotiations with Enron and state-owned Indian oil and gas company Oil and Natural Gas Corp., or ONGC, in a bid to salvage a major expansion program in the sub-continent. 
O'Kelly wouldn't say when BG last talked with Enron and wouldn't be drawn on a likely date when the transaction will be re-signed. 
BG has faced acute embarrassment having thrice failed to meet self-imposed deadlines on resolving the thorny issue of operatorship, or day-to-day management, of the Panna, Mukta and Tapti fields with ONGC. 
ONGC holds a 40% stake in the fields and BG is aiming to acquire Enron's 30% interest and inherit its operatorship of the assets. Indian petrochemicals company Reliance Industries Ltd. owns the remaining 30% of the three fields. 
A source close to the talks denied BG is trying to take advantage of Enron's financial problems and renegotiate a sweeter deal. 
""If we get this deal with Enron at a lower price, than that's a bonus,"" the source said. ""We're still very happy with $388 million (as the price tag)."" 
Nevertheless, O'Kelly expressed concern that with Enron in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the process of renegotiation could become complicated as it will involve a bankruptcy judge. 
""It doesn't make it any easier,"" he said. 
BG's negotiations with ONGC appear at a standstill. 
According to ONGC officials, BG has twice offered cash payments to ONGC in exchange for operatorship rights. The first, in late November for $7.5 million, was rejected by ONGC as inadequate. 
A second offer, which analysts believe was around $8.5-$9.0 million, was also dismissed. Indian-based analysts reckon a cash offer close to $18 million would secure operatorship for BG. 
According to one London-based analyst, the British exploration and production company has also reportedly dangled, without luck, slices of some of its Brazilian offshore acreage. 
O'Kelly wouldn't comment on the state of discussions with ONGC. 
But, a two-day international oil and gas conference in New Delhi beginning Tuesday may offer the opportunity for both sides to rekindle talks. BG India Chief Executive Nigel Shaw is scheduled to make a presentation at the conference on Wednesday.

POINT OF VIEW: The Enron Saga Reaches A Whole New Level
By Michael Rapoport

01/14/2002
Dow Jones News Service

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- So the Enron Corp. (ENE) scandal has finally gone nuclear.
Not that this comes as a tremendous surprise. So far, Enron has sullied the reputation of just about everyone who's had anything much to do with it, from its auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, to one of its primary bankers, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), to the rest of the energy-trading industry. Why should George W. Bush be any different? 
All along, the only thing this saga of financial hanky-panky has been missing - the element to give this story the critical mass to push it from the business pages to the front page - is a real whiff of political hanky-panky. A concrete indication that Enron had tried to use its status as a major benefactor of the president of the United States to its own advantage. That's what we got last week, when it was revealed that Enron executives had called Bush administration officials as the company spiraled toward bankruptcy, to try to coax them to take action to help save the company. 
Administration officials have said they took no such action, but that hardly matters at the moment. For purposes of determining the significance the public and press assign this story in the scheme of things, what matters is that Enron made the attempt at all. Outside the narrow confines of Wall Street, most people don't know from conflict-ridden off-balance-sheet partnerships or shady accounting practices ... but everyone understands influence-peddling and how wrong it is. A scandal-ridden company asks for special favors from an administration it helped pay to put in office? Oh, boy. Or, to use President Bush's now-well-publicized nickname for Enron's chief executive: Oh, Kenny Boy. 
Combine that with the near-simultaneous news that Arthur Andersen has shredded Enron-related documents - destruction of evidence being another bit of scandalous behavior that a layman can easily understand - and all of a sudden a complex financial story has been elevated to a thoroughly mainstream, they'll-talk-about-it-on-the-street-as-well-as-the-Street scandal. 
You want to know how mainstream this story is now? The three major network Sunday-morning talk shows, not usually renowned for their explorations of financial fraud, all spent copious amounts of time on the Enron story this Sunday. Dennis Miller cracked before Saturday night's NFL playoff game that the New York Jets, who had traveled between New York and California three times in a week, ""have been flying back and forth across this country more frequently than a bagman for Enron."" The topic of this week's Top Ten List contest on David Letterman's Web site: ""Top Ten Excuses of Enron's Executives."" That's how mainstream. 
The fact that there's no credible indication as yet that anyone in the Bush administration did anything improper about Enron isn't going to slow down the story one bit. The questions the Bushies face over Enron are at least as legitimate as the questions their predecessors the Clintonites faced for years over the Whitewater affair, and after congressional Republicans battered Bill Clinton for years with investigation after investigation, you'd better believe the Democrats are smelling payback. (Of course, the Democrats have to tread carefully; many of them got contributions from Enron too.) 
And it's an interesting quirk of timing, at the very least, that Bush's first in-depth public comments about the Enron fiasco came last week, just before the disclosures that may turn Enron into a major problem for his administration. 
It's kind of ironic: For weeks, the plight of thousands of Enron employees who've lost their retirement savings - Bush's fellow Texans, the bulk of them - couldn't make the broad public take much note of the Enron scandal, especially while the war in Afghanistan dominated the news. The prospect of a few highly placed people facing hard questions about what they did or didn't do on Enron's behalf has made people sit up and take notice virtually overnight. 
Where the investigation goes from here, no one can know. But for the first time, it appears President Bush, like others before him, may yet rue the day he first heard of Enron.

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders Hammer Out Debt Fix
By Christina Cheddar

01/14/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Homeowners know it only takes one lousy neighbor to ruin it for everyone else on the block.
For the power sector, the spoiler was Enron Corp. (ENE). The one-time industry leader's questionable financial practices and rapid descent into bankruptcy sent jitters through the market, forcing investors to re-evaluate whether the sector was on the wrong side of the tracks. 
Ratings agencies - particularly Moody's Investors Service - acting like a zealous neighborhood watch, tightened standards and gave ultimatums. Both Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Mirant Corp. (MIR) were faced with a credit rating downgrade that placed the companies below investment grade, while the ratings of Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) were put on watch for the same. 
Each energy merchant responded the best way it could. One by one, the companies began renovating balance sheets and launching recapitalization programs. 
Some threw out loans with triggers linked to credit ratings like bad shingles threatening to bring the roof down. Other firms moved off-balance sheet debt back onto financial statements, and announced ways to reduce debt and lower spending. Like so many corporate garage sales, assets - power plants, oil and gas properties, and even a refinery - went on the auction block, and new equity offerings were held. 
In other words, each company tried every way possible to show that despite the misdeeds of one neighbor, they were were all good corporate citizens. 
Investors and industry watchers may not agree on whether these balance sheet renovations were necessary improvements. But most will agree the changes are more than cosmetic, and will place the companies on the road to stronger performance. 
Susan Abbott, managing director at Moody's Investors Services, said the plans ""aren't just window dressing."" But she warned the magic will be in the execution. She is concerned that some companies may have difficulty raising additional funds through asset sales in what has quickly become a buyers' market. 
""From our perspective, the companies should sell assets that do not fit into the strategic plan,"" Abbott said. ""What are they doing owning these assets anyway?"" 
She expects oil and gas properties that have proven reserves will be among the first assets that will be divested, possibly in as little as 30 days. Other assets will take longer to sell. 
In some cases, equity offerings have bought firms some time to find the right buyer. (Unfortunately, at the expense of some value from current shareholders.) 
Equity Offerings Bought Time For Asset Sales 

""Mirant raised equity,"" Abbott said. ""That's a good thing for them. Their ability to sell $1.5 billion of assets ... that will be the execution part we will be anxiously waiting to see."" 
If Mirant achieves its goals, and Moody's restores Mirant's investment grade status, the upgrade will be a catalyst for the stock, said Richard Giesen, manager of the Munder Power Plus fund. Giesen said he took advantage of Mirant's equity offering to add shares to his portfolio. 
""I do think there's a good possibility Moody's could reverse (its downgrade) after the meeting with the company (this week),"" Giesen said. 
The Power Plus fund has roughly 9% of its assets invested in companies with energy trading operations, he said. As an investor in the sector, Giesen said he wishes the companies weren't forced to issue additional equity because of the earnings dilution. 
""I wish they hadn't done it, but I realize it was a necessary evil given the circumstances,"" he said. 
To get a sense of the impact, Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Fleishman said his 2002 earnings estimates were reduced by an average of 15% for those companies who announced recapitalization programs. 
But earnings dilution wasn't the only reason why investors appeared to be universally critical of Moody's decision to raise the bar for sector. Many said it was wrong to change the rules overnight. 
Moody's Abbott said she is aware of the criticism. 
""These companies have a need to grow,"" Abbott said, ""but the first step is to repair the balance sheets and establish a good relationship between cash flow and debt. ... Then the companies can focus on growth, but they can do it in a more balanced fashion, which means slower."" 
Market Waiting To Hear More During Earnings Season 

Fourth-quarter conference calls, which will begin this week, will give some of the companies in the group another chance to outline goals for the year. According to several portfolio managers, the market isn't likely to view aggressive growth plans favorably. 
Still, the portfolio managers aren't writing off the growth potential for the sector. 
""California dodged a major bullet because of unseasonably mild weather,"" Giesen said. Mild weather and a weak economy are masking regional supply shortages and transmission grid problems that could again result in higher energy prices and improved earnings power in the sector, according to the portfolio manager. 
Plus, the potential for oversupplied markets has been reduced as some companies cancel plans for power plants, said Merrill's Fleishman. 
""We note, however,"" the analyst said, ""that most of the 2002-2003 plants are already being built, so the benefit is mainly in 2004 and beyond."" 
There also is the chance of stock appreciation, even if the sector doesn't win back its growth moniker and the associated price-to-earnings multiples. According to Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, relative to expectations, some in the sector are not even trading at utility valuations, which means there is room to rise. 
Mullick favors El Paso Corp. (EP), which closed Friday at $41.77, and Williams Cos. (WMB), which ended the day at $25.50. Both stocks have come off the 52-week lows hit amid the heightened credit concerns last month, but the stocks remain sharply below their price ceilings. 
Investors said they were impressed by the ability of company managers to react to the new credit requirements. As a result, investors expect fourth-quarter conference calls to continue to stress debt reduction. 
The stocks could get a kick if the companies report they have been gaining market share in the wake of Enron's exit. This is most likely to come from market players such as Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), that had strong credit quality going into this period of uncertainty, some investors said. 
Going forward, Fleishman said he thinks it also is the companies with strong balance sheets that will be able to benefit from acquiring new assets on the cheap. He cited Duke, Entergy Corp. (ETR) and American Electric Power Corp. (AEP). 
The bottom line is most investors feel the short-term liquidity issues have been addressed, and now it is just a matter of waiting for energy prices to firm. 
""For the patient investor, the risk-reward looks pretty good,"" said Glen Hilton, portfolio manager at Montgomery Asset Management.

Business
Rhonda`s Roundtable
Rhonda Schaffler, Allan Chernoff

01/14/2002
CNNfn: Market Coverage - Morning
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.

RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: Welcome back to MARKET CALL. One of the many angles of the Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) mess is what is happening to the trading unit. 
Allan Chernoff has been following that story for us and he`s got an update.
Allan? 
ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT, MARKET CALL: Right. You know, Rhonda, the details of this were supposed to have been released at 8:30 this morning - they are now being pushed back to 3 p.m. But the ""Houston Chronicle,"" this morning, does have a report. And we understand from sources that it is a reliable source - reliable report - and in fact, the ""Chronicle"" is quoting Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon. 
So here is what the ""Houston Chronicle"" is reporting this morning in terms of the UBS (URL: http://www.ubs.com/) deal to buy Enron`s energy trading businesses. First of all, there will be no cash paid right up front and Enron will not have an ownership stake in the trading business. What will happen apparently, is that UBS is likely to give Enron 1/3 of the pre-tax profits from the energy trading business. That would be for year one and year two. And according to the report, in year three that would be pushed down if an option is exercised to 22 percent, then down to 11 percent, and then finally, down to zero percent. 
So again, the headline there is that he would be receiving 33 percent at the beginning. There you have all the details. Now apparently, UBS would be hiring most of the 800 traders and marketers that work at the Houston headquarters, and UBS would also be paying rent for the office space that it is using. 
So, Rhonda, that`s the latest that we have on that front. 
RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: All right, thanks so much, Allan. At least those people get it keep their jobs if we try to . 
CHERNOFF: We`ll see if it all happens. 
SCHAFFLER: Yes. Exactly. So 2 p.m. Eastern is when some more details . 
CHERNOFF: That`s when they`re releasing the details. Keep in mind, the judge still has to sign off on that. Originally, he was supposed to do that Tuesday. It was then pushed off to Thursday, and now it`s Friday. 
SCHAFFLER: OK. With that, we kick off the Roundtable. Andy Serwer of ""Fortune"" is here and our guest host, Todd Eberhard, joins me as well. 
Andy, what`s on your mind this morning? 
ANDY SERWER, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, ""FORTUNE"": Well, you know, here we go again with the negative sentiment own Wall Street, sort of a real bearish morning. Rich Bernstein at Merrill Lynch cutting that firm`s allocation of stocks and very important downgrades. Over at Lehman, one report, I think, is really having a negative effect comes out of S&P. It concerns corporate bankruptcies. 
Not a surprise, 2001 was a record for corporate bankruptcies; 211 companies worldwide declaring bankruptcy; $115 billion of debt. Here`s what struck me, though: It breaks the old record of 2,000, when 132 companies declared bankruptcy for $43 billion. So we went from $43 billion to $115 billion. And, you know, last year we had Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) and PG&E (URL: http://www.pgecorp.com/) in California, you know, the utilities. So, are we going to go for a trifecta (ph) this year? Let`s hope now. That is a tremendous jump in two years in a row, records like that. So, not having a good effect on the Street. 
SCHAFFLER: And, of course, there are all these scattered, you know, rumors out there, whether it`s K-Mart (URL: http://www.kmart.com/) seems to be the one in focus as a possible company that could go next. But, those are clearly alarming figures. And if things don`t turn around . 
TODD EBERHARD, GUEST HOST, MARKET CALL: Well, that`s the question: Are we now through the worst for - into `02 or the first half of `02. It may continue to be bad, but is the second half going to turn around. And if you start to see a lessening in those bankruptcies and start to see a turnaround in some corporate profits, I mean, that becomes a statistics from the bygone era, to a degree, and maybe focus forward, not backward. 
SCHAFFLER: There`s a lot of maybes in there. 
EBERHARD: Well, yes. It`s true. 
SCHAFFLER: Did you catch that? 
CHERNOFF: And, the Street really is worried about what happens going forward. 
EBERHARD: Sure. 
CHERNOFF: I mean, we`re not - we know that we`ve had an awful year. We know that the recession is always under way. We know there are a lot of bankruptcies. The story is, do we turn around in terms of profits? 
SERWER: And the problem is, again - that we keep wrestling with here over the past couple days - is we`ve already come back so far from the Nader in late September. And now the feeling is we`ve gone too far, we`ve gotten ahead of ourselves. Holly Becker of Lehman Brothers downgrading eBay (URL: http://www.ebay.com/) this morning for just that kind of reason. She`s saying, take profits. This thing is back up. It`s up. It`s the only Internet stock that matters. It`s the only Internet stock that has held 
up. 
CHERNOFF: Well, it`s the best run Internet company bar none, by far. 
SERWER: Right, right, and the stock reflects that. 
CHERNOFF: And we`re not going to include AOL Time Warner (URL: http://www.aol.com/) as an Internet company. 
SCHAFFLER: Oh, Allan. That would be like unplugging this media company . 
SERWER: ""CBS MarketWatch"" had a report this morning on their Web site rating the AOL Time Warner, giving it a ""D."" 
SCHAFFLER: For what? 
SERWER: For just performance - and compared it to Disney (URL: http://www.disney.com/) . It compared it to the HHH, which is the Merrill Lynch Internet index, and said that it lagged all those. And so, the one-year anniversary, good folks at ""CBS MarketWatch"" gave AOL Time Warner a ""D."" 
SCHAFFLER: Even with all the great inflation out there these days. 
CHERNOFF: The good competitors . 
SERWER: Yes. 
SCHAFFLER: There you go. 
SERWER: There`s a connection with Viacom (URL: http://www.viacom.com/) there, too, if my understanding is correct. 
SCHAFFLER: You know, Todd, if we`re in this situation here where we`re raising these questions: hey, when is it going to get better? Have we gone up too far? The market can really stagnate for months. I hate to raise that point, but if it doesn`t go down it can also go nowhere. 
EBERHARD: That`s a perfect example of what I think we`ve seen over the last week or two, to some degree. I mean, we`ve seen pullback, but I have to argue the other side for a second. With all this bad news on Enron, with all the bad news coming out of Ford Motor (URL: http://www.ford.com/) with layoffs, with all the bad news of all the dot-coms and everything else that occurred over the last 18 months, let`s call it, and the market getting killed, we have seen it stagnate, which is not a bad thing, to find that bottom, theoretically. 
SCHAFFLER: That would be our base building? 
EBERHARD: In theory, yes. You find that base building and then it builds from there. And it may take three months, six months to get really going again or maybe even longer. But at least it`s not heading lower with all the bad news coming out at this point. 
SERWER: Well, that`s sort of like having . 
SCHAFFLER: A positive spin. 
SERWER: Yes. How do you analyze Greenspan`s speech on Friday? Was it a half-empty speech? 
EBERHARD: That`s right. 
SERWER: A glass half-empty or a glass half-full? You know, he said, well, I don`t see any real signs on recovery. On the other hand, things aren`t getting worse, basically. You know, It`s hard for me to really sit here and see the market doing a whole lot first half of the year. I mean, I hate to say it but . 
SCHAFFLER: Yes. See? That`s what I`m wondering, too, because it just seems in the last week we had a couple of brokerages coming out and just 
saying, you know, in this particular group, valuations looked like they got ahead of themselves. Wireless, for instance, there was another wireless downgrade today. So it looks like there`s pockets where people are saying, all right, 100 percent recovery since September is enough. 
CHERNOFF: Rhonda, I really don`t buy what these brokerage analysts write at all. The bottom line is . 
EBERHARD: Allan . 
CHERNOFF: If you get a few companies coming out with halfway decent news, people are going to back in there bidding them up. It`s as simple as that. 
EBERHARD: Do you mean these guys who said that the dot-coms were going to go on forever and ever? 
CHERNOFF: Yes. 
SERWER: No, no, the guys who said that Enron was a buy. Those guys. 
EBERHARD: Oh, those guys. 
CHERNOFF: Oh! 
SCHAFFLER: That would be all of them, I think. 
CHERNOFF: They worked across the hall from here. 
SERWER: Absolutely. 
EBERHARD: It`s true, though. What you`re saying is accurate. If one or two companies do start to show numbers, and look at Intel (URL: http://www.intel.com/) , going back a short time ago; they came out with an OK number or ""we think we`re doing better,"" and all of a sudden we`re off to the races again. And there`s a lot of cash out there to be placed, eventually. It may not be tomorrow or the next day. But, eventually, we will enter . 
SCHAFFLER: Nobody will want to miss that rally. So basically, we need somebody, right, where even though there are no fundamentals here and technically the stock is in bad shape, buy it anyway? That would make you happy? 
CHERNOFF: If there`s some halfway decent news, I think you`ll get people just jumping in once again. The turn is here. The turn`s here. 
SCHAFFLER: Last call, Andy. You`re first. 
SERWER: More fallout from Enron. I mean, it just permeates. Northern Trust (URL: http://www.ntrs.com/) , the big Chicago bank, today saying its earnings are down 18 percent. Big exposure to Enron is the reason why there is a write-off there. Stock`s not doing too badly. It still has a pretty high multiple. But we`ll see things like this happen. 
SCHAFFLER: Allan? 
CHERNOFF: Well, Rhonda, we certainly want to pay attention to what happens here with the UBS deal, but also the House Energy and Commerce Committee is really the focus of where the action is right now. They`re the ones who uncovered this memo, apparently, that had been issued by an in-house lawyer at Andersen to tell people, you can get rid of some of those documents. More details are definitely going to be coming out very shortly. 
SCHAFFLER: And they will be interesting. That`s for sure. 
Todd? 
EBERHARD: I think we will see more details and more hiccups on this Enron, as well as other deals that go on, and other people who are connected with it. But I think the market has absorbed most of it. So I`m not too concerned about that affecting valuations at this level. 
SCHAFFLER: That is our roundtable. ""MARKET CALL"" continues. 
In the next hour, we head back to the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq to find out what stocks are moving at this hour. President Bush visits America`s heartland to talk about the economy. And Microsoft has 
plenty of cash on happened, but should that money go to paying out dividends? 
We`ll explore that on our ""Tough Call"" segment.

FRANKFURT -- After a tricky 2001, European banks could find life getting tougher still in 2002. 
Banking analysts say a combination of economic stagnation, rising corporate bankruptcies and low confidence among retail investors is likely to hurt many banks' earnings in the coming year.
Since mid-2000, when the U.S. economic slowdown spread to Europe -- and in particular to its largest economy, Germany -- European banks have tried to reassure investors about their corporate clients' credit-worthiness. Although banks in the United Kingdom, France and elsewhere have had to set aside only modest amounts to cover bad loans so far, loan-loss provisions were partly responsible for quarterly operating losses among some of Germany's biggest banks. Now the fear is that the German syndrome will spread. 
""The asset-quality downturn has only just started,"" says Mark Hoge, an analyst at Bank of America in London. So far, he says, the global economic downturn has pushed only a small number of weak or heavily indebted companies into bankruptcy or financial crisis, such as energy trader Enron Corp. and Swissair Group. The next stage will be loan defaults by small and midsize companies, which form the backbone of several European economies, including Germany's. ""You will get a broad deterioration of the bread-and-butter lending business next year,"" he says. 
European banks have as much as six trillion euros ($5.3 trillion) of loans outstanding, and next year they are likely to lose about 38 billion euros of those assets, or 0.73%, according to Davide Serra, a Morgan Stanley analyst in London. That is three times as high as in the past three to four years, but historically speaking, it is still a low figure. In the recession of the late 1980s and early 1990s, banks wrote off over 1% of loans. Still, Mr. Serra says the impact of bad loans is severe: Every 0.1% of loans written off reduces European banks' profit by 5% to 6%. 
Banks could suffer if troubles at indebted large corporations multiply. In the past year, business fortunes collapsed rapidly at a small number of high-profile companies, including airlines Swissair and Sabena and telecommunications-equipment maker Marconi PLC. German bankers are growing nervous that the heavy debts of Bavarian media company Kirch Group could trigger the next emergency restructuring. 
The number and impact of large corporate collapses are ""a lumpy phenomenon that you can't forecast in a systematic way,"" Mr. Serra says. Corporate failures tend to lag behind economic slowdowns by 12 to 18 months -- which means they are likely to rise in Europe next year, he says. 
Many of Europe's banks have been trying to reduce their reliance on traditional corporate lending by expanding into asset management and retail brokerage activities. Two years ago, it looked as though Europeans' newfound enthusiasm for buying stocks, including those in high-profile privatizations and technology industries, would give the region's banks the new source of nonloan revenue they were seeking. But a generation of first-time retail investors learned a lesson in risk when the tech bubble burst earlier this year. 
Europe is still expected to develop a U.S.-style equity investing culture over time, driven in particular by the growth of a long-term savings market as Europeans move to private pension funds. The Jan. 1 introduction of euro notes and coins will create a pan-European financial-services market over time. But for the moment, Europeans have fallen out of love with stocks, as shown by the depressed earnings of brokerage and funds units at most European banks in 2001. 
Analyst don't expect investor confidence to return quickly. John Leonard, an analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London, compares the situation to the U.S. in the year after the stock-market crash of 1987, when retail investors' losses made them wary of returning to the fray even after the first signs of recovery. 
Fear of getting involved in troubled banking markets could also keep the U.K.'s banks on the sidelines, despite their long search for European partners. Lloyds TSB in particular has long talked about a European merger and has held advanced but inconclusive talks during the past year with the Benelux-based insurance and banking group Fortis NV and Germany's Deutsche Bank AG, according to people familiar with the matter. But Lloyds's shareholders are likely to be skeptical about a deal that would mix up the banks' relatively robust earnings in the U.K. retail market with the problems spreading across Europe. 
Opportunities for European deals in the coming year appear scarce. A foreign bid for a French bank such as Societe Generale SA would be highly sensitive amid France's presidential election campaign, for example. Germany's faltering economy makes its banks unappealing. 
""You would really need your head examined to be buying into something like Commerzbank in a recession in Germany when you don't know how long it's going to last,"" says Mr. Hoge of Bank of America.

Great Expectations: Did Greenspan Push High-Tech Optimism On Growth Too Far? --- Some He Won Over at Fed Have Second Thoughts; At Stake: Interest Rates --- Bank Took `a Bit of a Risk'
By Greg Ip and Jacob M. Schlesinger

WASHINGTON -- Five years ago, Alan Greenspan began pushing a reluctant Federal Reserve to embrace his New Economy vision of rapid productivity growth and rising living standards. 
Today, Fed policy makers are debating whether they went too far. The answer could help determine whether the current recession marks a temporary aberration in an era of swift growth, or whether the rapid growth of the late 1990s itself was the aberration.
Mr. Greenspan hasn't lost the faith. ""New capital investment, especially the high-tech type, will continue where it left off,"" he declared in a speech last month at Rice University in Houston. He ignored the collapse of so many symbols of the 1990s boom, including Enron Corp., the sponsor of the ""distinguished public service"" award he received that evening. ""The long-term outlook for productivity growth, as far as I'm concerned, remains substantially undiminished,"" the Fed chairman asserted. 
But others at the central bank -- many of whom only belatedly embraced their leader's optimistic views at the peak of the boom -- now have re-embraced a less-sanguine view. During 2001, the Fed's research staff has steadily marked down its estimate of the rate at which the economy can grow during the next two years without sparking inflation. The economic aftermath of Sept. 11 has only darkened the picture further, as companies shift resources away from boosting efficiency and toward improving security. 
Recent events have ""forced a reassessment of the prospects for longer-term productivity growth,"" Fed governor Laurence Meyer said in a relatively downbeat speech in St. Louis just two weeks after Mr. Greenspan's sunny comments in Houston. Where Mr. Greenspan emphasized the prospect of a healthy rebound in computers, Mr. Meyer stressed that the ""frenzied pace of investment in high-tech equipment [in the late 1990s] now appears to have been unsustainable."" 
The exchange between Messrs. Greenspan and Meyer signals an intellectual contest at the Fed with huge stakes. If the buoyant Greenspan view prevails, the Fed might hold down interest rates longer, until strong growth resumes, not fearing a flare-up of inflation. The gloomier perspective could lead the Fed to raise rates more quickly to avoid fueling inflation -- or reinflating a bubble -- with expectations of brisk growth. 
The Fed's outlook also matters for congressional decisions on taxes and spending. Mr. Greenspan's assurances of a rapid-growth future helped create a consensus in Washington earlier this year about the inevitability of large federal budget surpluses -- and the affordability of President Bush's big tax cuts. 
The Fed's growth debate amounts to an argument over what kind of economy America can look forward to once the recession ends: one of rapidly rising living standards, low inflation, low interest rates, and federal budgets in reasonable balance -- like that in most of the 1950s and 1960s -- or a much-less-robust version. 
Mr. Greenspan's contention -- that since 1995, the U.S. has shown the ability to expand productivity at an accelerated rate, without demand for goods and services outrunning supply and igniting inflation -- is now so widely accepted as to seem mundane. But just five or six years ago, it was considered revolutionary. Mr. Greenspan was one of the first respected analysts to make the case. 
The key to this whole discussion is productivity, which economists define as a worker's -- or nation's -- output, divided by the relevant number of hours of labor. The pace of growth in gross domestic product is essentially equivalent to the productivity-growth rate added to the rate of expansion of the labor force (which economists assume to be about 1% a year). 
As far back as 1993, Mr. Greenspan has said, he noted a surprising surge in companies' capital-goods orders. He speculated that companies were enjoying unusual gains in productivity, or efficiency, from the new equipment, much of which was high-tech. As his conjecture hardened into conviction, he concluded the greater productivity would permit the economy to grow faster without demand getting out of sync with supply. The Fed could hold back on raising rates longer without fear of fueling inflation. 
Alan Blinder, who challenged the central bank's high-rates stance when he joined the seven-member Fed board as vice chairman in 1994, was pleasantly surprised by Mr. Greenspan's switch to endorsing lower rates in 1995. But Mr. Blinder was nervous about the chairman's reasoning. At a Fed policy meeting in December 1995, Mr. Blinder backed Mr. Greenspan's bottom line on interest levels -- but ""without signing onto your brave new world scenario,"" according to official transcripts of the gathering. 
Mr. Meyer, an economic forecaster and consultant who joined the Fed in 1996, was uncomfortable with the low-interest-rate approach and the Greenspan notion that basic changes in the economy would allow it to grow faster without sparking inflation. In a January 1998 speech, he branded the prior year's growth spurt ""unsustainable."" 
The Fed's own research staff had Greenspan doubters. Economist Daniel Sichel's 1997 book, ""The Computer Revolution,"" punctured tales of companies using new technology to boost workers' productivity to permanently higher levels. Mr. Sichel crunched numbers to show that for all the attention computers received in the 1990s, they represented such a tiny portion of the nation's capital stock -- 1.1% -- that they couldn't possibly make a big difference. 
In their internal forecasts during most of the 1990s, the Fed staff argued that the economy couldn't average overall growth of much more than 2.5% a year without kindling inflation. The problem for the staff and other Greenspan skeptics was that Commerce Department estimates of actual annual growth for 1996, 1997 and 1998 were, respectively, 3.6%, 4.4% and 4.3% -- while inflation remained dormant. 
Michael Prell, who ran the Fed's research department during this period, tried to explain much of the high overall growth rates as a function of temporary factors, not new efficiencies. Perhaps, he argued to colleagues, companies were coaxing more output from their workers simply because the companies couldn't hire quickly enough. 
A member of the bank's rate-setting committee skeptically attributed a portion of the growth rates to employees ""running to the elevators"": Workers at companies meeting heavy customer demand were simply exerting themselves more, the official told colleagues. This wasn't a fundamental change, the committee member said. It was a temporary phenomenon that would taper off as the economy inevitably cooled. 
Outsiders also attacked the Greenspan view. At a meeting the chairman hosted in April 1999, Paul Romer, a Stanford University economist, displayed a chart of productivity during the past 100 years. ""People in Silicon Valley are talking about hockey-stick growth curves,"" compared with the 1970s and 1980s, Prof. Romer recalls telling the attendees. But in fact, the improvement of the previous three years wasn't such a historical anomaly, he pointed out. The U.S. had racked up even more impressive growth rates in the 1960s. 
Mr. Greenspan didn't confront Mr. Romer at the time. The chairman rarely, if ever, engaged doubters directly in debate. Instead, at policy meetings, he periodically pointed out how frequently in-house forecasters' projections in the late 1990s had failed to match subsequent actual growth and inflation figures, according to people in attendance. 
But gradually, current and former Fed governors and staff members say, they found the views he advocated harder to resist. As Mr. Greenspan's fellow policy makers understood it, his pitch was that the central bank should give his optimistic perspective a chance. ""The question was whether or not we should sort of take a bit of a risk,"" recalls Fed governor Edward Kelley, who is set to step down at the end of the month, after 14 years with the bank. The gamble, he explains, was to let the Greenspan theory ""run, and see if this thing is going to be real and have some legs and keep allowing us, for a while at least, to have a very strong [growth rate] and a declining inflation rate."" 
The Fed traditionally seeks consensus in fashioning monetary policy. Over the four-year period from 1996 through 1999, Mr. Greenspan persuaded his colleagues, first, not to raise interest rates, and then, when rate increases became inevitable because of inflation fears, to institute them more slowly than many would have wanted. 
Beyond making arguments, Mr. Greenspan helped generate more empirical support for his perspective by pushing an effort to adjust official data that most economists agreed had grown obsolete. After getting a private presentation in the summer of 1996 from Mr. Greenspan and two of his aides, Commerce Department officials accelerated their plans to revise output figures for sectors such as banking. Until the change, the official numbers hadn't shown any improvement in efficiency for banks in the 1990s, despite the proliferation of automatic-teller machines that so obviously allowed branches to conduct more transactions per worker. 
In another initiative, Fed staffers in 1998 created their own tech-industry database, which provided an authoritative account of the accelerating drop in semiconductor prices, beginning in 1995. Economists interpreted the information as a strong sign that chip companies were able to cut prices because they had increased productivity. The new Fed information also suggested that prices of the machines that use semiconductors -- computers -- were also falling, which many economists reasoned would encourage companies to buy more computers. 
""When the Fed began to look at these numbers, the scales fell away from everybody's eyes,"" says Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson. Computers clearly had become more prevalent since the Fed's Mr. Sichel found them to be such a small fraction of the nation's capital stock. Based on the new data, Mr. Jorgenson published in August 2000 one of the first papers by a respected academic recognizing the contribution of computers to higher growth. 
Mr. Greenspan avidly sought evidence that companies had only barely begun employing new technologies to raise efficiency and pump up productivity. At meetings and cocktail parties, he would sometimes draw a graph on paper representing the spread of tech innovations, and then ask business executives to plot where their companies stood in exploiting these new technologies. 
In a meeting at the Fed's headquarters in the summer of 1999, he prodded officials from the National Association of Purchasing Management to include in their semiannual survey of executives a question about the remaining potential for applying new technologies. They did, and the survey repeatedly found that managers thought they had exploited only half of the potential of high-tech -- a figure Mr. Greenspan then invoked regularly in speeches and congressional testimony to back his claims. 
Mr. Greenspan bombarded his colleagues with anecdotes supporting his view that the economy had fundamentally changed. In October 1995, a group of supply managers from various industries visited the Fed to discuss the latest in high-efficiency ""just-in-time"" inventory management. Mr. Kelley, the retiring Fed governor and a former businessman, refers to himself as ""an old inventory manager."" He recalls that one of the visiting supply executives described routing goods to drugstores: ""They would load a truck up and without having orders, send the truck out. The drugstore computer system would call the supplier, which would call the truck on the road and say, `Go to such-and-such store and deliver the following items.'"" To Mr. Kelley, hearing about this slick system ""was like going to Mars."" 
By 1999, the official statistics were consistently reflecting the trends that Mr. Greenspan had talked about for several years. Inflation stayed calm even as growth surged. And by then, the bulk of the Fed -- from Mr. Kelley and other policy makers to the staff -- had been converted to New Economy believers, too. 
The once-skeptical Mr. Meyer confessed in a speech in September 1999 that ""we can confidently say . . . that, since 1995, actual productivity growth has increased."" At the time, he suggested that he believed the economy could annually grow overall by as much as 3% without inciting inflation, up from his longtime prior estimate of a 2.5% limit. Soon thereafter, he indicated that perhaps the right number was 3.5% to 4%. Mr. Sichel, the researcher who had cast doubt on the significance of computers to productivity, co-wrote a paper published in 2000 that said the prevalence of computers had sharply increased, and they were contributing significantly to productivity growth. 
While the doubters were coming around to Mr. Greenspan's basic point of view -- that the economy's speed limit had risen -- the Fed chairman seemed to move even farther out on the limb. At an April 2000 White House conference on the New Economy, he appeared to raise his already-upbeat opinion of how much better the economy could perform. ""I see no reason that productivity growth cannot remain elevated, or even increase further,"" he said. 
Still, Mr. Greenspan is a master politician, as skilled as any Washington figure at hedging his bets and covering himself for all eventualities. While his rhetoric often sounds giddy, he has assiduously avoided ever giving a concrete number -- even to fellow Fed officials -- for maximum sustainable growth. He also often qualifies his more-effusive statements to concede that his high-tech growth theory could be wrong. In one speech in January 2000, he acknowledged that future historians ""might well conclude that a good deal of what we are currently experiencing was just one of the many euphoric speculative bubbles that have dotted human history."" 
And yet, so persuaded were Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues of his optimistic outlook that they seemed to have trouble accepting the bursting of the high-tech bubble when it happened last year. As business investment weakened in late 2000, Fed officials told one another that technology had proven so valuable to companies that they would likely resume higher purchasing levels soon, Fed minutes show. 
The staff forecast prepared for the December 2000 policy meeting predicted that consumer spending would slow because of falling stock-market wealth. But ""business fixed investment, notably outlays for equipment and software, was projected to remain relatively robust,"" according to the minutes. Mr. Greenspan himself was taken aback in October 2000 by a chart accompanying an article in The Wall Street Journal that showed a huge gap between the rapid growth of fiber-optic capacity and the much-slower growth of demand for the technology, a discrepancy that soon led to the collapse of a raft of start-up broadband companies. 
Early this year, the Fed was cutting interest rates in an effort to keep growth from stalling, while still issuing upbeat statements about the New Economy. ""To date there is little evidence to suggest that longer-term advances in technology and associated gains in productivity are abating,"" the central bank's policy makers said after the first rate cut in early January. 
Some economists now say that because Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues believed so fervently in the fundamental benefits of technology, they didn't recognize that much high-tech spending in the late 1990s was wasted. ""Virtually no one, official or outside [the Fed] was talking about the fact that high stock prices were essentially generating too much investment"" by businesses in high-tech gear, says Stephen Cecchetti, head of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1997 to 1999 and now an economics professor at Ohio State University. 
But as capital spending continued to collapse this winter and spring, the Fed research department's models showed that the economy's potential to grow over the next two years was slipping to about 3% from its estimate of more than 4% in early 2000. (The economists made clear this didn't necessarily affect the longer-run outlook.) 
At the bank's June 2001 policy meeting, time was set aside for special staff presentations on the most recent evidence on productivity and the tech glut. The researchers still agreed with Mr. Greenspan's assertion that productivity was going to be stronger than it had been from 1973 through 1995, but they now said that ""how much stronger was an open question,"" according to the minutes. 
As companies have continued to work off excessive inventories for nearly a year, some Fed officials now believe they placed too much faith in such New Economy tenets as the idea that better supply management could make long downturns less likely. ""It has turned out we have had a more-severe economic cycle than I thought we would,"" says Mr. Kelley. ""It has so far looked more like the old days,"" he says, referring to recessions of past decades. 
In July, it emerged that the statistical foundation of the Greenspan view hadn't been as impressive as it once seemed. Government statisticians recalculated their official estimates for output and productivity in the late 1990s after discovering they had overestimated software sales. For 2000, the overall growth rate was knocked down from an eye-popping 5% to 4.1%. 
The economy's turn-of-the-century performance ""was still impressive,"" Mr. Meyer said in his speech in late November. But ""it was less exceptional than it had appeared before."" 
The big question now is which view of the economy's potential performance will prevail in coming years. If a new pessimism takes root at the central bank -- if officials come to regret their Greenspan-inspired experiment of the 1990s -- the Fed may be more inclined to rein in growth. If the influential chairman maintains his optimism and that of his colleagues, the bank may try harder to restore the 1990s boom.

Could've Been Worse
By PAUL KRUGMAN

12/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 19, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

It has not been a good year for economic policy, at home or abroad. The best you can say is that things could have been worse. 
The bad news was legion. The U.S. went into recession, and the collapse of Enron raised questions not only about our economy but about the state of business ethics. We squandered our hard-won budget surplus, and with it our best chance to do something about the fiscal burdens of an aging population, on an ill-conceived tax cut. Overseas, Argentina melted down -- something I had long predicted, but the actual events were still shocking. And Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, looks less like Franklin Roosevelt and more like Herbert Hoover every day.
The good news all takes the form of things that didn't happen. 
The good news about the U.S. economy is that it fell into recession, but it didn't fall off a cliff. Most of the credit probably goes to the dogged optimism of American consumers, but the Fed's dramatic interest rate cuts helped keep housing strong even as business investment plunged. The pain is far from over -- unemployment looks set to keep on rising, even if the G.D.P. starts growing again -- but our worst fears have not been realized. 
It was good news that the World Trade Organization didn't collapse. Trade is one area in which the Bush administration is right and the Democrats are wrong; but there was a real risk that the 1999 debacle in Seattle, where an attempt to start a new round of negotiations collapsed in disarray, would be repeated this year. In fact the meeting, in Doha, Qatar, went off fairly well. Alas, I cannot take any satisfaction in the passage of ''fast track'' trade authority: as Lael Brainard pointed out on this page yesterday, the Bush administration purchased fast-track at the cost of appalling concessions to special interests, concessions that hurt the very countries free trade is supposed to help. 
It was good news when California's energy crisis evaporated, thanks to price controls and conservation. The Bush administration was all set to use the crisis to push through an environmentally destructive program of corporate welfare, which had nothing to do with the actual problem; the sudden surplus of power put that plan on hold. 
Really big good news: To my immense relief, the absurdity of Social Security privatization became manifest before the system had been dismantled. I had been really worried about that; the Bush administration's claim that private accounts would improve rather than worsen the system's finances made no sense at all, yet it got a free pass from most commentators. 
Fortunately, the commission that was supposed to propose a detailed plan came to a farcical end. Its final report declared that private accounts would indeed strengthen Social Security, if they were accompanied by sharp benefit cuts and huge financial injections from unspecified sources. Yes, and eating a jelly doughnut every morning will help you lose weight, if you also cut back sharply on other foods and do a lot of exercise; otherwise the doughnuts will make you fatter. Again, aren't you glad the absurdity of the Bush proposal came to light before $1 trillion was diverted into private accounts? 
And one more thing to be grateful for: We didn't get a stimulus bill. That doesn't sound like good news, unless you look at the content of the bills that were actually on the table: huge further tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy, doing little for the economy but further worsening our already dreary fiscal outlook. 
But what about the year ahead? 
For me the gloomiest moment was probably around mid-October. That's when the straight economics looked worst -- when the impact of Sept. 11 on confidence seemed all too likely to turn the recession into something truly nasty. It was also the moment when some politicians decided to abandon all restraint, and throw their weight behind huge special-interest giveaways. But guess what? Confidence didn't collapse, and the special interests didn't get what they wanted. It turns out that there are still decent politicians, in both parties, and so far they have had enough power -- just -- to prevent the worst. 
In short, things could have been worse, and there is still reason to hope. Happy New Year.

JDS Set the Record, but It May Not Be 2001's Biggest Loser
By FLOYD NORRIS

12/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

CALL it the year of good will gone bad. Never in history has so much in intangible assets been wiped off balance sheets as companies were forced to acknowledge that they had made some very bad acquisitions. 
But records are made to be broken, and accountants and appraisers say that companies are lining up to announce huge write-offs in 2002.
Until this year, the worst annual performance for an American corporation was the $23.5 billion loss posted by General Motors in 1992, largely because of an accounting change that forced it to recognize the costs of health care for retired workers. But that record was smashed by JDS Uniphase, which lost $56.1 billion in its fiscal year that ended June 30. Of that, more than $51 billion came from writing off the costs of bad acquisitions and investments. 
As a symbol of the age, that was perfect. When G.M. set the record, it was an American icon, and its net loss that year came to just one-sixth of its annual revenue. JDS Uniphase, a maker of telecommunications equipment, is not known to most Americans, and for good reason. Its 2001 loss was about 10 times as large as its lifetime revenue. 
JDS never saw $50 billion in cash, but it could lose that much because it was blessed, for a time, with an overvalued stock, which it used to buy overpriced companies. After the bubble burst, the accountants acted as if JDS had spent real money. 
Another 2001 record breaker, Enron, did spend real money. Its bankruptcy set the record as the largest in American history in terms of assets. It managed to go broke without ever reporting a bad quarter, at least not as measured by the ''pro forma'' earnings that Wall Street relied upon until it was too late. 
Enron will now report huge losses. And, reports Alfred King, the co-chairman of the Valuation Research Corporation, it will not be alone. 
''A lot of write-downs are coming'' early in 2002 and will involve hundreds of billions of dollars, Mr. King told a recent New York University seminar on the new merger accounting rule that has just taken effect. Appraisal firms like his have been inundated with business from companies seeking advice on how much to write off. 
The rule says good will from mergers must be written off if the business unit containing the acquired company is worth less than book value, including the good will taken on as part of the acquisition. Companies have some leeway in determining whether a write-off is needed, but it appears that many of them want to take their write-offs quickly, when they can blame a change in accounting rules. 
After the 2002 baths are taken, the usefulness of the new merger rule for investors will depend on whether it forces companies to take losses quickly when a deal goes wrong, or whether companies can postpone the bad news until years later, after problems are clear to all. 
There is a sense in which JDS did not suffer 2001's largest loss, nor did Enron. The biggest loss of good will may have been suffered by the accounting profession. The Big Five accounting firms are clearly worried, and they are scrambling to come up with a quick fix to improve disclosures of off-balance sheet debts, related-party transactions and market risks relative to commodity prices. In other words, all the things that Enron hid until it collapsed. 
The worry among accountants is that investors who were willing to shrug off accounting scandals during the bull market may now be less tolerant. Whether that proves to be the case will be one thing to watch in 2002.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR - Power traders necessary for efficiency.
By BERNARD WEINSTEIN.

12/28/2001
Financial Times

From Prof Bernard L. Weinstein. 
The collapse of Enron is a serious blow to its employees and to the city of Houston. But claims by some politicians and pundits that the electric power industry does not need such companies to make a market are ridiculous. For consumers and businesses to get full benefit from deregulation and retail competition, the activities of power traders such as Enron, Dynegy, Calpine and Reliant are critical.
Enron may have overreached and made strategic blunders but this is often the case when a formerly regulated industry restructures and one company attempts to ""get ahead of the curve"". Braniff Airlines is one example. When the airlines were deregulated in the early 1980s, Braniff pursued a programme of rapid domestic and international expansion. Unable to generate sufficient passenger revenue to cover its higher fixed costs and operating expenses, Braniff went bankrupt in two years. Southwest Airlines took a more deliberate approach to route expansion and became the most profitable airline in the US. The trucking and telecommunications industries have also witnessed dramatic failures by companies growing too fast, too soon after deregulation. Trucking giant McLean raced ahead of the pack during the initial impetus of deregulation in 1980, only to collapse several years later. A similar fate befell ClayDesta Communications, which aspired to become a rival to AT&T during the early years of telecoms deregulation. As with other restructurings, it will take time for the electric power industry to sort itself out. This has been the case in Britain, where the push for competitive power markets began in the late 1980s. Few gains were recorded in the first years but by the mid-1990s consumers and businesses began to reap significant benefits. Today, electricity prices are down a third and about 30 per cent of customers have switched providers. Unfortunately, some state legislatures are citing the Enron case as a reason to slow down or derail electric power deregulation, while Congress is considering legislation severely to restrict the activities of power traders. Such measures would be a serious mistake. Power traders are the ""middlemen"" who make markets work and ensure they operate efficiently. Spot purchases and sales can spread lower power costs across a wide geographic market in the short term while traders who sell long-term contracts reduce risks for utilities and ratepayers by providing price certainty. Enron may or may not survive as a corporate entity. But a vibrant market for power trading remains the key to ensuring that utilities, businesses and customers benefit from deregulation and competition in electricity.

Commentary An Enron Tale of Strange Bedfellows
ALEXANDER COCKBURN

The fall of Enron sounds the death knell for one of the great rackets of the last decade: the ""Green Guys"" seal of approval, whereby some outfit such as the Natural Resources Defense Council or the Environmental Defense Fund would issue testimonials to the enviro-conscience and selfless devotion to the public weal of corporations such as Enron. This approbation was part and parcel of the neoliberal pitch that fuddy-duddy regulation should yield to modern, ""market-oriented"" inducements to environmental good behavior, and the NRDC and EDF were the prime salespeople. 
The NRDC's deep involvement with the Enron lobby machine is a case in point. Here's what happened: In 1997, high-flying Enron was in a pitched battle in Oregon, where it planned to acquire Portland General Electric, the state's largest public utility. Warning that Enron's motives were of a highly predatory nature, the Public Utilities Commission staff opposed the merger. They warned that an Enron takeover would mean less protection for the environment, increased insecurity for Portland General's workers and, likely, soaring prices. There also was the issue of decommissioning Portland General's Trojan nuclear plant.
Other critics argued that Enron's actual plan was to cannibalize Portland General, in particular its hydropower, which Enron would sell in California's energy market. 
But as such protests threatened to deprive Enron of its prize, into town rode the NRDC's top energy commissar, Ralph Cavanagh, flaunting his ties to the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based outfit providing the financial wattage for many citizen and environmental groups. Cavanagh lost no time in whipping the refractory greens of Oregon into line. In concert with Enron, he put together a memo of understanding that pledged that the company would lend financial support to some of these groups' pet projects. But he had arduous politicking ahead. Approval for the merger had to come from the PUC, whose staff was opposed. So, on Feb. 14, 1997, Cavanagh showed up at a hearing in Salem, Ore., to plead Enron's case. 
Addressing the PUC, he averred that this was ""the first time I've ever spoken in support of a utility merger."" If so, it was one of the quickest transitions from virginity to seasoned performance in the history of intellectual prostitution. Cavanagh touted the delights of an embrace with Enron: ""What we've put before you with this company is ... a robust assortment of public benefits for the citizens of Oregon, which would not emerge without the merger."" He then moved into rhetorical high gear: ""The Oregonian [newspaper] asks the question, 'Can you trust Enron?' On stewardship issues and public benefit issues, I've dealt with this company for a decade, often in the most contentious circumstances, and the answer is, yes."" 
The PUC approved the merger, and it wasn't long before the darkest suspicions about Enron's plans were vindicated. The company raised rates, tried to soak ratepayers with the cost of its failed Trojan nuclear reactor and moved to put some of the company's most valuable assets on the block. 
Enron's motive had indeed been to get access to the hydropower of the Northwest, the cheapest in the country, and to sell it in the California market, the priciest and, in part because of Cavanagh's campaigning for deregulation, the ripest for exploitation. Two years later, the company Cavanagh had hailed as ""engaged, motivated and committed"" put Portland General on the auction block. 
Today, some House Republicans want to treat the Enron collapse as a criminal matter, while Democrats talk about cleaning up accounting rules and plugging holes in the regulatory system. The outrage over the inability of Enron employees to sell company stock from their 401(k) plans while higher-ups absconded with millions may doom President Bush's promised onslaught on Social Security. 
There are many morals in Enron's collapse, and the role of the Green Guys seal of approval shouldn't be forgotten.

Despite the Shock, Davis Kept the Lights On

Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

Re ""Let Consumers Shop for Cheaper Energy,"" Commentary, Dec. 20: Fixated as he is on nit-picking Gov. Gray Davis' solutions to the energy crisis, Tom McClintock misses the most vital fact: The governor's quick and aggressive actions kept the lights on. He protected ratepayers from the brunt of the outrageous price manipulations of the out-of-state generators. He secured a reliable energy supply for the state's long-term future and goaded the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission into waking to its legal role as a regulator. 
McClintock says Davis didn't lift a finger to deal with skyrocketing natural gas prices, forgetting, apparently, that gas prices dropped only after President Bush agreed to the governor's call for an investigation last spring.
He forgets that it was not Davis who froze customer rates. That freeze was part of the original deregulation law. The utilities wholeheartedly supported the freeze because the rate allowed them to make substantial profits for several years. In opposing large retail rate increases, Davis stated firmly that residential customers hadn't asked for deregulation, hadn't wanted it and shouldn't be victims of its failure. 
McClintock claims that left alone, energy prices would have settled down. Yet he fails to note that energy prices shot up most dramatically in December 2000, when FERC freed them from price controls, and they did not settle down until the Davis administration had negotiated enough long-term contracts to end dependence on the spot market. Finally, McClintock cites NewPower Holdings as an exemplar of electricity market competition in Texas. However, Newsweek maintains that NPH, an Enron spinoff, was one of the ""deals that sank Enron."" This underscores the precarious nature of the electricity market--which Enron customers in California know all too well.

IN BRIEF / ENERGY Enron Bankers Delay Deadline for Financing

Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

Enron Corp.'s bankers gained a 23-day delay of a deadline to get commitments for $1 billion in financing the energy trader said it needs to stay in business after filing the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
A hearing on the financing in Bankruptcy Court in New York was postponed from Jan. 7 to Jan. 30, said to Martin Bienenstock of Weil Gotshal & Manges, which represents Enron.
""We have a lot of asset sales going on and don't have an immediate need for additional funds,"" Bienenstock said. 
Bankers at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. have been working to persuade lenders, including Bank of America Corp., UBS and Deutsche Bank, to take part in a $1.5-billion loan. 
In a related proceeding, Enron will auction off a controlling stake in its energy-trading business at a hearing set for Jan. 10. 
Internet-based trading generated about 90% of Enron's $101-billion revenue last year. 
Enron shares, which began the year at $83.13, fell 5 cents to 60 cents on the NYSE.

USA: Enron stock has rising value for collectors.
By Philip Klein

12/28/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s stock is rising once again - but don't look for its rebound in Standard & Poor's 500 index listings. 
Now it's joined a much more select group that includes stocks and bonds from Czarist Russia, Victorian railroads and countries that no longer exist: Collectors have been snapping up Enron stock certificates as artifacts of the company's spectacular collapse, not on hopes for a recovery.
While Enron's shares were at 58 cents in Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the physical stock certificate was selling for much more, fetching as much as $99.95 on the Internet. 
""It's one of the biggest bankruptcies ever and is quite a collectible,"" Bob Kerstein, president of a Scripophily.com, a Web site which specializes in selling old stock and bond certificates said on Thursday. 
Kerstein said he sold four of the certificates to a hedge fund manager who made a fortune selling Enron stock short. Now the investor plans to give the certificates out as gifts and display a framed one on his wall, like a stuffed deer head hanging on the wall of a hunter's study. 
The Enron certificate is blue and white, with an etched drawing of a brawny man in a hard hat sitting in the foreground of an oil field and a printed signature of Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay in the bottom right corner. 
""We just put it up today and we already sold five of them,"" Kerstein said. ""A company like Enron everybody wants."" 
Kerstein, whose Web site sells certificates ranging from 19th Century Railroad bonds to recent dead dot-coms such as WebVan, said that he could have sold 100 Enron certificates over Christmas if he had them on hand. 
Collectors of old stocks and bonds, who call their hobby scripophily or 'love of ownership,' seek out certificates that have aesthetic value, contain rare signatures or have historical significance. 
""People are always seeking a piece of history that says something about the time"" Kerstein said. ""Enron says a lot."" 
Enron's stock, which traded at $90.75 at its height in August 2000, hit a low of 25 cents earlier this month as the company spiraled toward the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. While investors can still buy the stock at 58 cents, Kerstein justifies his price by citing brokers fees and charges for issuing physical certificates. 
Unlike trading on the exchange, the pricing for the certificates is inexact and can vary by condition and other factors. Enron certificates were being bid on eBay Inc.'s auction Web site for as low as $19. 
Enron's transfer agent EquiServe Inc. said that in September through November it received requests to issue an average of 580 Enron certificates per month, but has received 3,500 in December alone, because of the interest generated by the bankruptcy filing. 
Thomas Carroll, who is the director of sales and marketing for satellite launching company International Launch Services, a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp. and Russia's Khrunichev Space agency, has been collecting stock certificates for over a year. He just bought the Enron certificate for sentimental reasons. 
""I was on the site this morning, and when I saw it I knew I needed to have it,"" he said. Back when Enron was Houston Natural Gas, he worked for a different satellite company that helped transmit data on the rate of growth of rust in pipelines. 
But stock certificates are not the only piece of Enron nostalgia out there, as the company's collapse is spawning an industry of its own. 
On eBay Inc.'s auction website, people are selling Enron watches, Yo Yo's and mugs. Several parody Web sites have also been set up by ex-Enron workers who are fed up with the company after seeing their 401(k) plans dwindle to a fraction of their value as shares of the company's stock plummeted. 
The Web sites, laydoff.com, enronx.com and thecrookede.com sell T-shirts with slogans such as, ""I got laid off from Enron and all I got was this lousy T-shirt,"" ""The Execs that Stole Christmas"" and ""I got Lay'd by Enron,"" a reference to the company's CEO Ken Lay. 
When told about what Enron certificates were selling for, company spokeswoman Karen Denne couldn't suppress a laugh. 
""That's a better price than Enron was selling for on its best day,"" Denne said.

USA: Bush says 'deeply concerned' about Enron collapse.

12/28/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

CRAWFORD, Texas, Dec 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush said on Friday he was ""deeply concerned"" about financial losses suffered by employees of fallen energy trading giant Enron Corp. , which earlier this month made the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. 
""I'm deeply concerned about the citizens of Houston who worked for Enron who lost life savings. It's very troubling to read the stories about the ones ... who had their Enron stock locked up in their 401(k) plans,"" Bush said at a televised press conference on his ranch in Crawford, Texas.
The president also said he had not been in recent communication with company executives, who were among major supporters of his election campaign. 
""I have had no contact with Enron officials in the last six weeks,"" Bush said in response to a reporter's question. 
""The government will be looking into this. The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) will be looking into the matter. Congress appears to be looking into the matter. There will be a lot of government inquiry into Enron and what took place there,"" Bush said. 
Enron, based in Houston, is under investigation by the market-regulating SEC, the departments of Justice and Labor and at least four congressional committees. 
""It's very important for us to fully understand the whys of Enron. There will be plenty of investigations,"" Bush said. 
A Wall Street darling just a few months ago, Enron on Dec. 2 made the largest bankruptcy court filing in U.S. history after a rescue takeover by rival Dynegy Inc. fell apart amid investor concerns about Enron's murky finances. 
Once ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of top companies, Enron's stock was trading at 58 cents a share at midday on the New York Stock Exchange, off an August 2000 high of $90.56. 
Thousands of Enron employees have lost their jobs and much of their retirement savings. A 401(k) retirement plan that made many of them heavily dependent on company stock came under fire at a recent congressional hearing when employees said they were unable to sell their holdings when the stock price plunged.

Enron Seeks Bankruptcy Court Approval for Asset Sales by Year-End
By Christina Cheddar

Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
NEW YORK -- Enron Corp. has asked the judge overseeing its bankruptcy case to approve the sale of several hundred million dollars worth of assets by the end of the year.
The assets were earmarked for sale more than a year ago as part of Enron's efforts to focus on its core energy trading business, according to papers filed Friday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York's southern district. 
In one transaction, Enron (ENE) is trying to sell two wind power generating facilities in West Texas, Indian Mesa and Clear Sky, for $175 million to American Electric Power Inc. (AEP), of Columbus, Ohio. 
The generating facilities are owned by its Enron Wind Development Corp. unit, which wasn't part of Enron's bankruptcy filing in early December. 
According to documents filed with the court, AEP said the deal must be completed by Friday. Otherwise, the total value of the transaction will be reduced by at least $6 million to reflect tax benefits AEP will lose. 
Separately, Enron also wants the court to approve Enron Canada Power Corp.'s plan to sell its interest in electricity generated by the Sundance power generation plant in Alberta, Canada, for 215 million Canadian dollars (US$134.6 million) to a partnership operated by AltaGas Services Inc. and TransCanada Pipelines Ltd.'s (TRP) TransCanada Energy unit. 
Enron had originally expected the deal to close in the first quarter, but the company now wants to expedite the sale in order to stave off a default at the Canadian unit. 
Although the Canadian unit remains outside Enron's bankruptcy filing, its parent's Chapter 11 status has led some of Enron Canada's third-party creditors to ask the unit to post security to back some of its contractual obligations. 
In the filing, Enron Canada said it is concerned that if it can't meet these requirements and doesn't post security, it will be forced into an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding, which in turn would trigger a default under its Sundance agreement. 
If this were to occur, Enron said the Sundance assets would be ""worthless."" 
Enron said its ability to reorganize successfully is connected to its ability to sell the assets owned by its units that remain outside its bankruptcy case. 
As of last Wednesday, 23 of Enron's units have filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. About 3,500 other Enron entities remain operating worldwide, outside of bankruptcy court protection. 
Still, as a result of the bankruptcy filing, several purchasers of some of Enron's solvent assets have conditioned the closing of the divestitures on Enron's ability to get bankruptcy court approval for the deals. 
These transactions include Enron's sale of Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. to BG Group PLC (BRG) for $388 million, and the sale of Enron LNG Power Atlantic to an undisclosed buyer for $266 million, the company said in a filing with the court.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) has asked the judge overseeing its bankruptcy case to approve the sale of several hundred million dollars worth of assets by the end of the year.

Enron Wins Court Approval for $309 Mln of Asset Sales (Correct)
2001-12-28 14:57 (New York)

Enron Wins Court Approval for $309 Mln of Asset Sales (Correct)

     (Corrects amount of sale to $309 million in headline and
first paragraph.)

     New York, Dec. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the once-
dominant energy trader reorganizing in bankruptcy court, won a
judge's permission to complete two previously planned asset sales
that will raise a total of about $309 million.

     Enron plans to sell two wind-power facilities in Texas for
about $175 million to Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power
Co. Enron's Enron Wind Development Corp. unit, which isn't part of
the Houston-based parent's bankruptcy case, owns the power
generating facilities.

     In a separate sale, a partnership run by AltaGas Services
Inc. and TransCanada Pipelines Ltd.'s TransCanada Energy unit will
pay about $134 million for Enron Canada Power Corp.'s right to
electricity from a plant in Alberta, Canada. As with Enron Wind,
the Canadian unit isn't part of Enron's bankruptcy.

     U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez in Manhattan
approved Enron's request to proceed with the transactions at a
hearing late Thursday. The sales are scheduled to close today,
according to Enron's bankruptcy attorney, Brian Rosen, of New
York's Weil, Gotshal & Manges. Closing costs and fees will
slightly reduce the overall proceeds from the sales, he said.

     Enron sought Chapter 11 protection from creditors earlier
this month, in the largest bankruptcy filing ever. The company
sought refuge in bankruptcy court after Dynegy Inc. withdrew a $23
billion rescue in late November.

     Shares of Enron, which began the year at $83.13, fell 4 cents
to 56 cents in midafternoon trading. The shares have lost more
than 99 percent of their value in the past year. American Electric
shares rose 4 cents to $43.25.

                             Windmills

     American Electric agreed to buy 107 wind turbines in west
Texas that can generate power for San Antonio, AEP spokesman Tom
Ayres said. Although Enron Wind hasn't sought bankruptcy
protection ``both sides felt that the court should bless'' the
transaction, Ayres said. The windmills can generate enough power
to light about 160,500 average U.S. homes.

     Other purchasers of Enron's assets want the company to gain
court approval for its bankruptcy plan before completing the
transactions. As examples, Enron in court papers cited its
proposed sale of Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. to BG Group PLC for
$380 million and its proposed sale of Enron LNG Power Atlantic to
an unidentified buyer for $266 million.

     Enron LNG Power Atlantic owns Enron's stake in Eco Electrica,
a power plant and natural gas terminal in Puerto Rico. Mirant
Corp., an Atlanta-based power producer, agreed in July to buy Eco
Electrica from Enron and Edison International which also holds a
stake, for about $600 million.

                        ``Core Operations''

     Mirant Chief Executive Marce Fuller said last week that Dec.
31 is the deadline to complete the transaction. Enron's bankruptcy
made it unlikely the purchase will occur, she said.

     Enron Oil and Gas India owns 30 percent stakes in oil and gas
fields on the west coast of India. The sale has been held up by a
dispute between BG Group, and Enron's two Indian partners,
Reliance Industries Inc. and Oil & Natural Gas Corp. Ltd., over
who will manage the operations.

     B.G. Group said Monday it was continuing negotiations
although its agreement with Enron had expired.

     The asset sales are part of a plan Enron began more than a
year ago to return to its ``core operations'' and ``derive as much
value as possible from enterprises'' it bought or developed, the
company said in court papers. Enron said it's ``critical to the
success'' of its reorganization that its affiliates complete the
transactions started before the Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing.

Enron's Woes Cost New York Pension Funds $109 Mln, Paper Says
2001-12-28 12:05 (New York)

     New York, Dec. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is facing a
lawsuit from New York City over $109 million in pension-fund
losses because of investments in the company's stock, the New York
Daily News reported.

     The city filed suit against the energy trading company
because of ``accounting irregularities and fraud involved here
with the company,'' said David Neustadt, a spokesman for
Controller Alan Hevesi. Enron declined to comment, the paper said.

     The controller's office oversees pension funds worth
$85 billion for teachers, police, firemen, board of education
workers and others. Spokesmen for the police, fire, and teachers'
unions declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for District Council
37, the city's largest public employees union, didn't return
calls, the paper said.

     The news comes after reports that New York State's
$112 billion pension fund lost $58 million on Enron, the paper
said, citing state Controller Carl McCall's office.

Bush `Concerned,' Says Government Must Look Into Enron Collapse

Bush `Concerned,' Says Government Must Look Into Enron Collapse

     Crawford, Texas, Dec. 28 (Bloomberg) -- President George W.
Bush said the government needs to look into what happened at Enron
Corp. and he's concerned about employees who lost their savings
when the Houston-based energy trader collapsed.

     ``The government will be looking into this,'' Bush told
reporters during a visit to his Texas ranch. ``I'm deeply
concerned about the citizens of Houston who worked for Enron and
lost savings.  It's very troubling.''

     Enron this month filed the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy case
in history after its credit rating was cut to junk levels and it
couldn't raise cash to back trades. The company last month
restated five years of earnings to reflect losses and debt held by
affiliated partnerships.

     The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice
Department and Congress are investigating Enron's collapse. Former
chief executive Jeff Skilling and former chief financial officer
Andrew Fastow are named as defendants in more than 40 lawsuits
filed by investors and former employees who lost retirement
accounts after Enron's shares plunged. The stock, which began the
year at $83.13, traded this morning at 58 cents.

     The company and its employees, including chairman and chief
executive Ken Lay, have long been top financial supporters of Bush
and other Republicans. Enron and its employees have donated
$572,350 to Bush over the course of his political career.

     Bush said he's had no contact with Lay or other Enron
officials in the last six weeks.

     Enron and Lay have had close ties to the Bush administration.
Lay had a private meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney as the
White House shaped an energy policy that called for an increase in
domestic energy sources. Lay also participated in roundtables with
Bush and other business executives about the economy.

Cindy,
I believe the Bridgestone team rep is Mike Plunkett (mplunkett@dqe.com ).  
I'll copy this to Mike and maybe he can confirm.  
 
Chris, do you know Liz's (Cy Creek) email?
 
Also, I did contact Nicole, who is one of our coaches, and asked if she could use her KISD influence to help secure the Klein pool for divisionals.
 
Another advantage for using the Klein pool (vs Klein Oak) that we didn't talk about on Tues night is the 10 and under swimmers won't have to start from the bulkhead.  They can start from the blocks since ATEX has the covers for the warm up/down well.  At Oak this would be an issue.  Two years ago when these covers weren't around, parents, swimmers and coaches were upset that kids who were close to making invitational times would be hurt by having to start from the bulkhead. 
 
Thanks,
Jeff

"Re: Divisonals","Tom,

I like the air too.  Polling our board, they are spit on which pool but as
Jeff pointed out the kids can start from the starting blocks instead of the
bulkhead (which does affect their times).  That was an issue for several
teams when we were setting up a Klein Oak last year.  We should all talk
about whether to request the gym and the additional cost of doing so.  The
pool fees have increased since last year.  You can shoot an email to Jeff
and the other teams about the idea if you like.

Cindy,

Since the majority of the division wants Klein High School, I'll live
with it.  Becky Miller had a good idea, how about if we see if we can
also get their gym so we can have the teams set up in there.  It is not
as conveniently located to the pool as Klein Oak's gym is but at least
it keeps the teams out of the sun for the day.  What do you think?

Tom

P.S. you either respond to this address (work) or the other address you

The overall pattern looks unchanged from our views as of Friday.

From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

WILL wonders never cease? Last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on the table. 
Mark McGwire, the home-run-hitting baseball player for St. Louis, retired. And he let it be known that he never signed a two-year, $30 million contract his agent negotiated last spring. Why? Because he wanted to find out if his injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before. It didn't, and he decided he wasn't worth that kind of money.
Then Ken Lay, chairman of Enron Corp., said he won't take the $60.6 million he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when Enron is sold to Dynegy Corp. 
Of course, neither McGwire nor Lay will ever have to consider my fallback retirement plan - sacking groceries at the supermarket, carrying them to the car and hoping for a big tip. Still, it was a class act on both their parts. McGwire only hit .187 last season, well below his lifetime average. And Lay? Well, let's say that rarely in the history of American capitalism has a company sunk as fast as Enron. 
Remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of $82 a share. Now it's hovering in the single-digit level, and Enron is being forced to sell itself to a smaller rival. 
The stock price incentive 
How did Enron get into this position? Put the blame on the company's relentless drive to push up its stock price. And a big reason for that push comes from the way American companies compensate top executives. 
In the last couple of decades, executive compensation has soared. The average chief executive officer today makes 531 times as much in salary, bonuses and stock options as the average factory worker. 
Apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren't relevant. Most of the money top executives receive doesn't come from base pay or bonuses but from stock options. 
Such options usually work this way. Executives are given hundreds or thousands of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future date. The sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the stock on the date the options were granted. If the stock increases past the exercise price in the option, the executive can buy the stock and then sell it, making big bucks. It the stock has dropped below the option price - it's underwater, in the jargon - then those options are worthless. 
Granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareholders, those who favor this sort of incentive say. And that's true, if you talking about in-and-out traders. But it's not true if we're looking out for the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term. 
Keeping the debt hidden 
Keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down Enron. 
To hype the stock, Enron's execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel its amazing growth and some of its dicier investments, in partnerships. Enron was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals. That way it could move a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership. That, in turn, made the company's earnings look better. 
When Enron's executives finally fessed up, they had to write down their profits over the past few years by 20 percent. But the real irony here is that 80 percent is still a heck of a lot of money. But by that time, the majority of shareholders simply had no faith in Enron's bookkeeping. 
Now look at Lay's compensation. In 1999 he exercised stock options and made $44 million on them. In 2000, sales of options brought him $123 million, and this year about $26 million, according to a study published by Bloomberg News. 
Was Lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitable? I don't think so. He was simply following the latest fad in corporate governance. He was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders. 
The shareholders were happy with that high stock price. Nobody - besides some stock analysts - complained about Enron's often- impenetrable bookkeeping until that stock price started to fall. 
Would Enron's bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fewer stock options? Maybe. 
Fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys. And no one would want that job if he were only going to make $10 million a year instead of $100 million. 
Just kidding.

Economic News Helps Stocks, Not Bonds
By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

The New York Times
Page 17, Column 3
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Stocks rallied and bonds plunged last week as investors digested some positive reports about the economy. Inflation at the consumer level declined last month, retail sales surged after falling in September, and weekly initial unemployment claims slowed. 
All this news led some investors to conclude that the economy might not be as troubled as it appeared to be in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. That was good for the stock market, but very bad for the many bond investors who had been assuming the worst.
For the week, the Nasdaq composite index rose 70.10 points, or 3.8 percent, to 1,898.58, while the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 258.99 points, or 2.7 percent, to 9,866.99. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 18.33 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,138.65. 
But bond prices tumbled while yields, which move in the opposite direction, soared. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 4.85 percent, from 4.31 percent a week ago, the biggest weekly move in percentage terms since the note was first regularly issued 25 years ago. The jump in rates also showed that many investors no longer expect Federal Reserve policy makers to cut short-term interest rates when they meet next month. JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

Bullish, and Patient, on Energy Stocks
By JAN M. ROSEN

11/18/2001
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DESPITE last week's plunge in the price of crude oil and in shares of big oil companies, some Wall Street analysts remain upbeat about the long-term prospects for energy stocks. 
''These very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities,'' said Tina Vital, an oil and gas analyst at Standard & Poor's, who recommends a broad group of integrated oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP and TotalFinaElf. ''They have excellent management, a top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors,'' she said, provided that investors are patient and can bear short-term swings.
Last week's price declines were set off by Russian oil companies' refusal to accept demands by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for big production cuts. They were a reminder that the sector is extremely volatile. ''Oil could go to $10 a barrel short term,'' she said, but there is no certainty of that. The oil producers could reach an agreement by January, sending prices upward. Over the long term, she expects to see production cuts. 
Demand for energy has grown only 0.5 percent this year, and prices have been declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline -- as drivers have seen at the gas pump. West Texas intermediate crude closed Friday at $18.03 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 58 cents from its Thursday close, the lowest since June 1999. But an economic recovery, expected by late 2002, could cause demand to pick up, analysts say. 
As oil prices have dropped, so have the prices of most oil stocks, but not as much as the overall market since the beginning of 2000. Over that period, the S.& P. energy index has lost 8 percent, while the S.& P. 500-stock index is down 23 percent. 
A report issued last week by the Energy Department said that while the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks had intensified the country's economic slowdown, ''they are not expected to result in any long-term volatility in energy markets.'' The report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise 1.7 percent a year through 2020, instead of the 1.2 percent predicted only a year ago. Its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment, and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks. 
WHILE they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead, other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term. L. Bruce Lanni, senior oil analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons in New York, said that any potential price war was likely to be fairly short-lived, because neither OPEC nor non-OPEC countries could ''withstand low oil prices for a prolonged period of time,'' and prices should rebound sharply as a result, ''back up in the lower to mid-$20 range.'' 
Low prices could be painful for most of the oil companies in the short term, but Mr. Lanni, too, sees value in the stocks. 
His top pick is Conoco, now trading at $24.30; his 12-month target is $34. ''We remain confident,'' he said, ''that the company's annual oil and gas production should grow by about 4 percent, on average, over the next several years.'' 
Conoco's debt, at 55 percent of capital, is relatively high, but he expects the company's strong cash flow -- it equaled $5.33 a share last year -- to reduce the debt level to 46 percent next year and to 38 percent in 2003. The company's after-tax interest cost is only 3.5 percent, he said. 
Mr. Lanni also favors Kerr-McGee, a natural gas exploration and production company, and BP, calling both undervalued. He regards Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell and ChevronTexaco as fully priced, so he is not recommending buying them now. ''If you own them, hold them,'' he said. 
William Featherston, executive director and an oil and gas exploration analyst at UBS Warburg, said he felt ''near-term caution but medium-term optimism for sustainably higher'' natural gas prices. He said he would encourage investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies over the next two months. His top picks are Apache, Kerr-McGee and EOG Resources. 
Such stocks are highly volatile, he said. They are ''trading-oriented vehicles, and short-term volatility in commodity prices generally provides the most attractive entry and exit points,'' he said. ''While natural gas prices declined throughout most of this year, prices rose at a startling pace, from $1.75 per million cubic feet at the end of September to over $3 per million cubic feet within weeks.'' 
He cited three reasons for the price rally: a decline in gas surpluses, predictions of a colder-than-normal winter and what he has called ''pathetic third-quarter natural gas production,'' despite record drilling activity. 
The tangled finances of the Enron Corporation were also a factor in the recent price increase for natural gas futures, he said. Enron, which marketed 25 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, or more than 40 percent of the nation's demand, is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and announced a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity from deals with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer. It also reported a third-quarter loss and restated earlier earnings. Enron has agreed to be taken over by Dynegy, a smaller rival, for about $9 billion in stock. Dynegy is also assuming about $13 billion in debt. 
Anxiety over whether the Enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or have other market repercussions led to an increase in prices. While it is ''difficult to quantify the Enron factor,'' Mr. Featherston said, the short-term effects on natural gas prices seem to be over. 
OTHER factors, of course, could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors over the next several months. The status of the war against terrorism, President Bush's decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, thus helping OPEC in reducing excess global capacity, and a United Nations review of the food-for-oil deal with Iraq expected in December could each have a significant impact on battered oil prices. 
Nevertheless, Ms. Vital said, for the long term, energy will probably be in short supply, and new sources must be developed. So she also likes the prospects of two drilling companies, Noble Drilling and Nabors Industries. Both took a beating last week, along with the oil companies, so again she sees buying opportunities. 
Bern Fleming, portfolio manager of the AXP Utilities Income fund in Minneapolis, who has stakes in Dynegy, Duke Energy and Dominion Resources, said all three had good prospects for growth, thanks to a mix of assets, ''management I respect and solid business plans.''

Aquila Energy Makes Provision for Dynegy Withdrawal, FT Says
2001-11-18 19:52 (New York)

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Aquila Energy Corp. is one of
several energy traders limiting its trading with Enron Corp. in
case Dynegy Inc. pulls out of its bid for the company, the
Financial Times said, citing Aquila.

     Aquila said it began making contingency plans in case Dynegy
withdrew from its $24 billion takeover of Enron, the paper
reported.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, decided to sell after its
shares plunged this year and a federal investigation of accounting
irregularities limited its ability to finance operations. Enron's
collapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets, where the
company does one-quarter of all gas and power trades.

     Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron allows it to withdraw from
the transaction under certain circumstances, the FT said.



PERSPECTIVES
A tale of greed and hubris

For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of public utilities, the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly of relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy. 
A year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street, the poster boy for the utility industry, its stock selling for about $85 a share. Last week its stock was worth about 10 percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought by a competitor. There was fear the company's bond rating might fall to the ""junk"" level.
What happened? It will take months, if not years, to untangle the details, but it is clear that the main culprit was greed, closely followed by hubris. 
Not too many years ago Enron was a small, struggling, gas pipeline company in Houston. As deregulation spread to more and more states, Enron began acquiring pipelines, gas producers and utilities. 
It also acquired friends in high places, especially the Bush family and their key political advisers. And, it discovered it could make money faster by selling and trading energy than by producing it. Enron sold many of its generating plants and became the biggest ""power broker"" in the nation. 
Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked California consumers of tens of billions of dollars, Enron was one of the first power barons to take advantage of California's flawed deregulation law -- virtually written by in-state and out-of- state utility companies. 
The California fiasco soured (probably) most Americans on utility deregulation, but Enron was not singled out for calumny, and management saw no reason to examine its business ethics. 
Contrarywise. management had visions of even greater profits, which it felt no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders. The chief financial officer and other high-ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary partnerships which made deals with Enron. I do not understand the details of these arrangements, but neither do independent accountants, the Securities and Exchange Commission or congressional investigators. It does seem clear that the Enron insiders made millions for themselves. 
Enron acknowledges, without explaining, that stockholder equity dropped $1.2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overstated profits by some $600 million. Whether this was by design or by mistake is in dispute, but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the confidence of investors. 
So much for greed. Back to hubris. It seems not unlikely that Enron's leaders felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner-cutting because they had friends in high places. 
The chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was and is a personal friend of George W. Bush and has easy access to the White House. For many months after the new administration took office, Karl Rove, Bush's top political strategist, owned Enron stock valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and sold it only after he had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gains tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest. Lawrence Lindsey, the president's chief economic coordinator, and I. Lewis Libby, Vice President Cheney's chief of staff, owned stock in Enron, and Lindsey was paid $50,000 last year as a consultant for Enron. 
Enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bush's four political campaigns -- one (unsuccessful) for Congress, two for governor and one for president. In 2000, Enron and its employees gave $113,000 to Bush's campaign, $250,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $300,000 to the Presidential Inauguration Committee. 
Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy, key sub-Cabinet appointments, administration action or inaction in the California energy mess, and the overall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favorable to the interests of Enron. 
And now a couple of questions: Is it possible the unusual financial maneuvers by Enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy Texas oilmen in the Bush administration? Were those of them with heavy investments in Enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company? Was Enron right in thinking its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to reprimand? 
Or, in light of our preoccupation with terrorism, will the Enron case get much attention from the federal government? Or from voters?

MARKET BEAT
Counting Blessings Along With the Losses

Try finishing this sentence: ""The best thing about my experience as an investor in 2001 was ... "" 
Many Americans, contemplating the losses they've suffered this year in the stock market, might say there was nothing ""best"" about what happened to them--in fact, nothing good at all, perhaps other than that it might have been worse.
With share prices on the rise again, the damage to portfolios has been lessened. Even so, stocks will have to post strong gains in the next six weeks to keep this from being the market's worst calendar year since 1977. 
The blue-chip Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.6% last week, but it's still down 13.8% year to date. 
Yet those losses, while certainly not trivial (especially when they're yours), can obscure what arguably are some very positive aspects of this year's experiences. 
With investing, adversity can be a more important teacher than success. If you're having trouble this Thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful about anything investment-related, try these on for size: 
* ""Asset allocation"" is no longer just a quaint theory. The paramount investing rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk. But it took the worst stock bear market in 25 years to bring this lesson home for many people who thought equities only rose in value. 
Now, millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much they can lose in stocks--and how bonds and short-term cash savings can offset market losses and preserve capital. 
It has been a hard lesson, to be sure. But investors who take asset allocation to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in the long run. And don't underestimate what that can mean for your peace of mind long term. 
* The wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned. In the late 1990s, many economists lamented how the U.S. savings rate continued to shrink. Some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be rising nonstop. 
In other words, many Americans were letting the stock market do their saving for them when share prices were rising 20% or more each year. 
Now, with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns on stocks in this decade, it's clear that many people will have to find a way to save regularly if they're going to meet their long-term financial goals, especially retirement. 
This may not be a pleasant reality, but it's better for most people to have faced this fact sooner rather than later, while there may be time to make up lost ground. 
* A healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and those who tout them. The market's slide has discredited a legion of Wall Street analysts, money managers and others whose knowledge, understanding and judgment were clearly lacking, in retrospect. 
Investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present themselves as ""experts"" is a highly dangerous strategy, if it can be called a strategy at all. 
Sure, it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the moon and nobody had much use for reviewing a company's fundamentals. But that wasn't investing--it was speculating, and on a massive, and ultimately ruinous, scale. 
People have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the market, and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their portfolios in the long run. 
Just ask anyone who shifted their entire 401(k) retirement savings sum into aggressive-growth mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000--right before the market peaked--because of the bullish comments of some 25-year-old tech stock analyst. Those investors aren't likely to make a move like that again. 
* Free-market forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies. Capitalism may be harsh, but it's efficient when the good times end and it's time to find out which companies truly have talent and staying power--and deserve more capital. 
Hundreds of dot-coms have failed, but who really misses them? Is it any harder to find what you want on the Internet? It probably would have been much worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors' funds for another year instead of failing when they did. 
But the market isn't just eliminating small companies that never had much of a future. The financial near-collapse of energy giant Enron Corp. exposed a business that twisted accounting rules to its own benefit--to the point that the company now concedes that financial statements all the way back to 1997 ""should not be relied upon."" 
Also to be weeded out, though over a longer time period, will be mutual fund managers whose performance running other peoples' money has been a nightmare for those investors--meaning, the returns produced have been far worse than what the investors would have achieved in the average fund in that particular sector. 
These managers know who they are--and, hopefully, their shareholders know by now as well, and will vote with their feet. 
The free market also is reminding cartels just how tough it is to control prices. 
Once again, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has lost its ability to prop up crude oil prices, which have sunk to two-year lows amid the weak global economy. That's lousy for OPEC, but it's great for every energy consumer. 
* The market's woes have altered many investors' priorities for the better. The wild bull market of the late 1990s demanded peoples' attention, and got it. 
For some, stocks became an obsession. Their portfolios dominated their lives, especially if they were actively trading shares. They believed they were going to be rich, or richer, and that it was all because of how smart they were. 
Now, most people have been humbled by the market. In the process, some have realized that they don't want their mood determined by their portfolio's day-to-date price changes. 
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, of course, also changed many peoples' view of what truly matters to them. 
Money is important, but you aren't your stocks, and they aren't you. Life is more than a daily stock quote.

INVESTING James K. Glassman
Don't Be A Pudd'n'head, Diversify
James K. Glassman

The Washington Post
FINAL
H01
Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

Warren Buffett, who was probably the greatest investor of the 20th century, is fond of quoting the salacious actress Mae West as saying, ""Too much of a good thing can be wonderful."" In the market, such a motto would lead you to avoid diversification and instead concentrate your portfolio in stocks you really, really like. 
Peter Lynch, who was probably the best mutual fund manager of the 20th century, calls spreading yourself too thin ""diworseification.""
Smart, witty and brilliant at picking stocks, Buffett and Lynch may not need diversification, but the rest of us do. When you own one stock, you're out on a limb. For example, very few analysts -- with or without a conflict of interest -- predicted that shares of Enron, the energy and trading company, would tumble by 90 percent in a year. Put all your eggs in a basket like that and you end up with a gooey mess. The more stocks you own -- as long as they are in different industries -- the more the overall riskiness of your portfolio is modulated. 
The reason you don't want a super-risky portfolio is simple: While Warren Buffett may be calm and prescient enough to ride out severe dips in the value of his holdings, most investors are not. A portfolio that increases in price by 10 percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end of three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year, rises by three-quarters the second and rises by 52 percent the third. But reasonable investors prefer the consistent ride. It prevents them from doing something stupid, such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money during that first disastrous year. 
Consider the sad case of James D. McCall, who earlier this month resigned as manager of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty mutual fund. Two years ago, Merrill wanted McCall's services so desperately that the firm went to court to pry McCall away from his previous employer, Pilgrim Baxter, where he rang up impressive gains in the late 1990s. (His big success was called PBHG Large Cap 20.) And when they got McCall, Merrill's brokers raised more than $1.5 billion from their clients for him to invest. While the average growth-stock mutual fund owns about 100 stocks, with the top 10 holdings representing about one-fourth of the portfolio's total value, McCall specialized in what are called ""concentrated portfolios."" In the case of Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty, he owned, as the name implies, just 20 stocks. At last report, his top 10 holdings accounted for a whopping two-thirds of the fund's assets. 
If McCall had spread his 20 stocks among, say, a dozen different industries, he might have smoothed his ride. Instead, 69 percent of his assets went to technology firms. The Focus fund and a smaller one that McCall ran called Premier Growth were launched in March 2000. Within just 17 months, all but $650 million of the clients' original $1.5 billion had vanished. 
It is hard to imagine losing as much as Focus Twenty did even if you tried. As of Nov. 9, the week McCall resigned, the fund was down 72 percent for the year, compared with a loss of 14 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the benchmark for fund managers. According to the latest report from Morningstar Mutual Funds, 19 of McCall's 20 stocks had declined during 2001, the only exception being Harley-Davidson. More amazing, 16 of the 19 losers had fallen by at least half. (By the way, Enron was McCall's seventh-largest holding.) 
""This fund has had a wretched existence,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Kunal Kapoor, who did admit a grudging admiration for McCall's perseverance. McCall's ""faith may turn out to be well placed over time,"" Kapoor said. Unfortunately, time ran out. 
My point here is not to pick on McCall but to reveal the perils of concentration. Buying Focus Twenty as a technology fund, and consigning it to no more than one-fifth of your holdings (with the rest of your assets in diversified, conventional stocks or funds) might have made sense, but Focus Twenty was touted as a ""long-term capital appreciation"" fund, not a sector fund. Here, it failed, but maybe it didn't have to. 
The manager who made the concentrated fund popular, Tom Marsico, who ran Janus Twenty, took care to spread his holdings around. His successor, Scott Schoelzel, has suffered losses lately (he is down 28 percent year-to-date, but that's after a total gain of 546 percent in the preceding five years), but they have not been nearly so catastrophic -- and for good reason. Schoelzel's last report lists among his top 10 holdings three tech stocks, two financials, one drug company, one energy firm (whoops, Enron again), one industrial, one consumer-durables company and one services firm. 
For investors in individual stocks, the important question is this: How much diversification is enough? Some risk is inherent in even the broadest portfolio. This is called market, or ""systematic,"" risk. Over the past 75 years, market risk, as measured in standard deviation, has been about 20 percent. In other words, in two-thirds of the years the annual return of the S&P has fallen into a band ranging from 20 points lower to 20 points higher than its average return of 11 percent; that is, between a loss of 9 percent and a gain of 31 percent. That's still volatile, but if you invest in stocks you have to live with it. 
What you don't have to live with is anything more volatile. So your objective in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avoid what is called ""idiosyncratic,"" or extra, risk. A portfolio with just a few stocks, or one like McCall's, that is overloaded in a single sector, has lots of idiosyncratic risk. In 1977, an influential study found that investors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just 20 stocks in a wide variety of sectors; in fact, owning eight or 10 stocks depressed risk sharply. 
Recently, however, the market has appeared to be far more volatile, and a new study by a group of economists headed by John Campbell of Harvard found that many more stocks were needed -- around 50 -- to bring a portfolio down to the same level of riskiness as the broad market. What Campbell's group found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become more volatile in the 1990s, but that stocks within those sectors had, so you need to own more of them. 
But owning 50 stocks is a pain in the neck -- and it brings up the Buffett-Lynch admonitions about too much diversification. It is hard just to take the time to make the selections, but even buy-and-hold investors need to keep track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management, product failures or new competition (not to mention Enron-style accounting shenanigans) -- signs that it's time to sell. 
One good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual funds and stocks. For example, you might want to put 50 percent of the money you have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the S&P itself, like Vanguard Index 500, which charges rock-bottom expenses and guarantees that risk won't exceed systematic levels. You could also consider a broad fund that's managed by human beings, such as Meridian Value or Baron Growth, which are recommended by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor newsletter. Then another 25 percent of your holdings can go into a few sector funds that specialize in technology, real estate, energy and small-caps, and the final 25 percent into a portfolio of 10 to 20 individual stocks. (I own 16, at last count.) 
There are many valid variations. Just don't emulate Mark Twain. 
In a letter to clients recently, Anthony M. Maramarco of David L. Babson & Co., the Cambridge, Mass., investment firm, recalled the aphorism of Twain's Pudd'n'head Wilson: ""Put all your eggs in the one basket -- and watch that basket!"" Unfortunately, such a philosophy emphatically does not work in stock investing -- as Twain himself learned when he sank nearly all his fortune into the Paige Linotype, a machine that flopped. 
We all make mistakes. (It was Twain, after all, who pointed out that ""human beings are the only animals that blush -- or need to."") But smart diversification helps investors avoid some of the worst of them.

Wessex Water `to be sold'

(Copyright 2001 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)

Wessex Water, the water and sewage company, is understood to be up for sale following an offer to take over its owner, Enron, by Dynegy, the US energy group. 
Three years ago, Enron spent pounds 1.4bn on Wessex Water. But Dynegy is understood to want to concentrate on US and European energy assets and is not interested in non-core assets.
Any hope to regain the same amount of money could be derailed as the industry is put off by regulatory problems, and the company's results have worsened due to imposed price cuts over the past year. 
""It is not that there is going to be a fire sale but most of [the international assets] are not core to the businesses we will continue to pursue,"" said an Enron spokesperson. ""At the right price we will sell."" 
Scottish & Southern Energy and United Utilities have been touted as potential buyers, yet industry insiders believe that the UK regulator, Ofwat, will take a dim view of bids by UK water companies, as they are too large to buy it.

Quanta steels itself against takeover bid

(Copyright 2001)

Quanta Services, which builds and maintains power and communications lines, said Friday it is fighting a ""creeping takeover"" by UtiliCorp United, one of the nation's largest utility holding companies. 
On Thursday Quanta board members changed the Houston company's shareholder rights agreement - called a ""poison pill"" defense against takeovers - to deter UtiliCorp from acquiring a controlling stake.
The action was taken after negotiations with UtiliCorp fell apart and the Kansas City, Mo.-based company announced its intention to resume purchases of Quanta stock. 
A spokesman told Bloomberg News on Oct. 4 that UtiliCorp wanted to increase its stake to the mid-40s percentage range, which would give it effective control, with a vote on management. 
UtiliCorp invested $320 million in Quanta from September of 1999 through February of 2000, said UtiliCorp spokesman Ethan Hirsh, bringing its ownership up to 28 percent, and has been adding stock since then. It owned about 38 percent when a standstill agreement stopped further purchases in early October. 
Part of the shareholder rights amendment limits further purchases by Quanta by reducing the trigger point for the poison pill to 39 percent of Quanta's outstanding shares, instead of the 49.9 percent that has been in effect just for UtiliCorp. 
In addition to saying that UtiliCorp is no longer ""an exempt"" person under the 39 percent trigger, the amendments changed the kind of securities to be issued in the event the pill is triggered and how they could be exercised. 
UtiliCorp had a higher trigger point that other potential acquirers because it already was a significant shareholder when the plan was initially drafted. 
Hirsch didn't think the amendments would prevent his company from buying more. 
UtiliCorp's interest in Houston acquisitions is not limited to Quanta. Its also said this week it would like to buy Enron's share of a United Kingdom power station that provides electricity sufficient to light 1.88 million homes. 
It will soon get a 27 percent share in the station near London, known as the Teeside power station,through the purchase of a utility there. It would like the 42.5 percent that Enron owns, UtiliCorp President Robert Green said in a conference call. 
Green said he understood that stake was on Enron's for-sale list. 
UtiliCorp revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it bought 1.538 million shares of Quanta's common stock on the open market, at a cost of more than $24 million, between Sept. 28 and Oct. 3. 
Quanta's stock declined 27 cents to close Friday at $15.69, while UtiliCorp rose 10 cents to close at $27.50. Quanta's stock is down 51 percent for the year to date, and hit a 52-week low of $9.94 on Sept. 21. 
""After many weeks of negotiations with UtiliCorp, we could not reach agreement upon a strategy that would allow UtiliCorp to consolidate our financial results for accounting purposes on terms acceptable to Quanta,"" John Colson, Quanta's chief executive officer, said in a written statement. 
""In the face of UtiliCorp's communications last evening breaking off negotiations and stating its intent to resume open market purchases of Quanta stock, the board acted to protect the best interests of all Quanta stockholders against a change of control transaction which did not provide an appropriate benefit to all shareholders,"" he said. 
Quanta has a mutually beneficial relationship with UtiliCorp and hopes negotiations can resume, Colson said.

Offer still on table for Canadian Hunter 
Burlington Resources on Friday extended a $1.96 billion offer for Canadian Hunter Exploration Ltd. until Dec. 3 while Canadian regulators study the bid.
The cash offer was to expire Tuesday. Investment Canada, which oversees foreign ownership of Canadian companies, won't complete its review by then, Burlington said. 
Houston-based Burlington agreed to buy Calgary-based Canadian Hunter on Oct. 9. 
Azurix settles suit over Dynegy buyback 
Azurix Corp., a wastewater-services management company, won a judge's approval Friday in Wilmington, Del., to settle shareholders' lawsuits over parent Enron Corp.'s $329 million stock buyback in March. 
Houston-based Enron, soon to be bought by Dynegy, said in October 2000 it would pay $7 for each of Azurix's outstanding shares, or $275 million, to take the company private. Seven Azurix stock owners sued in Delaware Chancery Court seeking more money. 
Enron eventually agreed to pay $8.375 per share, adding about $54 million to the offer, and stockholders agreed to settle the lawsuit, lawyers said. 
SBC adds 2 states to long-distance rolls 
San Antonio-based SBC Communications received permission Friday from the Federal Communications Commission to begin offering long- distance service to customers in Missouri and Arkansas. 
The decision allows SBC to offer the service in the five states served by its SBC Southwestern Bell subsidiary. SBC has already received permission to compete in the long-distance market in Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma. 
While the FCC's decision was unanimous, there was discussion on whether SBC has made its DSL high-speed Internet access service available for resale and if the federal law requires such resale. The commission will address the issue in another proceeding. 
Airline canceling 200 layoffs of pilots 
FORT WORTH - American Airlines Friday canceled the planned Dec. 2 layoffs of 200 pilots because military duty was extended for pilots called up on reserve and other employees took leaves. 
American laid off 386 American pilots Sept. 28 and 200 more Nov. 1, as well as 120 at TWA Airlines. Those were among 20,000 jobs AMR eliminated as passenger demand fell. The company said it will bring employees back as demand improves. 
Southwest drops suit against Orbitz site 
DALLAS - Southwest Airlines Co. has agreed to drop a lawsuit that claimed Orbitz, an Internet travel site owned by five rival airlines, displayed incorrect information about Southwest's flights and fares. 
""It gives Southwest Airlines the right to restart the litigation at its current point if Southwest fares are ever displayed on Orbitz again,"" said Linda Rutherford, a spokeswoman for the Dallas-based airline.

AT ENRON, THE BIG DOGS ATE FIRST

11/17/2001
Portland Oregonian
SUNRISE

Summary: Workers' ire over 401(k) plans is understandable 
Watching Enron's bigwigs lose their jobs after inflating profits may offer some satisfaction to retirees and employees at the troubled energy marketer. But don't bank on it.
When corporate insiders can sell the company and stroll away with millions while workers and other stockholders are left with peanuts, it would be hard not to be bitter. 
As Oregonian business writer Jeff Manning reported Friday, local employees of Portland General Electric, an Enron subsidiary, watched their retirement savings sink after Enron announced on Oct. 16 that it would lose $618 million in the fourth quarter. This came after Enron officers made more than $136 million selling stocks earlier in the year. 
Then on Nov. 8, Enron dropped the other shoe: It admitted it had overstated earnings for four years by $586 million, or 20 percent. Over those few weeks, Enron shares plunged from $33.84 to its $9 close on Friday. 
The four-year overstatement developed through some novel accounting methods. Enron and its auditor, Arthur Anderson, insist that its financial reports were all within proper standards, but the mechanics in this case included obscuring debt by placing it on the ledgers of other entities so that the parent company's profit picture appeared rosier than it actually was. 
The weeks from mid-October to early November were wrenching for employees. Because the company was changing its fund manager, they were powerless to make any changes in their 401(k) plans. PGE chief executive Peggy Fowler points out that the change in 401(k) plan managers was announced last summer. And although employees could have gotten out of Enron stocks over the history of the plan, Enron seemed to be an attractive investment. 
Company executives, though, were selling. Jeffrey Skilling, who was promoted to Enron chief executive early in the year but resigned in August, sold more than $5 million in company shares according to transaction records covering the first half of the year. 
Former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was fired last month in an action related to the financial mess, made $14 million in stock sales betweeen March and November of last year. Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive, who returned after his protege Skilling left, made at least $20 million in stock sales from late last year. He has announced that he would decline his severance package. 
Dynegy, another Texas energy marketing company, has made a bid to buy Enron. That probably means the best Enron and PGE employees can hope for now is that Dynegy will be a better corporate owner, or they can try their luck with one of the many shareholder lawsuits being filed. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's activities. If its behavior was illegal, there will be consequences for company officers. 
That's still not much to offer to workers who have seen their retirement savings dissolve. But for now it's all there is.

FINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling.
By BARRY RILEY.

11/17/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

FINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling - The legacy of the late 1990s stock market bubble remains with us, as does irrationality THE LONG VIEW - BARRY RILEY. 
Optimism is back. Stock markets around the globe have typically rallied by 20 per cent since rock bottom was reached on September 21. Only 9 per cent of global fund managers believe equities will be lower in 12 months, according to a Merrill Lynch survey published this week.
But the legacy of the late 1990s stock market bubble remains with us. The challenge is how to minimise the level of irrationality. Two of the UK's biggest losers from crazy prices reported on Tuesday. Vodafone suffered #11.45bn of write-downs - but curiously, made no provisions against the sky-high #13.1bn it paid for third-generation mobile phone licences in 2000. 
Such payments, argued Sir Christopher Gent, Voda-fone's chief executive, were merely what the market demanded at the time. It is interesting to note, too, that Paul Klemperer, the Oxford professor who is an expert in ""auction theory"" and advised the British government, has defended the disastrous outcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital market's view of 3G's prospects. The common theme here is that it is nobody's fault if crazy prices are paid, because they are legitimised by the stock market. 
Marconi, which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone giant, has written off most of the #4.1bn paid for US internet hardware companies in 1999. There has also been a great deal of controversy in the US during the past few weeks over the near-collapse of Enron, the power group being rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival Dynegy. There was an obvious failure by investors - and by stock market analysts - to assess the true risks at Enron. 
Smart businessmen will sellat mad prices, but why on earth should they buy? The trouble is, too many academics have developed theories of value based on rational expectations. The real world is unfortunately very different. 
Some of the distortions had obvious technical origins. The Vodafone bubble of 1999 reflected the cross-border takeover of Mannesmann and the artificial weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as Vodafone ballooned in market capitalisation to reach, at one stage, 16 per cent of the FTSE 100 Index. The market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamentals, but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting, at which point they were ""safe"" in terms of risk against the index benchmark. 
That was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low free-float new issues: internet companies, especially, were floated off with only 15 per cent of the stock made available, although anything up to 100 per cent went into the indices, creating serious shortages and bubble valuations. Changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the problem, but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investment risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stocks. 
Takeovers have always been plagued by irrationality, and indeed this is an area where academics recognise the problem; over many years they have pointed out that all the benefits of deals, and often more than all, accrue to the shareholders of the companies taken over, while investors in the bidding companies suffer dilution. Investors know this, and in normal market conditions news of a takeover will depress the bidder's share price. But in a bubble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria, as well as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities of new equity. 
Also, it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market is high than when it is low. Two years ago, companies such as Marconi were engaged in buying sprees at daft prices. Now, when prices are much lower, hardly any acquisitions are being made (and investment banks are dismissing thousands of employees). An exception to the deal famine is gold mining, which just happens to have been one of the stock market's strongest sectors this year. 
Another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks. Over recent years their earnings-per-share forecasts for the next calendar year have been on average 8 per cent too high. This has not just been a mistake; they have been paid to be over-optimistic. Admittedly, attempts are being made to restructure the incentives here, as the embarrassed investment banks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors of judgment during the bull market, but it remains to be seen whether much will really change. 
The mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts, and indeed many professional investors do not. That Merrill survey, incidentally, shows that fund managers on average expect no more than 4 per cent earnings per share growth over the next year, while the stockbrokers' analysts are still clinging to the hope that it will be 15 per cent. 
A final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their executives the wrong sort of incentives. The ruin of Marconi may appear irrational, when multi-billion-pound acquisitions are being declared worthless after only two years. But executives with lucrative stock option plans, which pay off if their gambles go right, combined with golden goodbye and pension packages that are triggered if things go wrong, may well consider it perfectly rational, from their viewpoint, to take much bigger risks than other shareholders, or employees, would consider acceptable. 
Moreover, Sir Christopher Gent, shareholders of Vodafone will remember, received a controversial #10m personal bonus last year for clinching the Mannesmann takeover, a deal that requires #10bn of write-offs. 
In normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rational, but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window. Many investors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly. That is why many people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of winning is so small as to be not worth rational consideration.

WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Bears take upper hand on Wall St.
By MARY CHUNG.

After an early game of tug-of-war, the bears took the upper hand as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 5.40 lower at 9,866.99. The S&P 500 index gave up 3.59 at 1,138.65 and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.98 at 1,898.59. Volume was fairly heavy with 1.34bn trades in the NYSE. 
The indices were earlier bolstered by news that some of the leaders of the Taliban and the al-Qaeda terrorist network had been killed in bombing raids on Kabul and Kandahar this week.
However, the momentum faded as investors found little reason to keep sending stocks higher following a sharp decline in the US consumer price index. The index saw its steepest monthly drop since April 1986. Separately, the Federal Reserve reported another drop in industrial output last month. 
Investors appeared more hesitant to step into the market and buy stocks after several weeks of sharp gains. However, the corporate picture looked to be improving for some companies such as Dell. The computer maker reported third-quarter results that beat analysts' estimates by a penny and predicted a small rise in sales for the current quarter. Shares, however, fell 4 per cent at $26.60. 
Rivals Hewlett-Packard shed 2.7 per cent at $21.50 and Compaq gave up 3.7 per cent at $10.30. Yahoo!, the world's largest internet portal, jumped 4.3 per cent at $15.47 after it announced a restructuring and job cuts, but reaffirmed its guidance for the fourth quarter. 
Shares in Starbucks fell 9 per cent at $17.50 in spite of the coffee company reporting a 22 per cent rise in earnings for the fourth quarter. 
Energy prices rose in spite of the continuing dispute over oil production between Opec and Russia. Amerada Hess put on 2.5 per cent at $54.59 and Exxon Mobil added 1 per cent at $37.54. Enron, the embattled energy trading company, however, slid 5 per cent at $9. Most Dow components were lower as Alcoa slipped 1 per cent at $37.12, American Express shed 3.7 per cent to $33.13 and Wal-Mart fell 1.6 per cent at $55.10. 
Toronto was little changed in morning trade in spite of a rally in technology and cyclical shares, the first sectors expected to respond to an improving economy. 
However, at the close the S&P TSE-300 composite index was up 0.72 per cent at 7,315.30 as tech issues continued to strengthen. 
Overall, 11 of the market's 14 sub-indexes were higher but safe-haven gold stocks suffered as hopes grew for a swift conclusion to the war in Afghanistan. The tech-heavy industrials sector enjoyed a 1.61 per cent gain. Electronics manufacturer Celestica charged ahead, rising 3.3 per cent to C$64.80. 
Telecoms equipment heavyweight Nortel Networks jumped to C$12.69 as several investment firms raised targets.

IN BRIEF / ENERGY Pension Funds Consider Action Against Enron

Some big pension funds that invested in Enron Corp. said they are considering legal options in the wake of the energy giant's stock collapse and a regulatory probe of its dealings. 
Spokesmen for the New York state and city comptrollers and an official from Amalgamated Bank, a trustee of workers' retirement funds, said they were looking into lawsuits stemming from Enron's murky financial dealings and stock plunge.
Pension funds and mutual funds have been big holders of Enron, once a Wall Street darling whose stock has plunged 89% this year. 
Five New York City pension funds hold about 2.9 million Enron shares, said David Neustadt, a spokesman for the New York City Comptroller's Office. The funds serve teachers, police and other city workers. 
Enron shares fell 48 cents to $9 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron Investors Hope Filing Will Shed More Light on Finances
2001-11-17 11:06 (New York)

Enron Investors Hope Filing Will Shed More Light on Finances

     Houston, Nov. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. investors hope
the energy trader's third-quarter report to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission will answer some of the questions that
sent its shares tumbling and led to a proposed sale to rival
Dynegy Inc.

     Enron, which has been criticized for failing to clearly
explain how it makes money, may disclose in Monday's filing more
on how much is owed by the company and affiliated partnerships, as
well as any planned job cuts and other cost-saving moves related
to Dynegy's $24 billion buyout.

     ``Investors will be looking for anything that affects the
likelihood of the (Dynegy) deal going through and the timing of
such a deal,'' said Edward Paik, who helps manage the Liberty
Utilities Fund, which owns 1.6 million in Enron shares.

     Enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67 percent in
three weeks amid an SEC investigation into partnerships run by
Enron executives. Investors worry that new disclosures, such as
previously unreported debt, might threaten Enron's credit rating
and scuttle the merger, possibly pushing Enron into bankruptcy.

     ``There's been so much skepticism about what Enron's
liabilities are with these partnerships, I'm looking to quantify
this,'' said Glen Hilton, a fund manager at Montgomery Asset
Management LP, which holds Dynegy shares.

     Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay admitted last week that failed
investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to
Dynegy, and he and other executives pledged to be more open with
investors. Lay, 59, said last week he won't accept a severance
package of more than $60 million that he could have collected
following the takeover.

     Enron shares fell 48 cents yesterday to $9. Dynegy fell
$1.53, or 3.5 percent, to $42.47.

                           Balance Sheet

     Enron's third-quarter report, which had been expected last
week, was delayed by the Dynegy talks and a restatement of
earnings, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said. Enron
reduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million to
include losses from affiliated partnerships.

     Monday's filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheet
summarizing assets and debts. Enron for years has omitted balance
sheets, which the SEC requires as part of the 10-Q, from its press
releases announcing earnings.

     Investors renewed their criticisms of the practice after Lay
mentioned during a conference call last month that dealings with
two partnerships had reduced Enron's shareholder equity, or its
assets minus liabilities, by $1.2 billion. The disclosure led to
the ouster of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

     ``Everyone is trying to make their own assessment of what
(Enron's) ultimate liability will need to be,'' said Commerzbank
Securities analyst Andre Meade, who rates the shares ``hold'' and
doesn't own them.

     Monday's report probably won't give a complete answer, said
Louis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. While the
balance sheet will list liabilities for the partnerships, which
were set up to buy Enron assets and get debt off the company's
books, it won't spell out Enron's share, he said.

     ``What is the net liability off the balance sheet?''
Gagliardi said. ``We really don't know what that number is.''

                           Credit Rating

     Dynegy has said it can back out of the acquisition if Enron's
legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. The balance sheet ``will
help us see how good a deal this is for Dynegy,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, co-manager of the $1.4 billion Strong American
Utilities Fund, which owns 284,000 Dynegy shares.

     Both companies are based in Houston.

     The filing also might offer details on the SEC probe. ``It
may say what the SEC is looking for, and what the rating agencies
have told them,'' said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at
Williams Capital Group. He added, though, ``I don't expect much.''

     Enron's stock drop led Moody's Investors Service to cut the
company's debt rating to the lowest investment grade. Dynegy held
off on a purchase agreement out of concern that the rating would
be cut to junk, jeopardizing Enron's ability to raise cash needed
to settle its daily power and natural-gas trades.

     Enron may reveal where it expects to cut jobs and how much it
will pay to departing employees, Paik said. Chief Operating
Officer Greg Whalley said last week that fourth-quarter profit
will be hurt by severance payments and reorganization costs. He
didn't give details.

     Jobs likely will be eliminated in businesses the company
plans to sell, including its money-losing telecommunications unit
and operations in Europe, analysts said.

     Enron has about 21,000 employees, two-thirds in the U.S. and
about a fifth in the U.K. Its 600 traders are divided between
London and Houston, where Enron employs about 7,500.

     Many Enron workers are already preparing for layoffs, said
Lyndon Taylor, a Houston-based recruiter for Heidrick & Struggles
International Inc., an executive placement firm.

     ``I got 56 resumes last week from Enron,'' Taylor said.
``That's equal to the number I got in the past year.''

UK: Trade, bank buyers circle Enron's Wessex Water-reports.

11/17/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Both financial and trade buyers are considering bids for Wessex Water, the UK utility owned by crisis-hit U.S. energy group Enron , weekend press reports said. 
According to the UK trade magazine Utility Week, Enron's rescue buyer Dynegy wants to offload Wessex as soon as possible, and focus on integrating Enron's core energy businesses.
A report in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper named German bank WestLB as a possible buyer at a price of 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion). WestLB is the financial backer of the management buyout team that owns another southern England regional utility, Mid Kent Water. 
Utility Week raised the possibility that UK power utility Scottish & Southern might be interested.

Financial Post: Canada
A user's guide to living in Calgary: People moving from Houston find the cities much alike
Claudia Cattaneo
Financial Post

11/17/2001
National Post
National
FP7
(c) National Post 2001. All Rights Reserved.

U.S. oil companies are setting up shop all over downtown, usually picking high-quality office space with lots of open space. Anadarko Petroleum Corp. is located at Fifth Avenue Place, Burlington Resources Inc. is in Bow Valley Square and Devon Energy Corp. is in Canterra Tower. Some end up in the offices of the companies they acquire. Conoco Inc. has moved into Gulf Canada Square. 
The big takeover wave has led to a reshuffling of downtown space. Today, there is a shortage of large spaces and an increase in small ones available for sublease.
Some would like to get the towers they occupy named after them but landlords resist this because naming a building after one tenant can be a disincentive for others. 
Oilmen's favourite hangout is the Calgary Petroleum Club, founded by U.S. and Canadian oilmen in 1948 in the Palliser Hotel. Members have reciprocal membership at the Petroleum Club of Houston. But Calgary's Pete Club is a bargain compared to its Texas counterpart. The initiation fee in Calgary is $2,000, monthly dues are $65 and the minimum amount members must spend in a year is $600. The initiation fee for full membership at the Petroleum Club of Houston is US$3,500, monthly dues are US$110 and the minimum house account is US$75 per quarter. 
U.S. executives running Canadian oil and gas operations earn substantially more than their Canadian counterparts because their compensation is competitive with the U.S. market. 
When U.S. oil companies purchase Canadian operations, they like to keep as much of the Canadian staff as possible, since they are even more aware than their Canadian rivals of the ""war for talent."" 
When recruiting locally, U.S. firms pay competitively but of course will pay what they must to get the best candidate. They also offer competitive benefits and stock-option plans. U.S. employers gulp at the generous holidays enjoyed by Canadian oilpatch employees. 
There's no American neighbourhood in Calgary, although many recent arrivals are buying homes close to the city's core, particularly in such high-end neighbourhoods as Mount Royal, Elbow Park and Britannia, where homes sell for $500,000 to $2-million. 
Some U.S. companies purchase condominiums in such areas as Eau Claire on the Bow River to house U.S. executives in transit. 
Ted Zaharko, a broker-owner with Royal LePage, says Americans are driven by lifestyle choices and the fact that they can afford to buy expensive homes. Living near other Americans isn't important. 
The cost of living is lower in Calgary than in many comparable U.S. cities. However, U.S. cities become more competitive for high-income earners because personal income taxes in Canada are higher than in the U.S. at the higher income levels. Offsetting factors include access to health care, clean air, a short commute to work and the nearby mountain playground, which tend to be important to affluent people. 
U.S. oil types may have strange accents -- many come from the southern states -- but oilpatch jargon is pretty much the same. Calgarians and Americans understand one another when they talk of dry holes (no discovery), wildcat wells (exploration wells) or roughnecks (rig workers). The language of money is also the same: barrels and U.S. dollars. 
Oilpatch humour is also borderless. One of the latest jokes circulating by e-mail, courtesy of oilpatch investment dealer Peters & Co., is called ""Understanding Enron."" The U.S. energy giant is in trouble over its use of off-balance-sheet transactions to keep debt off its books: 
FEUDALISM You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk. 
FASCISM You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you the milk. 
PURE COMMUNISM You have two cows. Your neighbours help take care of them and you all share the milk. 
APPLIED COMMUNISM You have two cows. You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk. 
TOTALITARIANISM You have two cows. The government takes them both and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned. 
MEXICAN DEMOCRACY You have two cows. The government takes both and drafts you into the army. 
EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY You have two cows. The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply. If there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to milk the cows. They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the drain. They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows. 
AMERICAN DEMOCRACY The government promises to give you two cows if you vote for it. After the election, the President is impeached for speculating in cow futures. The press dubs the affair ""cowgate,"" but supports the President. The cows sue you for breach of contract. Your legal bills exceed your annual income. You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy. 
CAPITALISM You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income. 
ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.

WestLB Offers to Buy Enron's U.K. Water Unit, Newspaper Says
2001-11-17 20:01 (New York)


     London, Nov. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, Germany's largest state-owned bank, is one of
several suitors talking to Enron Corp. about its Wessex Water
unit, which is valued at more than 1 billion pounds ($1.4
billion), the Sunday Telegraph said without citing sources.

     Dynegy Inc. of the U.S. is looking to buy Enron for $24
billion, and will sell some of its assets, including Wessex.
WestLB made a formal offer to Enron in the past few days in hopes
of striking a quick deal because Dynegy may want to avoid the
regulatory risk in such a sale; any bid for a water company in the
U.K. worth at least 30 million pounds must be referred to the
Competition Commission, the newspaper said.

     Enron bought Wessex for 1.4 billion pounds in 1998. RWE AG of
Germany, Europe's fourth-biggest power company, is also interested
in Wessex, but Enron thinks U.K. regulators won't approve an RWE
bid because the company already owns Thames Water, a large U.K.
water company.

     WestLB has also been reported to be preparing a buyout for
Railtrack Group Plc, the insolvent owner of the U.K.'s train
tracks and stations, the paper said.


Enron Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon

Enron Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon

     Houston, Nov. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. closed Wednesday
on a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon
Smith Barney Inc. that was secured with assets of its Transwestern
Pipeline Co., spokesman Vance Meyer said.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, said Nov. 1 that it had
received a commitment for $1 billion in loans from the investment
banks that would be used for debt payments and to supplement cash
reserves.

     Enron secured the loans with the assets of Transwestern and
the Northern Natural Gas Co. The two pipeline systems combined are
about 19,000 miles long and can deliver as much as 6 billion cubic
feet of gas a day. The remaining $450 million loan, secured with
the Northern Natural Gas assets, is in the documentation stage and
is expected to close next week, Meyer said.

     Enron agreed a week ago to be acquired by Dynegy Inc. in a
transaction now valued at $24.7 billion in stock and assumed debt.
The move followed a loss in investor confidence -- the company's
shares had fallen 90 percent this year -- and amid a federal
investigation of accounting irregularities that limited its
ability to finance operations.

     ChevronTexaco Corp., the second-biggest U.S. oil company and
Dynegy's largest shareholder with 26 percent, provided Enron,
through Dynegy, with a $1.5 billion cash infusion on Tuesday as
part of the buyout agreement.

     In return, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights
in the Enron unit that owns Northern Natural Gas. If the merger
isn't completed, Dynegy will have the right to acquire Northern
Natural Gas, Enron said in regulatory filing Wednesday.
ChevronTexaco will provide Dynegy with another $1 billion after
the merger closes to maintain its equity stake.

     The shares of Enron fell 48 cents to $9, while shares of
Dynegy fell $1.53 to $42.47. Both companies are based in Houston.
Shares of San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco fell 35 cents to
$83.45.

Investigators To Take Hard Look At Enron's Board

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Investigation into the collapse of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) has already put its top executives and accountants in the hot seat.
Now they may be joined by the company's board, which includes former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Wendy Gramm, the wife of Republican U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas. 
Lawmakers will hear from two Enron board members next week. Congressional committees probing the matter expect testimony from William Powers, who headed an internal investigation, and Robert Jaedicke, an accounting professor and former Stanford University business school dean who is the chairman of Enron's audit committee. 
Audit committees were put in the spotlight by former Securities and Exchange Committee chairman Arthur Levitt. Levitt pushed through rules to require audit committees to include independent members with financial expertise and require the auditors to ask tough questions about a company's accounting. 
Whether Enron's audit committee failed as badly as the company did remains to be seen. The Houston energy firm filed for bankruptcy in December after announcing it had overstated financial results for nearly five years. Enron and its accountants are under investigation by Congress, federal prosecutors and the SEC. 
Examination of audit committee members is standard in such cases, and given her expertise in derivatives, Gramm, director of regulatory studies at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, could get special attention. She joined Enron's board after leaving the CFTC in 1993 and serves on its audit committee. 
As the wife of the Phil Gramm, Gramm won't get special treatment, however, said Charles Elson, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. 
""She will rise or fall based on her own conduct,"" he said. 
At a minimum, Elson said Enron's audit committee should have seen ""a lot of red flags raised,"" starting with ""highly unusual"" off-the-books partnerships tied to Enron's former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's outside auditor, also acted as its internal auditor and did significant consulting work for Enron. Moreover, Elson noted, a number of Andersen executives took high-ranking positions at Enron. He said that should have prodded the board to question Andersen's independence - which is required under the strict new SEC rules - and Enron's accounting treatment, including related-party deals kept off the company's books. 
""You have to ask yourself what these folks were thinking,"" said Elson. ""If they were aware of it and didn't press it, they've got some problems."" 
W. Neil Eggleston, the attorney representing Enron's independent directors, declined to comment on their behalf.

Enron May Have Compromised Its Internal Inquiry, Democrats Say
2002-02-01 15:38 (New York)

     Washington, Feb. 1 (Bloomberg) --  Enron Corp. may have compromised its own investigation of the events leading to the energy trader's bankruptcy by appointing one of its board members to the panel, Democratic lawmakers said.
     As a board member, Herbert Winokur Jr. approved many of the partnerships in which Enron hid about $600 million of its debt, contributing to the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, wrote Representatives John Dingell, senior Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Peter Deutsch, the lead Democrat on an investigative subcommittee. Their letter went to William Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school, who's heading the internal Enron investigating commmittee.
     Powers is expected to release his report this weekend and answer questions next week before two congressional committees, including House Energy and Commerce Committee. The letter shows the line of questioning the Democrats are likely to take.
     Dingell and Deutsch said that Winokur had knowledge of the LJM partnership and recommended that an Enron ethics policy be waived so that then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow could invest in the LJM1 and LJM2 partnerships. Fastow made $30 million from his investments in the partnerships.
     ""Mr. Winokur is essentially investigating his own actions and approving or disapproving the resulting report,'' the lawmakers wrote. ``You can understand why disinterested observers might conclude that the report's independence, or at least the appearance of independence, has been compromised.''
     The other members of Enron's internal investigating panel are Frank Savage, chief executive officer of Savage Holdings LLC, and Paulo Ferraz Pereira, executive vice president of Brazil's Group Bozano.
     In the letter, the lawmakers said that Winokur's position as chairman of the board of Azurix Corp., a water company created in part by Enron, cast doubt on his ability to be part of an impartial probe. Winokur sold 22,500 shares of the company to Enron for $184,275 before shareholders sued the company, saying it misled investors.

SEC Faulted Audit Oversight for Years, Letters Show
2002-02-01 11:40 (New York)

     Washington, Feb. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountants pressured the accounting profession's oversight group for more than four years to strengthen safeguards intended to make sure audits are accurate, complete and objective, SEC documents show.
     In letters to the Public Oversight Board spanning more than four years, SEC chief accountants faulted the industry's ability to enforce audit standards and guard against conflicts of interest through ""peer reviews,'' in which accounting firms check one another's systems for preventing bad audits. Then-SEC Chief Accountant Lynn Turner asked why peer reviews always gave the biggest firms good grades while the number of failed audits was growing.
     ""We have seen more of these in the past six months than at any time during my three years,'' Turner wrote in July 2001 to oversight board Chairman Charles Bowsher. ``Why is there nothing showing up in the reports from the peer reviews regarding this increasing problem?''
     Congress and the SEC are scrutinizing the accounting industry's ability to monitor audit quality and punish violations of auditing rules, as federal investigators probe auditor Arthur Andersen LLP's role in inaccurate financial statements at Enron. Documents sent by the SEC to the oversight board from 1997 to 2001 were released to Bloomberg News under the Freedom of Information Act.
     Enron stock tumbled 99 percent over seven weeks before the Houston energy trader filed for bankruptcy reorganization in December. The fall wiped out $26 billion in market value, wiped out 5,000 jobs and erased about $850 million in employees' 401(k) retirement investments in Enron shares.

'A Crisis First'

     ""For anything to happen in government, there has to be a crisis first,'' former SEC accounting fellow Thomas I. Selling said, when asked whether the peer review process for auditors has become more rigorous under the SEC's prodding. ``I don't know of any profession where peer review works.'' Selling is an associate professor at Thunderbird, the American Graduate School of International Management in Glendale, Arizona.
     Bowsher's Public Oversight Board, a five-member body created in 1977 to monitor auditors' systems for catching audit flaws, voted yesterday for the second time to disband. The oversight board had announced on Jan. 22 that it would close to protest its exclusion from deliberations that led to a plan by SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt for creating a new body to oversee audit quality.

A 'Very Difficult Time'

     Some audit controls, such as using computers to spot financial conflicts of interest with prospective clients, improved during four years of SEC prodding, Bowsher said. Other shortcomings continue because of resistance in the accounting industry, he said.
     ""We were pushing on some of these issues, but we were having a very difficult time having these things improved,'' Bowsher said in an interview.
     Peer reviews and accounting oversight are in the forefront of debate about audit regulations in the wake of Enron's collapse. The energy trader blamed bookkeeping errors, in financial statements certified by Andersen, for the need to restate earnings going back to 1997.
     Still, Andersen got unqualified good marks in its latest peer review, released Jan. 2. Andersen's reviewer, Deloitte & Touche LLP, looked at 240 audits after Andersen asked its rival for tougher-than-normal scrutiny while questions swirled about Enron. Enron's audit was not among those examined.

Pitt's Proposal

     Pitt's outline for change calls for the SEC to work with the biggest accounting firms to create a private oversight body, with funding from outside the accounting industry, to monitor and discipline auditors. Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, who appointed Turner, said last week that Pitt's proposal ``needs more teeth.''
     An April 1997 letter, the earliest released under the freedom of information request, questioned whether cost saving in the name of efficiency was hurting the quality of audits and producing fewer records than peer reviewers needed.
     ""Some changes being undertaken in pursuit of operating goals, such as reducing audit hours and focusing audit objectives on increasing the perceived value of the audit to client management, may have the effect of compromising audit quality,'' wrote Michael Sutton, who was then SEC's chief accountant. He declined to comment on the letters.

Peer Review

     In a Dec. 9, 1999, letter, Turner cited apparent lapses in peer reviews of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and one of its predecessors, Coopers & Lybrand LLP. A peer review of Coopers & Lybrand stated the firm had ""extensive, appropriate'' policies for preventing conflicts of interest, while several cases were found in which people at the firm weren't notified about new clients with which they may have a conflict, Turner said.
     Pricewaterhouse wasn't taken to task in a peer review of its standards, Turner said, though the accounting firm settled SEC charges that executives and the firm's pension fund compromised its independence by holding stock in more than 70 audit clients.
      ""We strongly recommend that the POB undertake a special review'' of possible independence violations, Turner wrote to Bowsher. A month later, in January 2000, Pricewaterhouse released a consultant's report saying 8,064 independence violations were discovered at the firm.
     ""We did a very extensive review and put new systems in place a couple of years ago'' to alert employees about stock holdings that present a conflict of interest, Pricewaterhouse spokesman David Nestor said. The Wall Street Journal Wednesday reported Turner's comments about Pricewaterhouse and Coopers.

'A Systematic Failure'

     The released letters show the SEC staff often was at odds with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants over the SEC's concern about conflicts of interest when auditing firms do consulting or other non-audit work for clients. The AICPA is the industry's professional group.
     Firms auditing public companies ""may lack sufficient worldwide quality controls to assure their independence from audit clients,'' Turner wrote in the Dec. 9, 1999, letter. ""The SEC staff has identified additional, troubling examples that suggest not only a lack of sufficient global safeguards, but also a systematic failure by professionals within certain firms to adhere to even their own firm's existing controls.''
     Last year, Turner expressed disappointment that AICPA ""failed to take any disciplinary actions'' in some cases where the SEC had found violations. In a Feb. 9, 2001, letter, Turner faulted the AICPA's disciplinary process for ``a lack of public accountability and reporting.''

'Mutual Back Scratching'

     The SEC chief accountant said there was a perception within the industry that ``partners in large accounting firms are treated more leniently in the disciplinary process'' than other accountants.
     A March 20, 2001, letter expressed concern that the peer review process is little more than ""mutual back scratching.''
     In another letter, dated April 9, 2001, Turner said, ""during the past three years, an alarming number of deficiencies and in some cases outright lack of quality controls within the accounting profession with respect to auditor's independence have been brought to the attention of the staff.''
     The SEC letters span the 2000 debate over an SEC proposal to bar accounting firms from many kinds of consulting for audit clients. During the debate, accountants marshaled congressional allies to their side to beat back some of the tougher provisions. Levitt and big accounting firms reached a compromise, easing the proposed restrictions while requiring public disclosure of auditors' fees.

SEC Audit Discipline Study

     Representative John LaFalce of New York, ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, has asked Pitt to provide SEC correspondence with the oversight board or the AICPA. LaFalce's request came after the Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC staff, under Turner, began a report on weaknesses in accounting self-regulation.
     Preparation of the report, which Turner said would have pointed in a different direction than Pitt's regulatory plan, stopped when Turner left the agency in August, SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan said.
     The study of accounting shortcomings was a ``personal project'' of Turner and ``didn't get finished'' before he left the SEC last August, Harlan said. Because the project was ``already dead before (Pitt) came in the door,'' Harlan said there ""was no reason to bring this to his attention.''
     Turner now is head of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University and a consultant for Bloomberg News. Levitt is a director of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News.

Enron Partnership Investors Sue to Force Out Former Executive
2002-02-01 14:30 (New York)

     Wilmington, Delaware, Feb. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Investors who put at least $300 million into an Enron Corp. partnership used to cordon off debt from its books are battling in court to bar a former Enron executive from running the venture.
     Eleven investors in LJM2 Co-Investment LP, including Citigroup Inc. and The Travelers Indemnity Co., have sued in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington to remove Michael Kopper as general partner. Kopper, former head of Enron's North American division, took over in July as the partnership's head from former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.
     The LJM2 partnership is a target of a dozen government investigations into the collapse of Enron, which filed the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December. Enron's disclosure in November that Fastow made $30 million managing two off-book partnerships, including LJM2, hastened Enron's collapse.
     Control of more than $300 million may be at stake in the suit to remove Kopper. The court papers don't say, and lawyers on both sides declined to comment. Investors could be left with nothing if the partnership's assets are pulled into Enron's bankruptcy case, lawyers said.
     ""Creditors are likely to make a move on anything left in this partnership in which Enron has an interest,'' said Chuck Tatelbaum, a Naples, Florida, attorney representing two Enron companies with claims against Enron in the bankruptcy case.
     Fastow set up dozens of private partnerships to buy and sell Enron assets. Kopper worked with Fastow at Enron to help market some of the partnerships to investors and left the company to run LJM2, according to company filings and court records.

Partnership Assets

     Fastow formed LJM2 in 1999, and the partnership acquired energy and telecommunications assets from Enron, including an 18,000-mile fiber-optic network it bought in June 2000 in a transaction that resulted in a $67 million profit for Enron.
     LJM2 sold the network six months later for a $53 million profit, according to documents Enron filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
     ""Mr. Fastow and Mr. Kopper are the architects of controversies that led to'' Enron's bankruptcy, Michael Goldman, a Wilmington lawyer representing the suing LJM2 limited partners, said at a Jan. 10 hearing in the case.
     ""Mr. Kopper has interests that are in conflict with both the partnership and the limited partners,'' Goldman told Chancery Court Judge Jack B. Jacobs in seeking to bar Kopper from controlling the partnership while the case is litigated.

Feb. 25 Trial

     Jacobs ordered Kopper on Jan. 15 to hand over the partnership's reins to turnaround specialist Jay Alix & Associates and make all ""books, papers and records'' available to the firm pending a trial due to begin Feb. 25.
     Kopper and his lawyers didn't return calls seeking comment on the suit.
     In court papers, Kopper said the investors who are trying to remove him violated the partnership agreement.
     He said investors like Citigroup Inc.'s Citicorp and The Travelers Indemnity Co., which agreed to invest $10 million and $3.1 million in LJM2 respectively, missed a Jan. 4 deadline for providing funds owed the partnership. That included their share of a $70 million interest payment, he said. The loan is now in default, he added.
     The partnership agreement prevents them from banding together to force out the general partner because they defaulted on those payments, Kopper said.
     ""We intend to continue serving as the general partner of the partnership with the goal, as always, of maximizing asset value for the partners,'' Kopper said in a Jan. 7 letter to the partners. A copy was included in the court file.

Partnership Agreement

     Lawyers for the partners suing Kopper said in court papers that they've complied with the partnership agreement's requirements for ousting the general partner. Limited partners with a combined investment of more than 66 percent of the partnership voted to remove Kopper, the lawyers said.
     ""Kopper has refused to acknowledge his removal and has taken numerous acts to jeopardize the partnership and the limited partners,'' Goldman said at the Jan. 10 hearing before Jacobs, according to a transcript.
     For example, Kopper is trying to direct defense lawyers representing LJM2 in a dozen suits in Texas state court over deals involving the partnership, Enron and other Enron-related units, Joseph McLaughlin, a New York-based lawyer representing limited partners, noted in court papers.
     ""Plaintiffs believe that immediate removal of Michael Kopper is needed to ensure that the partnership and its limited partners receive adequate and conflict-free representation'' in the suits, McLaughlin said in the filing.

Raiding Allegation

     Kopper also raided the partnership's accounts after learning of the bid to remove him, partners allege in court papers.
     The day before limited partners voted to force him out, Kopper transferred $4 million from the partnership to pay half his annual management fee though he was only owed about $70,000, the partners alleged. He also took improper steps to disqualify the partners, they said.
     ""The limited partners, including some of the largest financial institutions in this country, want to stop the bleeding and the threats of Mr. Kopper,'' Goldman told Jacobs.
     Among other investors who agreed to invest in LMJ2 are the American Home Assurance Co., $22.7 million; the Arkansas Teachers Retirement System, $30 million; AIG Private Equity Portfolio, $7.2 million; the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, $15 million; CIBC Capital Corp., $15 million; Merrill Lynch LP Holdings Inc., $16.6 million, and RHO Fund Investors II LLC, $15 million, according to court filings.
     Merrill Lynch is a passive, minority investor in Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News.

Happiness is a hot Enron hearing: Capitol competition

A vicious rash of ""Enron envy"" has spread across Washington, D.C., with no fewer than 11 separate congressional committees competing for the chance to interrogate witnesses to the biggest corporate scandal in American history. 
Publicity-seeking politicians and their minions are battling for the spotlight; everyone wants a whack at Ken Lay. The former Enron Corp. chief is scheduled to appear before the Senate commerce committee on Monday.
""This is the best committee,"" crowed Nu Wexler, press secretary to Ernest Hollings, chairman of the commerce committee. ""I'd say that, of all the hearings, this is the big one. We've got Lay. It's his first committee [appearance], and the only one, as far as I know. It will definitely get lots of attention. Every committee wants press."" 
Enron is the hottest story in town. Once the largest energy trader in North America, the company declared bankruptcy on Dec. 2, after a series of accounting irregularities came to light. Investigators are also looking into Enron's practice of shifting millions of dollars in debt into partnerships held by its executives, allowing the company to overstate its financial health. 
Some congressional workers in Washington have claimed victory for merely scheduling Enron committee inquiries ahead of their colleagues. 
A brief exchange published in the latest edition of The New Republic magazine reveals how nasty the competition has become. A spokesman for Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Senator, bragged that a committee chaired by his boss was ""the first to announce we were having [an Enron-related] hearing, back on Nov. 29."" 
This was bitterly contested by the press secretary to Bryon Dorgan, a Senator from North Dakota and chairman of the congressional subcommittee on consumer affairs. ""Dorgan held the first hearing"" on Dec. 18, his spokesman told the magazine. 
That is also incorrect. In fact, the first hearing related to the Enron bankruptcy took place on Dec. 12, under the auspices of the House financial services committee. 
Not only did it get a head start on the others, that committee boasted the most important witness to date: Joseph Berardino, chief executive of Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that approved Enron's fallacious financial reports. 
Though he tried to deflect blame away from Andersen for the Enron disaster, Mr. Berardino admitted to ""a crisis of confidence in my profession ... The accounting profession will have to reform itself."" 
Then Congress broke for Christmas; since the holiday, Enron has become an even bigger story, with a suicide and allegations of favouritism levelled at the Bush administration. Everyone seems to have forgotten Mr. Berardino's provocative remarks. 
One congressional committee generating heavy interest has not even released a witness list or scheduled its Enron hearing. Yet the permanent subcommittee on investigations is on every Washington reporter's ""must attend"" list. Why? It has the power to subpoena Enron documents. It is also notorious for tackling juicy topics. This, after all, was the forum used by the late Senator Joseph McCarthy to conduct his anti-communist crusade. 
Then there are the also-rans, such as the Senate banking, housing and urban affairs committee. A complete stranger to controversy, this committee plods into the Enron fray in mid-February. ""We will not be rushed,"" the committee's press secretary, Jesse Jacobs, said. ""If there's any Enron envy out there, we don't feel it. We're in last place. Our senators are not after the limelight."" 
No kidding. Mr. Jacobs says no Enron witnesses are scheduled to appear before the committee. Instead, members will take a ""sober and historical"" look at regulatory and investor protection issues. Bor-ing.

Enron chairman gave list of favored names to White House; Bush named two as energy regulators
By MARCY GORDON
AP Business Writer

02/01/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A few months after the White House got a list of recommended candidates from former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, a friend and backer of President Bush, two of them were appointed to a federal energy commission. 
Lay gave the list of names to Clay Johnson, Bush's personnel director, White House spokeswoman Anne Womack said Thursday. Among the eight or so names were Pat Wood, now chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and Nora Brownell, a member of the commission.
""It was one of many, many recommendations that he (Johnson) received"" from industry executives, members of Congress and state officials, Womack said in an interview. 
Disclosure of Lay's recommendations to the White House last spring comes as congressional panels investigate the relationship between Houston-based Enron Corp., which filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, and the Bush administration. 
The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Enron's complex accounting and what role its auditor, Arthur Andersen, played in the Houston-based company's collapse. Andersen has acknowledged destroying Enron-related documents. 
A senator leading an investigation said Thursday that Enron had not cooperated in providing important information on the complex web of partnerships used by the company to conceal massive debts. The company's attorney said it doesn't have the documents sought. 
As head of a major campaign donor, Enron, wielding significant influence in Washington, Lay enjoyed access to top government officials of both parties. The White House has acknowledged that Lay met once privately last year with Vice President Dick Cheney, who headed a task force that formulated the administration's national energy policy. 
Lay disclosed the existence of the list of Enron favorites in an interview being broadcast Friday on PBS' ""NOW with Bill Moyers."" 
""I brought a list, we certainly presented a list. ... As I recall, I signed a letter which in fact had some recommendations as to people that we thought would be good (FERC) commissioners,"" Lay said in the interview, which was taped in May but never aired. 
Bush, as Texas governor, had appointed Wood in 1995 as head of the state's Public Utilities Commission. Wood has been an advocate of market-oriented regulation of utilities, a position espoused by Enron, a big, aggressive energy trader that had become a favorite of Wall Street. 
Bush appointed Wood as FERC chairman in August, replacing Curt Hebert. 
Hebert said in the PBS interview that Lay ""has asked me to take certain positions but I've had those conversations with Ken Lay for a long time. And have disagreed with him for a long time."" 
Brownell, a member of Pennsylvania's Public Utility Commission, was nominated by Bush in March. During her time on the state commission, Brownell helped oversee Pennsylvania's electricity deregulation. 
Lay will be the star witness next week as a blizzard of hearings by several congressional panels put the Enron collapse under intense public scrutiny. 
Enron officials ""just simply have not cooperated"" in providing the documents sought, said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., chairman of a Senate Commerce subcommittee. ""We again renew our request."" 
An estimated 3,000 partnerships, some with names of ""Star Wars"" characters such as Jedi, were created by Enron, which took a 97 percent stake in each of them and brought in outside investors for the remainder. The partnerships were kept off Enron's books and helped create the accounting debacle that pushed the company into the biggest U.S. corporate bankruptcy filing ever. 
Dorgan said the committee had no immediate plan to subpoena the documents from the company. 
Robert Bennett, a Washington attorney representing Enron, said, ""We have been fully cooperating with them."" 
Bennett said the committee has asked Enron for documents that the company doesn't have and must be obtained from the partnerships or people representing them. 
""We are exercising enormous good faith in cooperating with that committee,"" the attorney said in a telephone interview. 
In a related dispute between Congress and the Bush administration, investigators at the General Accounting Office told the White House on Wednesday they would sue to make officials identify the industry executives, including some from Enron, who met last year with Cheney's energy task force.

Enron Executives Using Company Jets to Attend Bankruptcy Hearings

02/01/2002
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Associated Press 
HOUSTON -- Since Enron Corp. filed the largest bankruptcy in history last year, the company has used its two jets for eight round-trip flights to New York where the case was filed, a spokesman said Thursday.
Seven of those flights carried a total of 43 passengers to bankruptcy hearings before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez in New York, spokesman Mark Palmer said Thursday. 
The eighth flight this week transported family members of former Enron executive J. Clifford Baxter to his funeral on Wednesday in his hometown of Amityville, N.Y. 
Mr. Baxter, 43 years old, was found dead in his car in an affluent Houston suburb early Jan. 25. Police determined that he shot himself in the head with a .38-caliber revolver found beside him. 
""We have had in the past two months a total of eight round-trip flights,"" and the one for Mr. Baxter's family was for personal reasons, Mr. Palmer said. 
Some friends of the Baxter family joined that flight, including one Enron employee who was close to the family, Mr. Palmer said. 
Mr. Baxter resigned as Enron's vice chairman in May last year after working for the company for a decade. He was named in an August letter written by another executive, Sherron Watkins, as complaining to former chief executive Jeff Skilling about accounting practices that helped fuel the fallen energy giant's collapse last year. 
Mr. Palmer said before Enron (ENRNQ) filed bankruptcy Dec. 2, the company owned two jets and leased three. After the filing, the leases were canceled. 
Of the remaining two jets, ""both are for sale and have been for sale. They haven't sold because the market for airplanes is terrible,"" Mr. Palmer said. 
Deborah DeFforge, laid off from Enron Dec. 3 after working for the company for five years, said the continued use of jets is hard to swallow when former workers are living on unemployment benefits and trying to find jobs in a tight economy. 
""I think just using the plane is obscene, but for that family it's not obscene,"" she said. ""My heart goes out to that family.""

Agent: Lays close to selling Aspen lot

02/01/2002

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

ASPEN, Colo. (AP) - An undeveloped lot owned by former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay that has been listed for $2.95 million could be sold in the next few weeks, said a real estate agent. 
But the asking prices of two homes owned by Lay and his wife, Linda, have been reduced, said Joshua Saslove, the broker handling the transactions.
The sale of a fourth Aspen property, a cottage, is being negotiated privately, said Saslove, who wouldn't discuss any of the asking prices. 
Linda Lay said in an interview Monday on NBC's ""Today"" that she and her husband are struggling to avoid personal bankruptcy and are selling nearly everything they own. 
Lay, former chairman and chief executive officer of Enron, will appear before Congress next week to answer questions about the collapse of the energy giant, which is embroiled in the nation's largest ever bankruptcy. 
The Pitkin County assessor's office listed the taxable value of the Lays' three-bedroom Aspen cottage at about $4 million. 
The couple's other two homes in the glitzy resort were initially listed at $6.5 million each, but Saslove said the prices have been reduced. One is now advertised for $6.125 million, and the other for $6.15 million. 
Saslove said the price reductions reflect market conditions. ""They (the Lays) just want to be marketing their properties realistically,"" he said. 
Lawyers suing Lay and other Enron executives claim he sold 1.8 million shares of Enron stock for $101 million from October 1998 to November 2001, though it's not clear how many of those sales were required under stock option rules. 
Thousands of employees with the Houston-based energy conglomerate lost their jobs, and a class-action lawsuit was recently filed by workers claiming Enron is liable for billions of dollars in losses from employee 401k accounts. 
Enron's downfall also has come under scrutiny in the political arena, because the company has had ties to President Bush and was one of his biggest corporate supporters.

First-of-the-month bills leave ex-Enron employees in crunch
By LISA FALKENBERG

HOUSTON (AP) - Credit card in hand, a laid-off Enron Corp. employee went to the supermarket last month to buy all the Lean Cuisine meals he could stuff in his freezer. 
David Hunker allows himself to eat two a day, and that's it. The 27-year-old former associate analyst said Friday he hasn't bought food since.
""It's getting tougher,"" said Hunker, one of 4,500 Houston employees laid off in November after the energy giant's financial implosion. ""I'm going to try to figure out a way to pay this month's rent, but after that, I don't know that I'll be able to pay anything else."" 
For many laid-off Enron employees, the first-of-the-month bill collectors' harvest was even harder to face this week than it was last month. The bills are due, the money is running out. 
""Most of the people I know still have not found other jobs,"" Hunker said. ""The one payment that we got from Enron pretty much runs out right about now."" 
Rebekah Rushing, a former Enron employee who set up the Enron Ex-Employee Relief Fund, said requests for money grow even more desperate around the first of the month. 
""I've been getting more calls,"" Rushing said. ""I'm hearing people who are crying on the phone for the money."" 
Rushing said her fund has taken in about $160,000. She has handed out $100,000 so far to 80 people who have asked for her assistance in paying their mortgages, utility and food bills. Rushing, who found a job at another Houston energy firm, said she plans to give out at least 50 more checks next Thursday. 
She's received 400 requests for assistance. 
""It's really heartbreaking for me,"" she said. ""I'm trying to help as many people as possible."" 
Meanwhile, Hunker is perpetually pushing the resume, working the cell phone, exhausting his Rolodex of people who might know about an open job. But since November, there has been nothing, so he sits in his $1000-a-month, one-bedroom apartment in downtown Houston, trying to dig his way out of a financial hole that just gets deeper. 
His apartment complex has offered to restructure leases, but it won't reduce rent. He's considered moving out, but the lease termination fee is almost as much as rent and he hasn't gotten an unemployment check because he moved from a different state just two months before he lost his job. 
There are options, but they're not desirable for the 27-year-old who thought Enron was the key to a successful career. 
""We've talked about all trying to move in together,"" Hunker said of his former colleagues. ""Trying to fit another person in my one bedroom apartment may be kind of tough, but it may be what we have to do."" 
Sylvia Brooks, president of the Houston Area Urban League, which is helping ex-Enron employees find jobs, deal with bill collectors, and in some cases just vent about their situation, says some, but not any, mortgage companies have agreed to extend payment deadlines for ex-Enron employees. 
""It's done every day. We work out deals,"" she said. ""The companies are flexible. They're responding to layoffs. We've experienced this before so many of the companies know how to respond."" 
But even understanding companies won't wait longer than two months, Brooks said. 
""The bottom line is that they're businesses and they're looking for their payment,"" she said. 
Houston utility Reliant Energy, Inc. doesn't have a special plan to help displaced Enron employees pay their utility bills, said spokesman Richard Wheatly. 
""We do have normal policies and procedures that can be looked at on a case-by-case basis, as we do with all customers,"" Wheatly said.

Enron's Cooper Keeps The Faith On Firm's Reorganization
2002-02-01 16:00 (New York)

   By Christina Cheddar and Kathy Chu 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In his first public appearance as Enron Corp.'s new chief executive, Stephen Cooper spoke in the firm tones that lived up to his reputation as a no-nonsense kind of guy. 
  ""I do not see this as a liquidation,"" he said, adding that his view historically has been that creditors receive more cents on dollar when a company reorganizes than when it liquidates. 
  ""Regardless of how effectively you run that liquidation  ... there is a patina of distress,"" Cooper said. ""People will attempt to put you over a barrel."" 
  By Cooper's account, Enron will emerge as a smaller company, one without the powerful energy trading operation that became its identity. But a survivor, nonetheless. 
  His task now is to move in and organize. 
  But while Cooper is keeping the faith that Enron will be able to reorganize, creditors appear to be losing their confidence. They wish him well, but believe that he'll have to overcome significant odds to get Enron back on its feet. 
  ""I've got the highest regard for Steve Cooper, you can't really be a bankruptcy professional and not know him or know of his reputation,"" said Scott Baena, an attorney at Bilzin Sumberg Dunn Baena Price & Axelrod LLP in Miami. 
  Baena, whose firm represents a group of former Enron employees, said he believes Cooper is intent on reorganizing  - even though it's too soon to know if this is possible. 
  ""For Steve Cooper, reorganization is an aspirational goal, but we don't always get what we want,"" Baena said. 
  Cooper has more than 30 years' experience in leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.  He will be joined in his efforts by professionals from the restructuring consultancy, Zolfo Cooper LLC, that he helped create. 
  That experience carries clout, and that could make a difference in the case. 
  ""I think his appointment makes it less likely that a trustee will be appointed,"" said Richard Tilton, a New York  bankruptcy lawyer. 
  Judge Arthur Gonzalez, who is presiding over Enron's bankruptcy, is likely to deem the appointment of an independent trustee - to take over Enron's daily operations - as excessively disruptive to already complex court proceedings, according to Tilton. It's more likely, he said, that the judge will name an examiner to probe certain aspects of fraud or misdeed in the case. 
  To be sure, Enron's bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history, will likely remain prominent in the public eye as long as Congress continues its numerous investigations. Turnarounds are always sensitive matters, but it is rare for  the reorganizational efforts to be this public. 
  Cooper's experience may help him make the quick decisions that will be needed to tackle the job. 
  But creditors will be looking for results fast, according to Charlie Rhoads, a partner at the Houston office of Boyden Global Executive Search. 
  ""There is no honeymoon period because an interim CEO really falls under the role of a consultant,"" he said, explaining that there is less patience for results from an individual with this type of experience. 
  On Wednesday, Cooper gave a rough outline of his plan, and in it the new Enron looked very much like old pipeline company that gave birth to the original Enron. The company would retain its gas pipelines, and would assess whether to preserve or sell the rest. The businesses that might be sold include money-losing power plants in India and Brazil, Enron's broadband assets, and the water and wastewater business that were once part of Azurix Corp. 
  One way to do this would be to combine the assets and the liabilities of all Enron subsidiaries. This move, called a substantive consolidation, would put some creditors at a disadvantage and result in them getting paid less for their claims. 
  With this in mind, some creditors have petitioned the court to segregate the cash flowing into one of Enron's units because they claim the parent company can't be trusted  to keep accurate records and divvy up the funds among the business units. The creditors want detailed accounts of the cash flows into Enron units. 
  Given Enron's legal structure, Cooper believes it is ""highly probable"" that not all creditors will be treated equally. In other words, in the end, there just might not be  enough to pay off all creditors after the web of off-balance-sheet partnerships are untangled.

POWER POINTS: Enron On The Potomac - Anything Goes!
By Mark Golden

02/01/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)-It's still too early for cherry blossoms in Washington, D.C., but at congressional hearings on Enron the silly season is in full bloom.
In particular, any attempt to tie Enron and the California energy crisis of a year ago into a unifying theory on the evils of deregulation grabs big headlines. So what if there isn't an important connection? Never let the facts stand in the way of a good story, especially with so much money on the line and an election to win. 
At Senate Energy Committee hearings Tuesday, an energy consultant from the Northwest, Robert McCullough, made a reasonable pitch for more transparency in energy markets and for enforced disclosure of all corporations' off-balance sheet subsidiaries. 
But McCullough, a registered Republican in favor of electricity deregulation, supplied the Democratic Party with a plum. Almost as a side note, McCullough said that forward prices for wholesale electricity in the Northwest fell 30% when Enron filed Chapter 11 on Dec. 2. ""The clear implication is that Enron may have been using its market dominance to 'set' forward prices,"" he surmised. 
The rest of McCullough's testimony was shunted aside. Outraged Senators Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Ron Wyden, D-Calif., and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., demanded congressional hearings and a federal investigation into this new revelation: Nasty Enron had been manipulating the power market right up until the day it declared bankruptcy. It must have been the culprit behind the western electricity crisis a year ago! 
""Where there's smoke, there's fire,"" Cantwell said. 
Investigations were launched, and Wednesday's newspapers across the country ran with headlines like ""Enron Witness Raises Specter of Price Fixing."" 

Someone Tell The Traders 

Western energy traders, meanwhile, grunted a collective, ""Huh?"" The people in the market every day don't remember a price collapse like that at the time of Enron's bankruptcy filing. 
""What is he talking about?"" asked one. 
If senators or their staff had bothered to look at the prices McCullough submitted with his testimony, they might have questioned his math. McCullough's data, taken from trade publisher Platt's, show power prices in Washington state for 2002 through 2004 falling from $37 a megawatt-hour before Enron's bankruptcy filing to $31/MWh 10 days later. 
That's a 16% drop, not a 30% drop. Platt's immediately disowned the 30% figure, as well as the consultant's explanation for the modest decline. 
In an interview Thursday, McCullough said his 30% figure came from confidential bids he obtained for clients, not from the Platt's prices he submitted. His bids fell from $40/MWh the week before Enron's filing to $30/MWh the week after. 
""The fundamental question is what happened that weekend (that Enron declared bankruptcy),"" he said. ""Will we know what happened more if it's 15% or 30%? I don't think so."" 
The size of the move might not mean that much to McCullough, but this is an election year, and California Gov. Gray Davis is facing an uphill race for reelection because of his handling of the energy crisis. Though prices and blackout fears have long since receded, the state is stuck with some $50 billion in overpriced long-term contracts negotiated by his appointees. 
Democratic senators saw an opportunity to lay the blame for Davis' mismanagement on yet another scapegoat. First it was the merchant generators' fault, but then it turned out they charged much lower prices than California's municipal utilities. Then it was El Paso Corp. (EP), accused of withholding supply to drive up prices of natural gas. Now, it's Enron. The Democrats must deflect all blame from Davis in 2002's most important single race. 

What Really Happened 

So, why did northwest electricity prices fall even 16% at the time of Enron's bankruptcy? The price history submitted by McCullough backs up what traders have been saying for months: Enron had been seen shorting western power since last spring, making money as prices collapsed. 
That view was confirmed this week by the Bonneville Power Administration, the federal power marketer in the Northwest. A year ago, Enron was selling to Bonneville at an average price of $50/MWh. Later, Enron bought the power back at about $18, according to Bonneville. 
In October, as Enron's credit quality and survival were being severely questioned, the company ordered its traders to ""flatten their books."" For Enron's western traders, that meant getting out of their short positions by buying back power to reduce the risks in their portfolio. 
Prices rebounded for a few weeks on Enron's buying, but that stopped in early November after Enron became unable to do many more deals. The bear market for all U.S. energy markets - which has continued to this day - resumed for western power. 
Aside from the politics, we're talking big bucks. Several western utilities hold hundreds of millions of dollars in long-term contracts with Enron that are now way above the market. Those contracts didn't go away with Enron's bankruptcy filing. Just the opposite - they became major assets of the estate. If they hold up, the utilities will have to pay the entire difference between their contracts and the current market up front, in cash. 
If the utilities can prove Enron manipulated the market, they might be able to get federal energy regulators to invalidate the contracts. Even high-priced contracts signed with suppliers other than Enron - like Davis' - might be nullified based on Enron's market manipulation. 
As for Feinstein's rush to judge Enron as the culprit behind California's energy crisis, McCullough called that ""a leap of faith."" 
That crisis was in the spot market for power needed on a daily and hourly basis. As big as Enron was, it was never big enough to control the spot market for western electricity, which was enormous until California started buying everything under long-term contracts last summer. 
For all its questionable activities, Enron isn't to blame for California. The state botched deregulation under the leadership of the previous governor, Republican Pete Wilson. The Davis ignored the crisis for eight months, until after the state's two largest utilities were flat broke, and then largely botched the solution. 
End of story? Not a chance. McCullough is scheduled to testify Wednesday before a House committee on market power abuse.

Enron's fall darkens summit Leaders at global forum fear effects of giant's collapse

NEW YORK -- Forget the bomb squads roaming Park Avenue, the potential riots from anti-globalization protesters and the police armed with submachine guns guarding what some are calling ""Davos on the Hudson."" What's bothering the 3,000 businesses and political leaders brainstorming in the plush confines of the Waldorf-Astoria is the fallout from Enron Corp., the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. business history. 
Gathered in Manhattan for the World Economic Forum, this is a $25,000-(U.S.)-a-head salon for business and political titans to chew over the world's challenges. Many of the delegates are expressing fear, however, that revelations of late-night paper shredding in Houston and suspicious accounting practices are a serous blow to the stock markets they are relying on to end a near-global economic downturn.
""The Enron debacle creates a crisis within the entire capital market,"" said Samuel DiPiazza Jr., who yesterday was named the global CEO of PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""Our profession is right in the middle of that."" 
With many market watchers predicting that more companies will falter under billions of dollars in debt not properly cited on their books, Mr. DiPiazza said business leaders have realized that transparency in accounting is one of the major challenges facing Corporate America. 
""I absolutely believe it's on the minds of the CEOs walking these halls,"" he said. 
To deal with the public perception that accounting firms may have too incestuous a relationship with the clients they are supposed to be auditing, Mr. DiPiazza said PricewaterhouseCoopers believes it is crucial to separate its auditing arm from its lucrative consultancy work. 
""We believe the perception of conflict is something we must deal with,"" he said. ""It will not make us better accountants. But if it helps change the public perception, we think it's positive."" 
In a sense, the Enron scandal has gone global, the business leaders say. The world economy is relying on the U.S. economy to put an end to a recession felt around the globe, and if Enron is only the tip of the iceberg of similar bookkeeping tactics, it could slow down a Wall Street recovery. 
Gail Fosler, chief economist of the U.S. Conference Board, said the Enron implosion, following the collapse of stocks of companies such as Xerox Corp. and Lucent Technologies Inc., definitely has the world's investors wondering where the bad news will stop. 
""I wouldn't call it the Enron contagion, but it does undergird the sense of risk aversion that was already in play,"" she said, adding that the scandal has also hurt other companies seeking to take on debt to survive hard times. 
""I would even say Kmart was a victim of Enron,"" she said, adding that there was a broad tightening of credit when the energy giant entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. ""This is in some way an impediment to global liquidity."" 
For the first time in 31 years, the World Economic Forum is being held outside of Davos, a sleepy village in the Swiss Alps. It's an attempt by organizers to help New York recover from the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and throw leaders a Big Apple party: Tonight they will get to hear Paul Simon, Bono and Peter Gabriel in the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria. 
But the cozy nature of the conference has been altered by the move to Manhattan. Security is at an all-time high, with thousands of police and secret service agents in the hallways of the hotel, which is off-limits to all but registered delegates. That makes the chances of buttonholing those in attendance, from the likes of Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates to an artist like Bono -- something that was possible in Davos -- next to impossible. 
A survey of 1,161 CEOs from around the world, however, many of whom are in the boardrooms of the Waldorf-Astoria, has found that the obliteration of the World Trade Center has deflated the buoyant mood that usually marked the Davos summits. 
""Nearly 60 per cent [of CEOs] focus on two probabilities,"" said the PricewaterhouseCoopers survey. 
""Continuing stagnation in the global economy and the vulnerability of global supply chains."" 
The survey found that since the Sept. 11 attacks, about half of the world's corporate leaders have laid off workers, outsourced non-core businesses and imposed travel restrictions (although not necessarily their $300-and-up rooms at the Waldorf-Astoria). The survey found that the CEOs regarded these cutbacks as long term, although they believed that budgets for research and development would be restored. 
Perhaps most interesting, though, is that globalization protesters, who promise major demonstrations tomorrow, appear to be getting the attention of a large number of business leaders. 
One-third of the CEOs surveyed said they believe the ""anti-globalization movement"" is a threat to their business. Another third agreed that globalization is likely to increase the gap between rich and poor countries, precisely what the protesters will be chanting in the days ahead when they begin protests on the other side of the concrete barriers around the Waldorf-Astoria.

Accounting profession seeks to restore trust following Enron scandal
By SETH SUTEL
AP Business Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK (AP) - Stung by a collapse in public confidence following the Enron scandal, the accounting profession is taking steps to eliminate the appearance of conflicts of interest in the kinds of services they offer their audit clients. 
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, a professional group, said Friday for the first time that it would support any future proposal to impose certain limits on services accounting firms may provide to the companies they audit.
The statement came a day after KPMG, one of the five major accounting firms, reversed its opposition to limits proposed two years ago, which would have prevented auditing firms from providing information technology consulting or internal audit services to the companies whose financial statements they audit. 
The two actions came on the heels of an announcement from the leading accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, that it would spin off its consulting business into a separate entity. 
The plans, which had been in the works for many months, were accelerated because of concerns that the public perception of the accounting profession was hurting because of the Enron scandal. 
Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, acknowledged destroying documents and e-mails that were sought by federal and congressional investigators looking into questionable accounting practices which led to the swift collapse last fall of the energy trading giant. 
The non-audit consulting fees are often much more lucrative to the accounting firms than fees for auditing companies' books. For example, in 2001, The Walt Disney Co. paid PricewaterhouseCoopers $8.6 million for its auditing and $32 million for other services, according to its proxy statement. 
Critics contend the high fees could taint an auditor's objectivity when reviewing its client's books. 
On Thursday, Disney said it will not use its outside auditing firm for new consulting projects and will review those currently under way. 
Linda Dunbar, a spokeswoman for the AICPA, said that even though the group would support future limits on the bans that such restrictions were not the solution to the profession's problems and ""would not prevent the next Enron."" 
""Given where we are on public concerns on conflict of interest, it seems that some restrictions are necessary so that we can move on to more substantive issues,"" Dunbar said. 
Likewise, Stephen G. Butler, chairman of KPMG, called the controversy of service limits a ""red herring"" in a statement released Thursday, but he said the firm would now support the limits in order to move on to substantive reform of financial accounting practices. 
Spokesmen for PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young, two of the other five major accounting firms, both said their firms supported the limits on information and internal auditing consulting when they were first proposed two years ago under Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that their position hadn't changed. 
""When this was being debated two years ago we supported it then, and we support it now,"" Larry Parnell, a spokesman for Ernst & Young, said. 
""This is not a new position for us,"" Peter Horowitz, a spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers, said. ""We supported those positions two years ago."" 
A spokesman for Andersen didn't return a phone call seeking comment. The New York Times quoted an Andersen official as saying that his firm would make an announcement soon that would ""substantially change the way Andersen does business."" 
Deloitte & Touche released a statement Thursday calling the issue over the scope of services that accounting firms can offer ""principally one of perception. But it is a huge perception problem."" 
Nonetheless, the firm said ""it is premature to accept or reject any proposal, whether we agree with it or not, because the effectiveness of a complete set of reforms is what ultimately needs to be assessed."" 
Auditing firms can still provide certain non-auditing services to the firms they audit, subject to certain rules. 
But most accounting firms have already separated from their consulting divisions, including Andersen, whose consulting arm split off into a unit called Accenture. KPMG has spun off its consulting business, and In early 2000, Ernst & Young sold its consulting business to Cap Gemini SA, a French computer and management services company. 
Once PricewaterhouseCoopers' stock offering is complete, Deloitte will remain the only major accounting firm that is still united with its consulting arm.

Top Of The News 
Enron: A House Divided 

Dan Ackman, Forbes.com, 02.01.02, 9:26 AM ET 

""Divide and conquer"" is often a winning strategy. Enron's wrinkle has long been ""divide and disavow,"" and it seems that, for the bankrupt energy trader and its lawyers, old gambits die hard. 

One of the principal components of the Enron scandal was the company's practice of creating partnerships and then using them to push its assets or debts off its books. Technically this can be legal, so long as the partnerships are truly separate, which, among other things, means that outside investors control as little as 3% of the partnership equity. 

The myth of separation--while still strongly believed by Enron itself--is losing support among the accounting firms who have been tainted by Enron and other recent scandals. The Big Five accounting firms are coming around to the idea that providing certain consulting services to the same company it is auditing creates an inherent conflict and is bad business. 
Until recently, the accounting profession bitterly opposed any limits on its consulting services, beating back rule changes proposed by Arthur Levitt when he was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the Enron taint has spread past Enron's own auditor, Arthur Andersen, and the firms are seeking to police themselves lest others--such as the SEC--do it for them. 

PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG said yesterday said they would support such proposals. Andersen itself is said to be leaning in that direction and that it will soon announce substantial changes in how it does business. 

The Walt Disney Co. approved of the new regime of separation yesterday when its chairman, Michael Eisner, said the company would not use its independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, for any new consulting work and would evaluate the current projects the accounting firm's consultants are currently doing for the company. 

Disney in 2000 paid PricewaterhouseCoopers $8.7 million in audit fees and around $32 million in non-audit fees. PricewaterhouseCoopers, for its part, said it intended to spin off its consulting arm in an IPO, which could mollify Disney and others. 

Arthur Andersen, in 2000, separated from its old consulting arm, now known as Accenture, after a long-running dispute between the two sides of the firm. But since then, Andersen itself has beefed up its own consulting practice. According to a report in The New York Times, just over half the $52 million it billed Enron in 2000 was for consulting. 

Enron, of course, has fired its auditor--as if Andersen forced Enron's hand rather than the other way around--and it appears to be clinging to its old religion at least in the early innings of the Enron investigation. Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.), accused the company yesterday of failing to provide records for thousands of Enron-backed partnerships that were long known to--and approved by-- company directors. Dorgan is chairman of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer affairs, one of nine congressional panels probing Enron. 

A lawyer for Enron, Robert Bennett, responded to reporters, ""The senator is terribly misinformed. We have been totally cooperating with the committee."" Bennett added, ""The senator may be operating under the misimpression that we have possession of many of these special partnership entity documents, which we don't."" The documents would have to be obtained from the partnerships themselves. Instead of one subpoena, Bennett wants Dorgan to issue 3,000. In the unique dialect native to planet Enron, this stance is called cooperation. 

Dorgan, obviously acting without the benefit of a translator, was confused.""Virtually all of these partnerships would be 97% Enron and 3% someone else,"" he said. ""You'd certainly expect...you would have all of the records at your fingertips as a corporation."" But not having the records, the right hand not knowing what the left hand was doing, was increasingly how Enron did business. 

The Enron board, as Dorgan pointed out, had to approve the creation of the partnerships. The chairman of that board, Kenneth Lay, is scheduled to testify before a congressional committee on Feb. 4. Bennett told reporters Lay will appear before the committee: ""He's not going to plead the Fifth...Mr. Lay feels he has nothing to hide and that he's done nothing wrong and he wants to tell his story."" 

But Bennett represents Enron, not Lay personally. Lay's lawyer in Washington, D.C., is Earl Silbert. Silbert did not return phone calls seeking comment. But don't be surprised if, on Feb. 4, there is another division in the Enron ranks. 

From Enron to Cheney to California
Golden State politicians are on the warpath after a leaked memo reveals Kenneth Lay's instructions on how the White House should handle last year's electricity crisis.
- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Anthony York, Salon.com
Feb. 1, 2002 | The release of a memo from then-Enron CEO Kenneth Lay to Vice President Dick Cheney that included recommendations for how to handle the California energy crisis is encouraging the state's top politicians to call for more hearings and investigations into Enron's role. On Thursday, Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., called on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate charges of possible market manipulation by Enron and other power generators in the state. 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has asked Energy and Natural Resources chairman Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., to schedule hearings on Enron's role in creating California's broken energy marketplace. 
""I am writing to request an additional hearing to pursue what role Enron had in the California energy crisis with respect to market manipulation and price gouging,"" Feinstein wrote in her letter to Bingaman. ""Enron's ability to deal in complex unregulated financial derivatives in the natural gas market while controlling a tremendous share of the gas trading market, provided Enron the ability to manipulate market prices."" 
Critics say Enron was a big part of why the California energy marketplace was fundamentally flawed in the first place. Enron argued for a separate clearinghouse for all energy trades in the state, which had little regulatory scrutiny and operated in virtual secrecy. That, consumer advocates say, helped energy producers and traders like Enron to artificially manipulate the market and gouge the utilities, who were buying the wholesale energy to deliver to their retail customers. 
Bill Wicker, spokesman for the Energy Committee, says the chairman has not yet set a date for those hearings, but the interest of Feinstein, as well as Democrats Maria Cantwell, of Washington, and Ron Wyden, of Oregon, in holding such hearings is a good sign they will be held soon. 
The Lay memo, a copy of which was leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle, refocused attention on Enron's role in the California energy crisis. Lay gave Cheney the two-page document in April, as the two met to discuss California's situation and the formation of a new national energy policy. The memo outlines Enron's priorities for a national energy plan, and includes suggestions for how to solve the state's energy problems. Critics say it illustrates just how closely the administration's final plan mirrors Enron's priorities. Sen. Barbara Boxer called the memo ""a smoking gun."" 
Eight remedies for the energy problems in California are listed in the memo, which Lay gave to Cheney on April 17, including a recommendation to give private companies the power of eminent domain to seize private property to build new power plants or transmission lines. The memo also argues strenuously against implementing price caps on wholesale energy prices -- a key issue in the California energy crisis. Instead, Enron argued, the solution to the crisis should be more deregulation, not less. That closely mirrored Cheney's public comments the day after his meeting with Lay as politicians from both parties were calling for temporary caps. 
""Events in California and in other parts of the country demonstrated that the benefits of competition have yet to be realized and have not yet reached consumers,"" the memo states. ""The administration should reject any attempt to re-regulate wholesale power markets by adopting price caps."" 
On April 18, Cheney told the Los Angeles Times, ""California is looked on by many folks as a classic example of the kinds of problems that arise when you do use price caps."" 
While the memo does not shed a tremendous amount of new light on Lay and Enron's input -- Lay met with Cheney six times as the administration was crafting its energy plan -- it underscored once again how Enron had the administration's ear at a time when California was threatened with soaring energy prices and rolling blackouts. 
Lay, it appears, had better access than California's highest elected officials. 
""Throughout the crisis, I was not allowed a private interview with the president or vice president -- even though such a talk may have helped California,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein wrote in a recent editorial in the Los Angeles Times. ""Something is wrong when a senator representing 35 million Californians is not able to talk personally to the president or vice president in the midst of a crisis, but executives from a company that contributed millions of campaign dollars have complete access and significant influence."" 
Boxer is expected to confront Lay with the memo when Lay testifies before the Senate Commerce Committee on Monday. 
Feinstein and Boxer have directed most of their outrage at the administration for refusing to hear the pleas of Democrats and Republicans from California who begged for price caps on the state's out-of-control wholesale energy prices. The administration refused, adopting the same position as Enron -- that ""price caps, even if imposed on a temporary basis, will be detrimental to power markets and will discourage private investment,"" in the words of the Enron memo. 
Eventually, new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman Pat Wood acquiesced and imposed limited price caps on wholesale energy prices in the Golden State. Those caps -- along with other factors, including increased energy conservation and a cooler than expected summer out West -- led to an easing of the state's energy crisis as wholesale energy prices fell. 
The rising political heat, combined with Vice President Cheney's continued refusal to cooperate with the General Accounting Office's request for his notes from those energy policy meetings, is encouraging consumer advocates to up the ante. Doug Heller, from the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, speculates that Cheney may be refusing to cooperate with the GAO because he's trying to cover up for his buddies at Enron, who Heller says artificially manipulated California's energy market. 
""It seems clear now that Enron needed the ability to gouge California to keep their company going,"" he says. ""The big question now is, did Lay ever say to Cheney, 'We're in trouble, and we need to keep this thing going in California to pay off our debts'?"" 
Cheney has repeatedly said that he and Lay never discussed Enron's financial troubles. But Heller says the vice president's intransigence calls that into question. ""I think it's legitimate to ask just what Dick Cheney is hiding,"" he says.  

Democrats hope to use Enron 'to shape the entire political environment'

WASHINGTON (AP) - Seated in a circle, Democratic House leaders listening intently, former employees of Enron poured out the details of their layoffs, their depleted retirement savings, their bleak financial futures. 
""We need help right now,"" said Gwendolyn Gray, once a human resources assistant at the failed energy giant.
Congress may eventually provide some help. But the gathering this week in the Capitol, held before a clutch of television cameras, also underscored an effort by Democrats to gain election-year strength from the Enron debacle. 
""Enron has the potential to shape the entire political environment for 2002, impact other issues and reduce confidence in the Bush administration and Republicans,"" three prominent Democratic advisers wrote in a memo widely circulated in Congress this week. 
""The more people hear, the more corrosive it becomes,"" wrote James Carville, Stanley Greenberg and Bob Shrum. 
There's some risk to the strategy, since Democrats were counted among the top recipients of Enron-related campaign donations. 
And for their part, Republicans are taking steps to minimize any damage. 
President Bush has made a series of comments critical of Enron, whose former chairman, Kenneth Lay, was a longtime campaign supporter. 
""Corporate America must be made accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct,"" the president said in Tuesday night's State of the Union address. 
But even before the strategy memo surfaced, senior Democrats had begun making frequent mention of the bankrupt energy company, in ways designed to raise doubts about the Bush administration and GOP. 
""I think we are slowly Enronizing the economy, Enronizing the budget,"" Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle recently told reporters, linking last year's White House-backed tax cuts to the imminent reappearance of federal budget deficits. 
""We are taking the same approach Enron used in sapping retirement funds and providing them to those at the very top."" 
House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri mentioned Enron explicitly in the Democratic response to the State of the Union address. 
""If the nation's largest bankruptcy coupled with a clear example of paid political influence isn't a prime case for reform, I don't know what is,"" Gephardt said. ""The forces aligned against this are powerful,"" he said. 
Most Democrats support legislation to reduce the role of money in politics. GOP leaders oppose it, and Democrats have long labored to depict Republicans as beholden to special interests. 
The polling on Enron is somewhat murky. But murky isn't all that bad for the Democrats, given that Bush's approval ratings are in the 80 percent range, and that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks have elevated public concern about defense issues, which tend to favor Republicans. 
Polling also shows that Republicans gained a boost in hypothetical election matchups for Congress in the wake of last fall's terrorist attacks. 
But Democrats seized on a recent New York Times survey suggesting that the public sees Republicans as being more closely linked to Enron than the Democrats, 45 percent to 10 percent. 
Democrats have been heartened, as well, by the decision by the General Accounting Office, the congressional watchdog agency led by a Republican, to sue for records of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force. 
""I applaud GAO for standing up for the principles of the right of Congress and the people to know who helped shape the administration's energy policy,"" said Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who helped initiate the GAO investigation last April. 
Alongside the inquiry into the task force, a dozen congressional committees are investigating Enron. The party's ability to gain political ground, said one House Democratic leadership aide speaking on condition of anonymity, ""is a question of how aggressive the Senate people are who have subpoenas."" 
Thus far, Republicans profess little concern. 
""It's an issue that has to be directly addressed. The American people expect it,"" said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate GOP campaign committee. 
But with Bush scoring well in the polls, one Republican strategist said the GOP need merely ""be properly outraged where outrage is warranted."" Democrats may hurt themselves if they place too much stress on Enron and its ties to the Republicans, this official said - much like Republicans paid a price at the polls in 1998 when they sought to make the impeachment of President Clinton a campaign centerpiece. 
Yet in their memo, Carville, Greenberg and Shrum suggested how Democrats could use the Enron collapse politically. 
Referring to the first of two economic stimulus bills that Republicans pushed through the House last year, they wrote: 
""It is easy to imagine a chain of argument: an economic stimulus bill that became a corporate giveaway, including hundreds of millions more for Enron, which dodged taxes in 4 of the last 5 years.""

CBOT CEO: Enron Fall May Pull Trade To Formal Exchanges
By Jon Kamp

02/01/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- The fall of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) highlights the vulnerability of over-the-counter energy markets and could help push trade in those commodities to regulated exchanges, said David Vitale, president and chief executive of the Chicago Board of Trade.
Over-the-counter energy markets have clear benefits, including increased flexibility and lower costs to participate, Vitale said, speaking late Thursday at a Chicago conference. But Enron's rapid decline and withdrawal from those markets, which it once dominated, exposed the over-the-counter markets' significant risks, he said. 
""Enron clearly brings proof...that those risks are real,"" Vitale said. ""The OTC market is clearly a buyer-beware market."" 
Natural gas contracts, like oil contracts, are already traded heavily on the New York Mercantile Exchange in addition to over-the-counter markets. But electricity contracts change hands almost exclusively in over-the-counter markets that handled, by one estimate, nearly $450 billion in trade in 2001. 
In an interview following the conference, Vitale said he expects more exchange-traded energy contracts to emerge following Enron's fall. Though the CBOT has no specific plans to roll out such products, it's something the exchange will explore, he said. 
""It's on the agenda to look at,"" he said. 
Energy traders generally managed to unwind their Enron contracts with minimal disruption, but Enron's troubles show there can be tremendous risk-management costs for over-the-counter market participants, Vitale said. 
With those over-the-counter market costs and risks now apparent, regulated markets, which can offer standard contracts, more liquidity and the safety net of clearing functions, appear more favorable, he said. 
""The expected costs of participating in the OTC markets will rise,"" Vitale said. ""There will be a flight to quality."" 
Any attempt to shift electricity trading to regulated markets faces significant challenges. Transmission constraints that limit the ability to move power to where it is needed most make electricity a regional product, traded in a wide array of contracts centered on major transmission ""hubs"" around the U.S. It would be hard to create a standard contract for that system, Vitale said. 
Nymex launched electricity futures five years ago, but they are almost never traded. 
Exchanges and energy companies are pursuing other routes, however, that could bring the risk-mitigation benefits of a regulated exchange to over-the-counter electricity markets. Nymex, for example, began offering clearing services to over-the-counter natural gas markets last November and wants to offer clearing to power traders in 2002. 
IntercontinentalExchange, a major Internet-based marketplace backed by several large energy-trading firms and banks, also said recently that it may expand its clearing function to cover electricity. 
Exchange clearinghouses protect against default - a major concern when Enron collapsed - by stepping in as counterparty to every trade. Several large energy companies, including Williams Cos. (WMB) and Mirant Corp. (MIR), have expressed interest in the idea. 
Not all market watchers and participants agree that Enron's problems exposed energy marketplace flaws. In a mid-January address to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Pat Wood, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said Enron actually highlighted the strengths of the energy markets. 
While Enron created a headache for counterparties, those companies still managed to quickly eject Enron from the markets in what Wood called a show of ""hateful Darwinism."" 
That process ""reaffirmed my personal faith that energy markets really worked as we want them to do, which is to reward good guys and punish bad guys,"" Wood said at the time.

INDIA: Bids come in for Enron Dabhol Indian power stake.
By Anirban Nag

02/01/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

BOMBAY, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The Industrial Development Bank of India said on Friday it has received three bids for the stake held by foreign shareholders in Enron Corp's $2.9 billion Dabhol power project and the number could rise to six. 
""The fourth bidder is likely to submit its bid and sign a confidentiality agreement by this evening,"" P P Vora, chairman and managing director of the development bank, which is the lead creditor to the project, told reporters.
""There are six bidders in the race and two of them have shown interest orally. All three firms which have submitted bids have signed the confidentiality agreement."" 
He declined to name the firms, but six major companies - three foreign and three Indian - have said they are interested in bidding for the massive Dabhol plant and an adjoining LNG facility. 
The potential foreign bidders are Royal Dutch/Shell , European oil major TotalFinaElf and French utility Gaz de France . 
The possible Indian bidders are private power utilities BSES Ltd and Tata Power Company and the country's largest natural gas distributor, the Gas Authority of India Ltd . 
Vora said IDBI would appoint a financial firm next week to advise it on the bidding process. 
On Wednesday, the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) kicked off the process by inviting bids for the 85 percent foreign stake in Dabhol and fixed February 7 as the last date when potential buyers could file their expressions of interest. 
Vora said the due diligence by the bidders would start in London on February 5 or 6. 
""Our aim is to finish the entire bidding and due-diligence process in the next six to eight weeks,"" he said. 
Enron, the Houston-based energy trader which filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in early December, owns a 65 percent stake in Dabhol. 
General Electric Co and U.S.-based contractor Bechtel Corp each own 10 percent, while a provincial Indian utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) holds the remaining 15 percent. 
Dabhol had completed building the first phase and had nearly finished constructing the 1,444 MW second phase, when it halted work after the state electricity board fell $240 million behind in payments for power supplied. The 740 MW first phase began operating in May 1999. 
The facility has lain idle since June due to a dispute over the price of power between Dabhol and the plant's sole customer, the nearly bankrupt MSEB. 
POWER COST TO DROP 
Vora said the lenders, who have an exposure of nearly $1.9 billion to the project, were working on a package which would offer substantial concessions to the new buyer and subsequently lower the cost of power. 
Before the plant closed in June, the cost of power generated was around seven rupees per unit when the plant was running at about 30 percent of its capacity. 
At full capacity, the price per unit worked out to about five rupees but could be brought down to 2.70 to 2.75 rupees, according to officials. 
""We are considering reducing the interest on the rupee loans - currently at 16.5 percent - and an assurance from the Maharashtra government that the power generated will be bought,"" Vora said. The government of Maharashtra owns MSEB. 
But officials in IDBI told Reuters most of the loans were in foreign currency. 
Vora said lenders were also considering converting foreign currency debt into rupee loans and eliminating the exchange rate risk. 
A gradually weakening rupee had considerably increased Dabhol's debt servicing costs and raised the cost of power, with the local currency losing nearly 12 percent since May 1999, when the first phase of Dabhol's plant started generating power.

California Gov. Davis Calls for Enron Probe; Lawmaker Calls Enron 'Robber Baron'

02/01/2002
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Associated Press 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gray Davis and Sen. Barbara Boxer are asking federal energy regulators to investigate possible price manipulation by Enron during the state's energy crisis.
Mr. Davis sent a letter Thursday to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission following the release of a memo from Enron officials to the White House that outlines discussions between company officials and the administration's energy task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney. 
In the memo, Kenneth Lay, former chief executive of the now-bankrupt energy giant, urged Mr. Cheney to reject price caps on wholesale electricity that Mr. Davis and a host of other state officials desperately wanted. 
Mr. Davis has been asking FERC to probe possible price manipulation by power suppliers since August 2000. ""If there is any doubt in your mind about whether an investigation is warranted, the latest revelations should answer that question,"" Mr. Davis wrote. 
Ms. Boxer, calling Enron ""the first robber baron of the 21st century,"" called on FERC officials to make public any contacts they had with Enron officials while energy prices were skyrocketing in California. 
An Enron spokesman didn't immediately return a phone call from the Associated Press seeking comment. 
Ms. Boxer (D-Calif.) called the memo a ""smoking gun"" that shows how Enron helped set federal energy policy that hurt California during last year's power crisis. ""We now know why Californians needlessly lost billions during the energy crisis. We know FERC did nothing to help us because the Bush administration told them not to,"" she said Thursday in a telephone interview. ""Now I understand why we were begging for help. The cards were stacked against us for nearly a year."" 
Mr. Lay is scheduled to appear before the Senate Commerce Committee on Monday, and Ms. Boxer said she will confront him. 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said the memo shows Enron was more concerned with ""escalating gas and electricity prices, from which it benefited, than in helping to fix the broken energy market."" 
In the memo, Enron urged the administration to reject price caps on wholesale electricity and support the creation of regional transmission organizations. Enron also sought the creation of a new energy trading market that could have enriched the company's existing trading businesses. 
The White House conceded that parts of the memo resemble Mr. Cheney's energy plan, but said that doesn't reflect any improper influence. 
""The national energy policy is based on sound science,"" said Cheney spokeswoman Jennifer Millerwise. ""Nothing in there benefits a specific company or interest group.""

Fund targets employee ownership
Enron aside, manager says firms with ESOPs a good bet

By Craig Tolliver, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 3:47 PM ET Jan. 31, 2002
HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Even as the Enron debacle leads to greater scrutiny of company-stock ownership plans, one company just launched the first mutual fund to invest exclusively in companies with significant employee ownership.
Headquartered in the same city as Enron, Houston-based Capstone Asset Management recently introduced the Capstone Employee Stock Ownership Fund, a no-load portfolio investing primarily in U.S. companies with broad-based employee stock ownership programs.
""One of the things that really makes this an opportune time for the fund is the situation at Enron in that the notion of employee ownership has been tarnished by what happened -- but it wasn't employee ownership that was the problem,"" argued fund manager Dan E. Watson.
So how will Watson keep from ending up with a portfolio chock full of Enrons? 
After starting with a field of some 600 companies that offer stock ownership to more than half of their employees, Watson hopes to cull the list down to 60 to 80 solid companies using both quantitative and bottom-up analysis.
""They're very attractive in their own right, and I think that's the thing we want to emphasize, that these are good investments anyway,"" noted Watson.
Watson said, however, that had the fund started a year ago, Enron would not have been a holding, as evidenced by its absence in the firm's other actively managed funds.
Capstone, itself an employee-owned company, cited studies by various researchers suggesting that employee stock ownership leads to improved corporate performance, which could translate into improved stock market performance as well.
Never a fan of funds with a gimmick, Morningstar analyst Russel Kinnel understands the case for these types of stocks but wouldn't hold out ownership as any sort of a barometer for quality. He noted that Enron is a strong example that the system isn't foolproof.
""I would say that stock options are probably the most debatable part of the equation in that you can get some real dilution there. As we're talking about accounting issues, this is one where options are not counted as an expense or compensation. Obviously they should be,"" Kinnel observed.
Top holdings in the fund include chip stocks like KLA-Tencor and Intel Biotech concern Amgen also figures prominently in the portfolio.
""These are all good companies with bright earnings prospects in their own light and they have the other virtue of having motivated employees because of their ownership policies,"" Watson said.
The ESOP Association a Washington-based trade organization comprised of companies with employee stock ownership plans, entered into an affinity agreement with Capstone to provide information about the fund to its membership.
""The employee ownership community is very excited about Capstone's new Employee Stock Ownership Fund. For the first time, our nation will see that the many studies evidencing superior performance by employee-owned companies are real, not hypothetical,"" said association President J. Michael Keeling.
The portfolio should be of particular interest to ESOP members already sold on the concept of employee ownership because it offers greater diversification to employees of member companies beyond investing in a single company, Watson said.
The fund is available to anyone through Capstone Asset Management directly.
The no-load fund has an initial minimum of $200, or $25 with automatic monthly investments. Annual expenses have been estimated at 1.17 percent.

01/31/2002
CNNfn: Moneyline News Hour
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.
ANNOUNCER: This is LOU DOBBS MONEYLINE, for Thursday, January 31. Here now, Lou Dobbs. 
***excerpt only***
Turning to other news. Enron not cooperating with the United States Senate. That charge coming from Senator Byron Dorgan, one of the lawmakers leading a congressional investigation into Enron. 
Tim O`Brien reports from Washington -- Tim. 
TIM O`BRIEN, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT: Lou, it may be a sign of things to come: Not only have presumably important records been destroyed, but determining who now possess the relevant records that remain and getting them each to the appropriate congressional committees could be a logistical nightmare, even in the best of circumstances. 
Enron had an estimated 3,000 partnerships, some of them with names out of Star Wars, like Jedi. 
Well today, as you said, Senator Byron Dorgan, the chairman of a Senate commerce subcommittee on consumer affairs, said Enron officials, quote, ""just simply have not cooperated."" 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
SEN. BYRON DORGAN (D), NORTH DAKOTA: These off-the-books partnerships with strange sounding names are very important in terms of us understanding what has happened. We have not, at this point, received cooperation from the corporation in getting this information. We, again, renew our request. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This corporation resorted to a variety of legal, regulatory and accounting contortions to keep investors and the American public in the dark. It is now high time for the Congress to flip on the light and get to the bottom of the situation. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
O`BRIEN: Enron`s Washington lawyer, Bob Bennett, says the company doesn`t have the documents sought. Bennett says the company has been fully cooperating with the committee. He suggested that the documents may be with some of the partnerships. If so, locating them could be problematic, to say the least. 
Unraveling all of this is clearly going to take some time. You may recall one of the top auditors on the Enron account, David Duncan, last week refused testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination. 
That apparently will not happen next Monday when Ken Lay, a star witness, if not the star witness, is scheduled to testify before Dorgan`s subcommittee. Dorgan says Lay, the former CEO of Enron, has agreed to testify fully, and will not be seeking any immunity deal. 
And Lou, many of the executives who ran Enron will also be testifying before various committees here next week, including another former CEO, Jeff Skilling, who resigned unexpected only six months after assuming the top job. 
DOBBS: And whose departure seems to be the incipient point of the unraveling of Enron. 
Tim, thank you very much; Tim O`Brien. 
 
Andrew Sullivan's selective Enron outrage
The failed energy trader didn't just spend money on politicians. It gave handily to journalists, too. But why is Sullivan most angry about the one liberal who cashed in?
- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Eric Boehlert, Salon.com
Jan. 31, 2002 | It took a few months, but the press has finally managed to carve out an angle about itself in the Enron debacle: a controversy-in-a-teapot focusing on conflicts of interest for the so-called Enron pundits. 
The pundits include a group of prominent political and economic commentators who in recent years (i.e., before former CEO Kenneth Lay replaced Osama bin Laden as Public Enemy No. 1) made their way onto Enron's payroll and received big bucks for doing very little work. Now they are being asked: How in good conscience can they comment on Enron's fall after cashing Lay's obscenely generous checks? 
The Enron sugar daddies include Weekly Standard editor William Kristol ($100,000), CNBC host and National Review Online columnist Lawrence Kudlow ($50,000), New York Times columnist Paul Krugman ($50,000), Weekly Standard contributing editor and Sunday Times of London columnist Irwin Stelzer (approximately $50,000) and Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan ($25,000-$50,000; apparently she cannot recall the exact sum). 
We're assured this is a very big deal. ""The burgeoning scandal [has] replaced the war as the Beltway's reigning obsession,"" the Washington Post reported on Wednesday. 
A review of the charges makes clear that none of the Enron media players, who were all slow to cop to their Houston boondoggles, come out looking very good. But that also goes for their chief accuser, conservative columnist Andrew Sullivan. His selective prosecution raises suspicion about whether he is simply trying to right an ethical wrong or, more likely, hoping to damage one of the left's most effectively critical voices -- Paul Krugman, a former MIT economist who has landed punch after solid punch on the Bush administration over the past year. 
Right from the outset, Sullivan, using his daily online column, called for an ""investigation"" into Krugman's alleged ethical lapse. (By who, the Pundit Police? Is that run out of the Department of Justice?) He suggested Krugman and others ""recuse themselves"" from the Enron situation, the way Attorney General John Ashcroft did, since as a senator he received Enron contributions. According to Sullivan, the Times columnist should return his Enron money, just as Senator Hillary Clinton had returned the campaign contributions she'd received from Enron. (In Washington, contributions and paychecks are seen as one and the same.) 
""Disclosure is a must,"" wrote Sullivan. ""We demand it of politicians. Why should we not demand it of the journalists who police them? If it's corrupting for politicians, why is it any less corrupting for pundits, who can exercise as much power as many Congressmen and often have more influence than individual Senators? "" 
Yes, both politicians and the press depend on public trust, but the last time we checked pundits did not have the power to pass legislation, prosecute criminals or declare war. Nor were pundits answerable to the voters. Indeed, the level of importance granted by the media to this Enron media tempest is more proof than we need of the warped sense of self-importance such pundits have about themselves and their colleagues. 
The absurd levels of self-absorption are reminiscent of the time, early in George Bush's campaign, a Boston television journalist sprang a pop quiz on a befuddled W. While the cameras rolled, the reporter asked him to name several foreign leaders. Bush stumbled badly. More than a few pundits then rushed forward to defend Bush, suggesting even they wouldn't have been able to ace such a tough test. Their courage in admitting to just skimming the international news section every morning was commendable, but unlike Bush, those columnists weren't angling to become the leader of the free world. 
So, just what crimes did these pundits commit? 
Irwin Stelzer, contributing editor for the Weekly Standard and a columnist for the Sunday Times of London. 
To date, Stelzer still has not disclosed to readers how much he was paid to serve on an Enron advisory board that he helped organize. In a Weekly Standard piece about Enron last November, Stelzer defended the company by stressing there was ""no indication that the mistakes were other than honest ones, or that investors were deliberately kept in the dark or misled about the company's finances."" 
In that piece, Stelzer told readers about serving on the advisory board, but not that he was paid tens of thousands of dollars. This came after years of writing favorably about Enron without giving readers a hint of his financial ties to the company. 
Bill Kristol, editor of the Weekly Standard. 
Not much better than Stelzer's situation. Kristol collected $100,000 for serving two years on the same lightweight Enron advisory board while editing a weekly magazine that routinely covered energy and deregulation, policies Enron was actively trying to shape. It wasn't until Stelzer's column last November that readers were told about Kristol's Enron involvement. Just how much Kristol pocketed was revealed only later, by other publications. If there's an ethics crime for Sullivan to prosecute, it's the Weekly Standard's nonexistent conflict-of-interest guidelines. 
Last week, the New York Times reported that Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian Coalition, was given a plum, $10,000-per-month consulting gig at Enron at the request of Bush strategist Karl Rove. The clear implication being that the Bush camp was trying to win over Reed as an ally by using Enron's payroll. Was a similar strategy at work with Kristol? Kristol was not known as a Bush booster -- he backed Sen. John McCain in the Republican primary. Could the board membership have been designed as a way to quietly lead him to the Bush camp? Only Enron execs know the answer to that question. 
Peggy Noonan, columnist for the Wall Street Journal. 
The conservative opinion maker outed herself last Friday; in a column critical of Enron and its culture of wealth, she informed her readers that she'd once done speechwriting for the failed Houston energy company. Like almost everyone else involved, however, Noonan had trouble coming right out and telling readers how much she pocketed. Instead, she wrote that ""if memory serves,"" she earned between $25,000 and $50,000 for her work. But even those numbers were hard to come by -- readers had to calculate on their own the number of hours she worked (between ""100 to 200 hours""), and multiply that by the rate she charged ($250) in order to get the final eye-popping invoice. 
Noonan then admitted the speech she wrote for Enron wasn't very good and that only portions of it were even used. Yet going by her high-end estimate of 200 hours billed, Noonan spent five weeks straight, working 40-hour work weeks, to deliver contributions that, she conceded, ""weren't helpful."" 
After initially criticizing Noonan, Sullivan reversed course, writing that he'd been ""a little harsh"" on her and that Noonan had been ""had"" and ""used"" by the energy giant. Some at Enron might quibble with that assessment. 
Lawrence Kudlow, cohost of CNBC's ""America Now"" and an editor for National Review Online. 
Kudlow earned $50,000 for a year's consulting and two speaking fees. In his National Review column on Monday, Kudlow claimed he had been ""completely forthcoming with respect to my brief consulting role with Enron and the fees I received for this consulting."" 
Not quite. Kudlow didn't reveal his generous fees until Sullivan began his Enron pundit watch. And that was after Kudlow had already written about the company without letting readers in on his Enron finances. 
When Kudlow finally did come clean, he explained he had been ""attracted by the personable Kenneth Lay."" Not Lay's checkbook, mind you, his personality. That was odd, because in his previous column Kudlow undressed the ""characters"" at Enron (presumably including Lay) who had ""no moral fiber, no character, no courage and no corporate responsibility."" 
Also worth noting is that it took Kudlow several months to even address Enron's Page 1 debacle. That seems like an odd oversight for somebody with the title of ""financial economics editor."" Did the Enron money help keep Kudlow quiet? 
Paul Krugman, columnist for the New York Times. 
This whole game of gotcha began when the New York Times, deep in a recent Enron news story, reported that Krugman had once received $50,000 to serve on Enron's now famous advisory board. Months earlier Krugman himself had informed readers about his Enron work but conveniently left out the five-figure number. Same was true when he wrote a puffy Enron piece for Fortune magazine in 1999; the advisory board was mentioned, handsome paychecks were not. (Today, Krugman is among Enron's harshest critics.) 
Sullivan's probably correct in his surmise that the numbers were originally left out because most Times readers, and even Fortune's white-collar readers, would probably be stunned to read about that kind of pay for two days' work. 
But Krugman, who cut his Enron ties when he joined the Times in order to comply with the newspaper's strict conflict-of-interest policy, flagged his association well before Enron cratered, which is more than any of the other pundits can say. 
By Sullivan's standards, though, Krugman's the worst of the bunch, and that's where Sullivan's partisan instincts drive his accountability crusade off the track. Rather than calling all the pundits out for not disclosing their questionable Enron paydays, Sullivan largely gives the other (conservative) commentators a pass, and zeroes in on the only liberal among them. 
For instance, assessing Kudlow's Enron writings, Sullivan concluded, ""Since [his] pieces were harshly critical of Enron, there's no scandal."" Yet no pundit this year has been as harshly critical of Enron as Krugman has, so why is his work a scandal? 
Applying a sort of retroactive responsibility, Sullivan accused Krugman of ""absconding with $50,000 worth of dirty money from a criminal enterprise."" Of course, Krugman took the money three years ago, long before Enron's problems were apparent. By contrast, Kudlow was cashing Enron checks for a speech given last August, just as the company was beginning to unravel. 
Sullivan patted Kristol on the back for ""getting [his $100,000 payment] out in the open."" In the open? Kristol pocketed twice as much as Krugman, yet the Weekly Standard still hasn't printed any details about Kristol's cushy Enron payment. 
Meanwhile, Sullivan accused Krugman and the New York Times of somehow trying to cover up his Enron affiliation. ""Most readers of the Times would think [the $50,000 payment] is relevant,"" Sullivan complained. Yet how did he find out about the $50,000? He read it in the New York Times. 
Later, Sullivan bemoaned ""vast amounts of corporate cash being handed over to journalists,"" and how those vast amounts ""might actually give an appearance of conflict of interest for a journalist."" 
But was Krugman a ""journalist"" in 1999 when Enron came calling? Over the years the economist has undoubtedly been a prodigious writer, with outlets in Fortune and Slate, among others. But to suggest Krugman was a journalist the way Noonan, Kristol, Kudlow or Stelzer are is disingenuous. In 1999 He was primarily known as a MIT professor of economics who, according to his own explanation, accepted the Enron gig based on a long tradition of high-profile economics professors cashing out at the expense of corporations. 
So why, after the fact, does Sullivan try to hold Krugman to a conflict-of-interest standard his future employer would insist upon? Was Krugman supposed to know in 1999 that later in the year he'd be hired by the New York Times, and therefore he shouldn't have accepted the Enron money? 
Krugman answered his critics by claiming he was being smeared by a ""broader effort by conservatives to sling Enron muck toward their left, hoping that some of it would stick."" 
He's onto something. Clearly, Krugman's constant flurry of punches over the last year have hit the White House in the gut a few too many times for some conservatives. And his punches hurt -- Krugman is an economist who knows his topic better than the White House does. He's also untainted by the Clinton sex scandals. (He joined the Times after those bloody battles had been fought.) And he's unusually blunt in his assessment that President Bush is either a fool or a liar for pushing his tax cut strategy. 
Sullivan may have inadvertently revealed his true motivation for targeting Krugman when he immediately launched another media crusade: criticizing the New York Times' ""left-wing lurch"" in its aggressive Enron news coverage. (Specifically, Sullivan didn't think that a poll that found a vast majority of Americans felt Republicans, not Democrats, had close ties to Enron was Page 1 material.) 
There is an important lesson about politics, money and power to be learned from the Enron pundit tale, but it's not necessarily the one that Sullivan is shouting about.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By George Mannes, Senior Writer, theStreet.com
02/01/2002 08:07 AM EST
5. Where Was Adam Schiff's Sage Counsel When We Needed It Most?
A thousand apologies to Andersen attorney Nancy Temple, of whom we made fun last week for her small but noteworthy role in Enron's ongoing accounting debacle. 
As you may recall, we chided Temple's need-not-to-know behavior -- her response to an urgent email about whether Enron might mislead the public in an impending earnings release. Temple's impulse apparently wasn't actually to be helpful but to ask the questioner to keep her name out of all correspondence so she wouldn't have to testify. 
Well, as the Five Dumbest Things in-house counsel informed us this week, Temple Did the Right Thing. As squirrelly as it might seem to the layperson, Ralph the Lawyer tells us it's standard operating procedure for an attorney to tell a client not to blab to the world about conversations they've had, because that's a sure way to lose the sacred attorney/client privilege of confidentiality. Any half-decent lawyer (we pray that includes Ralph) would do the same thing. 
Oops. Forget about that conversation with Ralph. It never happened. We learned about that privilege stuff from, uh, the Encyclopaedia Britannica. 
Anyway, we're sorry not only for making that mistake last week, but also for losing the opportunity, then and now, to make fun of Dumber stuff in the Enron/Andersen/accounting universe -- stuff like the shredding by the brilliantly named Shredco, the destitute family of ex-CEO Ken Lay and the wacky ""isolated error"" that caused Anadarko Petroleum to overlook a $1.7 billion writedown. 
Oh well. There's always next week.

Ex-Enron exec who questioned company's finances dies in suicide 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle staff and wire reports 
Jan. 25, 2002, 12:16PM
A former Enron Corp. executive who challenged the company's questionable financial practices and resigned last May was found shot to death in a car in Sugar Land today in what was ruled a suicide, authorities said. 
Enron officials confirmed the death this morning of J. Clifford Baxter, 43, former vice chairman of the embattled Houston company. 
His body and a note were found at 2:23 a.m. today between two medians in the 5200 block of Palm Royal, near his home in an upscale residential area in Sugar Land. He was in the driver's seat of the vehicle and a police officer stopped to check on him after noticing the parked car. 
The officer discovered what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Baxter's head. Police did not reveal the contents or nature of the note. 
Precinct 4 Justice of the Peace Jim Richard of Fort Bend County ruled Baxter's death a suicide mid-morning today. Richard said the car was locked and Sugar Land police had to break a window to get in. He said Baxter's body was in the driver's seat with a pistol in his hand. 
Richard initially decided the death was an obvious suicide and there was no need for an autopsy and the body was taken to a nearby funeral home. About noon, however, he indicated that an autopsy might be warranted. 
""We don't have any other indication other than it being suicide,"" said Sugar Land police Capt. David Marcaurele. 
Baxter was vice chairman of Enron when he resigned in May 2001, several months before the energy company's collapse. 
""We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our friend and colleague, Cliff Baxter,"" said an official company statement today. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends."" 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer had no additional comment. 
Baxter was identified by name in the explosive warning that Enron executive Sherron Watkins wrote last August to company chairman Ken Lay. 
""Cliff Baxter complained mightily to (then-CEO Jeff) Skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM,"" one of the partnerships that kept hundreds of millions of dollars in debt off Enron's books. 
Watkins identified Baxter in a section of her letter stating there is ""a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor,"" another entity involved in the partnerships. 
Watkins' letter to Lay stated that ""we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals"" unless the company halted practices that eventually sent it into bankruptcy. 
Baxter was the lead negotiator on Enron's purchase of Portland General Electric in 1997. 
He was one of 29 former and current Enron executives and board members named as defendants in a federal lawsuit. Plaintiffs' lawyers said the executives made $1.1 billion by selling Enron stock between October 1998 and November 2001. 
It said Baxter had sold 577,436 shares for $35.2 million. 
According to the May 2001 press release, Baxter was to have continued working for the company as a consultant. 
Baxter was born Sept. 27, 1958 in Amityville, N.Y., received a bachelor's of science from New York University in 1980 and an MBA from Columbia University seven years later. He was a captain in the U.S. Air Force, 1980-85. 
Baxter had joined Enron in 1991 and was chairman and CEO of Enron North America prior to being named chief strategy officer for Enron Corp. in June 2000 and vice chairman in October 2000, the company said. 
Baxter resigned from Enron months before the company imploded amid revelations of questionable financing and overstated earnings. 
Enron's downfall began in mid-October with the release of a $618 million third-quarter loss and a $1.2 billion writedown of shareholder equity. Subsequent revelations of partnerships that allowed Enron to keep half a billion dollars in debt off its books and elimination of millions in profits with restated earnings since 1997 fueled the company's descent into the largest bankruptcy in history on Dec. 2. 
In the May 2001 resignation announcement, Skilling said, ""Over the past 10 years, Cliff has made a tremendous contribution to Enron's evolution, particularly as a member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business. 
""His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career. While we will miss him, we are happy that his primary reason for resigning is to spend additional time with his family, and we wish him the very best."" 


Former Enron exec Baxter dead
Vice chairman who left in May apparently killed himself

By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 1:13 PM ET Jan. 25, 2002
HOUSTON (CBS.MW) - The Enron saga took a tragic turn after former Vice-Chairman J. Clifford Baxter, who resigned his post in May 2001, died of an apparent suicide, police said Friday. He was 43.
""We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our friend and colleague, Cliff Baxter,"" Enron said in a statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.""
According to police in Sugar Land, Texas, outside Houston, Baxter was found dead in his car Friday with a gunshot wound to his head. Police said they found a suicide note and no sign of foul play.
""From our investigation everything points toward (suicide),"" said Captain David Marcaurele of the Sugar Land Police Department. ""He was found in his vehicle in Sugar Land with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was dead at the scene and the sole occupant in the vehicle.""
A Sugar Land police officer stopped to check on the driver of the car because it was parked in residential area between two medians, Marcaurele said.
Details of the suicide note were not being released Friday. Marcaurele declined to comment on the contents.
Baxter was most recently working for Enron as a consultant. In a letter Enron employee Sherron Watkins wrote to former Chairman Ken Lay in August, she mentioned Baxter as she questioned the company's accounting practices. 
""Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM,"" Watkins wrote. Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, abruptly resigned his post in mid-August.
Former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow created and managed the two LJM partnerships. Related-party transactions conducted within the partnerships cost Enron and caused the company to take a $1.2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter of 2001.
The transactions led to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. The revelation of the equity reduction along with a $1 billion third-quarter charge the company began the process that led to Enron's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2.
Baxter joined Enron in 1991 and was chairman of Enron North America -- the crown jewel of the now bankrupt company -- until he got the job of chief strategy officer of the corporation in June 2000. Enron named Baxter vice-chairman in October 2000.

Former Enron Executive Baxter Kills Self, Police Say
2002-01-25 13:28 (New York)

     Sugar Land, Texas, Jan. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Corp. Vice Chairman John Clifford Baxter, who criticized secret partnership agreements that bankrupted the energy trader and spawned federal investigations, committed suicide, said police in Sugar Land, Texas. He was 43.

     Baxter's body was found in his car at 2:23 a.m. with ``an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,'' according to a statement e-mailed by police to Bloomberg News. ""Baxter was dead at the scene and the sole occupant of the vehicle. A suicide note was found at the scene.''

     Baxter, who helped build Enron's wholesale energy trading business, resigned in May after a decade with the company. He had clashed with former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling and ""complained mightily'' about the ``inappropriateness'' of partnerships used to keep debt off Enron's books, Vice President Sherron Watkins said in a letter released by U.S. investigators.

     Baxter was one of six Enron directors named as defendants in at least 40 investor lawsuits claiming the company concealed losses that led to Enron's bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2.

     ""We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our friend and colleague, Cliff Baxter,'' Enron said in a faxed statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.''

Sold Shares

     Baxter made $42.4 million from selling nearly 654,000 shares of Enron stock over the past four years, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. He was responsible for strategy, including acquisitions and divestitures, spokeswoman Karen Denne said at the time of Baxter's resignation.

     Baxter was named Enron's chief strategy officer in June 2000. Before that, he was chairman and chief executive of Enron North America.

     Baxter and his wife gave $10,000 to the Republican National Committee in the last election cycle, according to FECInfo, which tracks campaign finance.

     Baxter served five years in the U.S. Air Force, retiring as a captain in 1985. He attended New York University and Columbia University business school. He was born in Amityville, New York.

     Mark Frevert, Baxter's successor, left the company at the end of December.

     The House Energy and Commerce Committee had planned to subpoena Baxter, Representative Jim Greenwood said. He declined to say why or what the committee would ask Baxter.

     Sugar Land is a small community southwest of Houston.

Former Enron Executive Found Dead

By KRISTEN HAYS, Associated Press Writer
9:42 AM PST, January 25, 2002 

HOUSTON -- A former Enron Corp. executive who challenged the company's questionable financial practices and resigned last May was found shot to death in a car today, an apparent suicide, authorities said. 

Police in the suburb, Sugar Land, confirmed the death of 43-year-old J. Clifford Baxter, a former Enron vice chairman. He was shot in the head. 

""We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our friend and colleague, Cliff Baxter. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends,"" the company said in a statement. 

Spokesman Mark Palmer had no additional comment. 

Baxter was vice chairman of Enron when he resigned in May 2001, several months before the energy company's collapse. 

Baxter was identified by name in the explosive warning that Enron executive Sherron Watkins wrote last August to company chairman Ken Lay. 

""Cliff Baxter complained mightily to (then-CEO Jeff) Skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM,"" one of the partnerships that kept hundreds of millions of dollars in debt off Enron's books.

Enron's Baxter 'Complained Mightily' About Transactions

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- J. Clifford Baxter, the Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) executive who committed suicide Friday, resigned from the company last May after he ""complained mightily"" about the inappropriateness of certain financial transactions that sent the Houston energy-trading giant into bankruptcy by year-end.
Baxter, a former vice chairman at Enron, ""complained mightily to Skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM,"" Enron executive Sherron Watkins said in an August memo to Kenneth Lay, who resigned this week as the company's chairman and chief executive. 
Watkins sent the memo anonymously, concerned that increasing investor scrutiny in the wake of the surprise August resignation of Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling would uncover the facts about the transactions and Enron would ""implode in a wave of accounting scandals."" 
LJM was one of the special-purpose entities Enron established to take its debt off the books, inflating earnings and the company's stock value. Losses incurred through the partnership led to the company's historic financial collapse last year. 
Baxter was among seven top Enron executives reported to have earned millions from insider stock sales last year.

"FW: Daily Lunches","Tom, want me to start ordering lunches just for our group?  I could even take specific orders for what each person likes, and have them bill us or put it on someone's credit card.  I can do that for just the EOL guys, too.  I found out that the deliveries are going to ECN, and the clerks are picking them up from there.  Well, at lunchtime, I could take a dollie with me to carry it all, and/or have Michael Salinas help me.  I don't know ... whatever you'd like.  That's just a suggestion that I have, if you would still like to pull away from the daily lunches for the whole floor.  I've noticed a lot of our guys don't like the lunches, and they sometimes go get food from the Energizer.  We still get billed for their food, even if they don't eat.  

Let me know if you'd still like to do this, because it's definitely possible.

Laura

P.S. - I just thought of another suggestion ... I could make Peanut Butter & Jelly sandwiches for us!!!!  YEAH!

Can you guys please prepare a coordinated list of no more than 35 people that can come in on Sunday between 2- 6:00 pm to test trading applications.  Due to the combination of the moves (over 900 people) the IT group wants to ensure that your applications are functioning properly before Monday morning.  

The list should be weighted heavier towards those folks who can identify system problems rather than unpacking boxes.  There will still be alot of the move team on the floor finishing installations etc.  

Please provide the list by end of business today (thursday).  

Thank you!

"Sunday 12/18/01 WX 4KZ","Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:

"Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum - June 20, 2001","Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate in an Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to those who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past few years.  These informal, interactive forums will be approximately 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.  

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although attendance is not mandatory, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do ""reality checks"", create a ""rallying point"" and ensure Enron's executive management is on the ""same page"" about where Enron is going---and why.

We realize that individuals based outside the United States will not want to make a special trip to attend the meeting, but may be able to attend one of the sessions while they are in Houston on other business.  We also hope to schedule a similar session in London later this year.

We currently have a session planned for:

Wednesday, June 20, 2001 from 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Houston, EB50M

The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here's how it will work:
?	Each session will have approximately 25 participants.
?	The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
?	This will be your forum. Don't expect to simply sit and listen to presentations.
?	This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own questions and express your own opinions.
?	You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum.
?	Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not limited to: the
direction of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activities, projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we encourage you to accept this invitation only if you intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do the same.  We also ask that you refrain from canceling your attendance once enrolled so that we will not have to cancel the forum.  The Office of the Chairman is very willing to take valuable time from their busy schedules to hold these forums.  Enrollments will be on a first come first served basis and we hope you would be able to honor your commitment to attend.  For planning purposes, it is essential that you RSVP no later than Monday, June 11, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586.

We will confirm your registration with you, in writing and forward a list of enrollees to the Office of the Chairman.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson via e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806.  

Thank you.

Enron says repayment of 690 mln usd debt extended until mid-Dec

11/21/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
HOUSTON (AFX) - Enron Corp said its creditor banks have granted an extension on a 690 mln usd note payable by Nov 27 until mid-December, giving it enough time to restructure the debt. 
In a statement, the troubled energy company said the extension has been agreed following talks with its main creditor banks on restructuring its debt to avoid a liquidity crisis.
""We have been in continuous contact with our banks and believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to enhance our cash position, strengthen our balance sheet and address upcoming maturities,"" said chief financial officer Jeffrey McMahon. 
Enron first informed investors of the possibility it would be forced to repay the 690 mln usd note in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. 
The obligation arose after Standard & Poor's cut the company's long-term debt rating to BBB- last week, forcing it to either post collateral on the note or repay it on maturity. 
Enron said it has also secured the remaining 450 mln usd of a previously announced 1 bln usd credit line from JP Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney. The facility is secured by the assets of Enron's Northern Natural Gas Co unit. 
The other 550 mln usd are secured by the assets of its Transwestern Pipeline Co. 
Enron also said it is still committed to its merger with Dynegy Inc, announced on Nov 9. 
""We continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders, employees, and lenders,"" said chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay. ""It offers the opportunity to create a formidable player in the merchant energy business with substantial growth prospects and a strong financial position."" 
JP Morgan Chase vice chairman James Lee said the bank will work with Enron and its other creditor banks ""to develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to and through its merger with Dynegy"", which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2002.

USA: Enron secures credit line as shares fall.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. said on Wednesday it secured the remaining $450 million of its $1 billion credit line and reaffirmed its commitment to an agreement to be taken over by rival Dynegy Inc. 
Facing a crisis of confidence, Enron said it is in active talks with its other lenders to restructure its debt obligation and had pushed back the deadline for repaying a $690 million loan obligation to mid-December.
""We continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders, employees, and lenders,"" Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay said in a statement. 
Enron shares were down 28 percent after noon on Wednesday, after being down 33 percent earlier in the day. Its shares fell about 23 percent on Tuesday amid concerns over its liquidity and growing questions over whether the proposed takeover by Dynegy would go ahead.

Enron stock free-fall continues

11/21/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - Shares of embattled Enron Corp. plunged another 32 percent Wednesday morning as analysts and investors continued to doubt the once-mighty energy trader's ability to recover lost business and investor confidence. 
In a report released Wednesday, Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst David Fleischer became the latest to question Enron's future, saying that an SEC filing by the Houston-based company earlier this week ""raised new issues about liquidity and the ability of the company to even finance itself over the next several months.""
Analysts are also questioning whether Dynegy Inc.'s planned dlrs 8.9 billion acquisition of Enron will survive given the latest revelations. 
Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Enron late Monday restated the company's third-quarter earnings and stated that it may have to repay a dlrs 690 million debt by next week because of decreased credit ratings. 
The filing also noted that Enron's financial woes have led to a ""reduced level of transaction activity"" with the company by trading partners. 
Enron shares fell 23 percent Tuesday, then dropped another dlrs 2.25, or 32 percent, to dlrs 4.74 Wednesday in extremely heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Fleischer said Enron's Nov. 16 cash balance of dlrs 1.2 billion is inadequate to meet remaining debt obligations. 
Fleischer acknowledged, however, Enron's efforts to renegotiate next week's due date for the dlrs 690 million debt, which was triggered Nov. 12 when the company's credit rating was downgraded to BBB-, saying that there are indications that Enron's banks may be willing to roll current maturities over and even make new equity investments. 
Michelle Foss, director of the Energy Institute at the University of Houston, said this latest round of troubles had to raise concerns about whether the Dynegy-Enron deal will be pulled off. 
""It doesn't look like it's going to be able to happen,"" Foss said. ""It did look like a decent idea when they proposed the merger, but today I'm sure they'll look at it and see if they can salvage their attempt to buy Enron."" 
Shares of Dynegy were off dlrs 2.55 to dlrs 39.15 in trading on the NYSE.

Tobacco suits by Venezuela, Brazil's Espirito Santo dropped 
MIAMI (AP) - Health care cost-recovery lawsuits against major U.S. cigarette makers by Venezuela and the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo have been dismissed. 
""This is another important reminder to American plaintiffs' lawyers that a state court won't ignore the overwhelming number of decisions by federal courts rejecting these lawsuits,"" William S. Ohlemeyer, Philip Morris Cos. vice president, said Tuesday after the decisions. 
Attorneys for several foreign governments have filed an assortment of lawsuits in U.S. federal and state courts in an attempt to find some legal mechanism that withstands judicial scrutiny. 
Russia and other Brazilian states are among the foreign governments that have sued in Miami, where a verdict of dlrs 145 billion was awarded to Florida smokers against the five biggest U.S. cigarette makers. 
Ecuador's suit in Miami was withdrawn earlier when another state judge announced his intention to dismiss it.

General Motors of Canada inks supplier agreement with Quebec rubber plants 
Eds: Dollar figures are Canadian. 
MONTREAL (AP) - General Motors of Canada has signed supplier agreements with a Quebec auto-parts maker that helped create about 800 jobs, news reports said Wednesday. 
The deal with Saar-Gummi Automotive Group in Magog, Quebec, is part of General Motors' commitment to offset the jobs that will be lost when it shuts down its car assembly factory in Boisbriand, Quebec, next year, killing 1,400 jobs. 
GM did not reveal the value of the contracts, but German-based Saar-Gummi said Tuesday it has made a dlrs 40 million investment in its seven Magog plants, doubling its workforce to 1,600 employees from 800 since last summer. 
The factories make molded rubber parts for cars, such as the rubber strips and molding found along the doors of vehicles. Most of the production is sold to GM, and goes into 56 GM plants in Canada, the United States and Mexico. 
The products will be used in several models including the Chevrolet Avalanche, GMC Envoy, Saturn VUE and Cadillacs.

Enron Closes On $450M Secured Credit Line

11/21/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Co. (ENE) closed on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion in secured credit lines and said it is in active discussions to restructure its debt to improve liquidity. 
In a press release Wednesday, Enron said the $450 million credit facility is secured by the assets of Enron's Northern Natural Gas Co.
A $550 million credit facility, secured by the assets of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline Co., closed Nov. 16. The proceeds are being used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations. 
The company said it was informed by the lead bank on the facility that the maturity on its $690 million note payable obligation will be extended to mid-December. Enron expects the extension to be finalized shortly. 
Dow Jones Corporate Filings Alert reported Monday that Enron is currently preparing a restructuring plan aimed at taking aggressive steps to rationalize the company's existing cost structure, accelerating the process of divesting noncore businesses and assets and restructuring scheduled maturities of debt and other obligations. 

Enron's credit lines are from J.P. Morgan, the investment-banking arm of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), and Salomon Smith Barney, the investment-banking arm of Citigroup Inc. (C). 
Enron also reaffirmed its commitment to the merger with Dynegy Inc. (DYN). On Nov. 9, Enron and Dynegy signed a definitive merger agreement that would give Enron shareholders 0.2685 share of a Dynegy share. The merger is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2002. 
On Monday, Enron filed its Form 10-Q for the third quarter, which reflected a wider loss by 3 cents a share. The energy company previously reported a loss of $618 million, or 84 cents a share, on revenue of $47.6 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron shares fall further on credit concerns.

11/21/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. shares tumbled 33 percent in early trading on Wednesday, following a 22.8 percent drop on Tuesday, amid concerns over the company's liquidity and growing questions over whether the proposed takeover by Dynegy will go ahead. 
Enron's shares were down $2.29 to $4.70 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock was the biggest loser by percentage and the most active stock on the NYSE.
""The Dynegy deal will take a long time and a lot of things could happen over that time period. Dynegy did their homework, but if they missed anything, they have a number of exit opportunities,"" said Fulcrum Global Partners analyst Michael Barbis. 
Dynegy was not immediately available for comment. 
Wall Street analysts said Enron is losing market share because of credit concerns from its trading partners and questions over Dynegy Inc.'s takeover offer. Enron warned on Monday it could be forced to pay by next week a $690 million debt triggered by a credit downgrade last week. 
""Enron is definitely losing market share on credit concerns. Cash needs to run the buisness have now increased. The market perceives Enron as needing more cash,"" said Barbis. 
On Monday, Enron disclosed it is up against a deadline of Nov. 26 to deliver collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its many partnerships. 
If not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which include a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. 
Enron is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat. 
On Monday, the Houston-based company also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share.

Upgrades and Downgrades

CNNfn: Market Coverage - Morning
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.
RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNNfn ANCHOR, MARKET CALL: Time now for upgrades and downgrades. 
Salomon Smith Barney downgrades Microsoft (URL: http://www.microsoft.com/) to neutral from outperform saying the company`s earnings estimates too aggressive in light of the economic conditions.
Goldman Sachs, as we heard from Chris, removing three energy firms; Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) , Dynegy (URL: http://www.dynegy.com/) and Williams (URL: http://www.williamsenergy.com/) , from the recommended list. 
Dynegy was expected to buy the troubled Enron. It is still, but it`s rated market perform now as is Enron. Williams rated market outperform. Goldman says it`s concerned about Enron`s ability to recover from the loss of significant business deals and sees no positive catalysts for the entire group largely due to the problems in Enron. 
On the upside, Deutsche Bank is raising Xerox (URL: http://www.xerox.com/) to buy from market perform saying it`s pleased with the company`s turnaround strategy. We`re going to talk about that in detail when we speak with the analyst who made that call in just a moment. 
First, we want to take a look at how these stocks are trading. Entire group is down with the exception of Xerox. It`s up 15 cents. 
Peter Ausnit is imaging analyst at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown and joins us. 
And thanks for joining us here on MARKET CALL. What is it about Xerox you like? 
PETER AUSNIT, IMAGING ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK ALEX. BROWN: Well I think the company`s really put its liquidity concerns behind it and now investors can look at the long-term picture, which is much brighter. 
CHARLES KADLEC, J&W SELIGMAN: Peter, it`s Chuck Kadlec. Good morning. Is this is a heroic recommendation here? Is this - should we consider this more of a speculative investment or is this something that a conservative investor ought to be interested in? 
AUSNIT: I think investors should be interested in this if, over the next several quarters - in the near-term, the conditions are still quite difficult but over the long-term it`s not that speculative. Xerox has a large install base, a tremendous sales and service force and can probably return to industry standard margins. 
KADLEC: As you say, this probably depends on management`s ability to execute here. Why do you believe this management is going to be able to execute their strategy? 
AUSNIT: Well their track records during the turnaround has been fairly strong and the strategy has made a lot of sense. They`ve sold a lot of businesses. They`ve done most of the things they promised to do such as bring on new third party equipment financing and they`re going to bring on a new CFO as well. 
SCHAFFLER: Peter Ausnit of Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, thanks for joining us.

Enron Gets Extension on $690 Mln Note Due Next Week (Update1)
2001-11-21 12:38 (New York)

Enron Gets Extension on $690 Mln Note Due Next Week (Update1)

     (Updates with amount of debt in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose shares had
dropped 92 percent this year amid a financial crisis, said lenders
extended to mid-December the payment date on a $690 million note
due next week.

     Enron, which agreed to be bought out by rival energy trader
Dynegy Inc. in a transaction now valued at more than $23 billion,
said earlier this week a drop in its credit rating may force it to
repay the $690 million note. The repayment would strain cash
reserves Enron needs to back its trading operations, investors and
analysts said.

     The Houston-based company didn't say in its release who holds
the note, which is owed by an affiliated partnership that owns
Brazilian natural-gas assets and was backed by Enron.
     The note is held by a group of banks led by the Citibank unit
of Citigroup Inc., Standard & Poor's said in a press release
yesterday.

      Enron also is in discussions with other lenders on a
restructuring of its debt, the company said in a statement
distributed by PR Newswire.

     ``We believe the interests of Chase and Enron's other primary
lenders are aligned in this restructuring effort,'' James Lee,
vice president of JP Morgan Chase & Co., said in the Enron
statement. ``We will work with Enron and its other primary lenders
to develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to
and through its merger with Dynegy.'' Morgan has been advising
Enron on its merger with Dynegy.

     Enron said yesterday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debt
due by 2003, suggesting the company may run out of cash before the
merger closes. Dynegy has said the merger should close before the
end of the third quarter of 2002.

      Enron said in a regulatory filing that it has less than $2
billion in cash or credit lines.

     Shares of Enron, the most active stock in U.S. trading, fell
$1.79, or 23 percent, to $5.20 in midday trading. Before the
announcement that it had renegotiated the $690 million note, its
shares had fallen as much as 42.78 percent, the lowest level in
more than a decade.

     Dynegy fell $2.50, or 6 percent, to $39.20. Shares of
ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, rose 49
cents to  $87.02



Enron, Dynegy Shares Fall 2nd Day on Threat to Buyout (Update2)
2001-11-21 11:49 (New York)

Enron, Dynegy Shares Fall 2nd Day on Threat to Buyout (Update2)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 21, (Bloomberg) -- Shares of Enron Corp., the
biggest energy trader, and Dynegy Inc. fell for a second day on
concern Enron may run out of cash before its takeover by Dynegy
can be completed.

     Enron tumbled as much as 33 percent, and Dynegy dropped as
much as 6.7 percent. Enron's bonds also fell. The company's 6.4
percent notes maturing in July 2006 were bid at 62 cents and
offered at 66 cents, traders said. They sold at about 72 cents
yesterday.

     Institutional investors sold shares of both companies after
Goldman, Sachs & Co. analyst David Fleischer downgraded them to
``market perform'' from his ``recommend'' list, other analysts
said.

     The Dynegy bid ``did not eliminate customer concerns about
Enron's liquidity and long-term viability,'' Goldman Sachs said
in its report. ``We now believe that it will be difficult for
Enron shares to generate strong returns until it is clear that
Enron can operate on a normal basis without having to provide
cash or letters of credit to back routine transactions.''

     Fleischer also cut his 2002 profit estimate for Enron to 50
cents from $1.35. Enron had been expected to make $1.90 next
year, the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call.

     Enron said Monday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debt
due by 2003, suggesting the Houston-based energy trader may run
out of cash. The company said in a regulatory filing it has less
than $2 billion in cash or credit lines.

     It also surprised some investors by saying a drop in its
credit rating may force it to repay a $690 million note next
week. Enron said yesterday the terms of the notes, which it
guaranteed for an affiliated partnership that owns Brazilian
natural-gas assets, are being renegotiated and that it had a
``verbal indications'' that the maturity of the notes will be
extended.

     The company's dealings with affiliated partnerships led to
earnings restatements, credit-rating cuts, a federal
investigation and a management shakeup. Dynegy plans to complete
its buyout by October, and Enron may have to ask lenders to
restructure payment schedules.

     Mirant Corp., Aquila Inc. and other big energy traders are
doing fewer transactions with Enron as concerns increase about
its credit rating and ability to finance daily business,
executives said yesterday.

     Enron's stock fell $2.28, or 32 percent, to $4.71 in
late-morning trading. Earlier, it touched $4.67, its lowest price
in more than a decade. The shares have plummeted 92 percent this
year. Dynegy fell $2.70, or 6.5 percent, to $39.00. The shares
had dropped 26 percent this year.

San Diego City Council approved an agreement for the company to
deploy automated external defibrillators in the region. The
company made the announcement in a press release distributed by PR
Newswire. Officials couldn't immediately be reached to comment.

     Guidant Corp. (GDT) rose $4.18, or 8.9 percent, to $51 and
traded as high as $51.50. The maker of products to treat heart
disease said a study showed implantable defibrillators cut deaths
by 30 percent in heart-attack survivors, potentially expanding the
$1.9 billion market for the product.

     Portal Software Inc. (PRSF) fell 34 cents, or 15 percent, to
$1.89 and traded as low as $1.64. The provider of Internet-billing

     Money flows, the difference between the value of trades made
at a higher price than the previous trade and those made at a
lower price, may also appear for some stocks. These inflows and
outflows show whether people are willing to pay more for a stock
that's rising, or to sell a stock that's falling for less. If not
it's a signal the share price may soon change direction.

Enron (ENE <http://tscquote.thestreet.com/StockQuotes.jhtml?tkr=ENE>:NYSE - news <http://tscquote.thestreet.com/BBNews.jhtml?tkr=ENE> - commentary <http://find.thestreet.com/cgi-bin/texis/cmttkrfind/results.html?tkr=ENE&site=tsc> - research <http://thestreet.multexinvestor.com/search.asp?Ticker=ENE> - analysis) <http://www.riskgrades.com/clients/thestreet/index.cgi?tickers=ENE> shares plunged a second straight day Wednesday as fear mounted that the struggling energy trader's bailout merger plan will unravel. 
A potentially lethal cash crunch appears to be gripping Enron, even though its planned acquirer Dynegy (DYN <http://tscquote.thestreet.com/StockQuotes.jhtml?tkr=DYN>:NYSE - news <http://tscquote.thestreet.com/BBNews.jhtml?tkr=DYN> - commentary <http://find.thestreet.com/cgi-bin/texis/cmttkrfind/results.html?tkr=DYN&site=tsc> - research <http://thestreet.multexinvestor.com/search.asp?Ticker=DYN> - analysis) <http://www.riskgrades.com/clients/thestreet/index.cgi?tickers=DYN> has injected $1.5 billion of cash, and banks have opened new credit lines. An Enron collapse would cause weeks of dislocation in the energy markets that would damage other energy traders, and it would cause big losses for the Houston company's creditors. 
Just before noon EST, Enron announced in a press release that it had extended to mid-December a $690 million obligation that was due next week. It also said that it had agreed with its bankers to draw down the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion secured credit line that has J.P. Morgan Chase as its lead banker. 
Investors have been fleeing Enron since the company last month disclosed a $1.2 billion writedown to unwind some related-party hedging transactions. The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing Enron deals with related parties. The October disclosure made investors uneasy because it suggested the company hadn't been forthcoming about the true state of its finances, and it showed that Enron was facing serious liquidity problems. 
Those fears were temporarily quieted earlier this month when Enron agreed to be acquired by smaller rival Dynegy. But Enron's disclosure Monday that it faces additional earnings and financing troubles renewed the rush to the exits. In the Wednesday release, Enron CEO Ken Lay said his company was still committed to the merger: ""We continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders, employees and lenders."" Dynegy later issued a press release indicating it is ""continuing our confirmatory due diligence"" regarding the merger. Neither Enron nor Dynegy returned calls seeking comment. 
After plunging 23% Tuesday to $6.99, Enron was down a staggering 34% at one point Wednesday. It moved slightly higher after the midday press release to trade at $4.90. Enron shares have lost more than 80% of their value since the company issued its third-quarter earnings release last month. Dynegy dropped $2.44, to $39.26, though it remains substantially above premerger levels. 
At the heart of Enron's trouble is the sense that the company isn't letting on the full extent of its troubles. The selloff in Enron shares began in earnest Oct. 16, when the company disclosed in an earnings conference call that it would take a $1.2 billion writedown to unwind some related-party transactions. Critics of the company said those deals, in which the company did business with separate entities involving Enron managers, raised serious ethical and disclosure issues. 
The Dynegy merger was taken as a vote of confidence for Enron, since as a big trading partner Dynegy would appear to have a solid grasp of Enron's situation. As a result, shares in both companies rallied after the deal's announcement. But Monday's disclosure that Enron faced $690 million in bond payments next week reignited worries that the company faced steeper challenges than it has detailed. According to a Merrill Lynch report cited in The New York Times Wednesday, Dynegy wasn't aware of the $690 million obligation. Critics of the deal wondered whether Enron had told Dynegy about all its obligations. <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10003860.html> 
Liquidity fears have also been rekindled by information contained in a filing of quarterly results that show the company consumed as much as $5 billion of cash in recent weeks. By the end of 2002, Enron has to find around $9 billion to pay back various obligations. It had $1.2 billion in cash on hand as of Nov. 16, according to the filing. 
Tellingly, Dynegy shares haven't plunged along with Enron, suggesting that investors see a collapse of the merger as catastrophic for Enron but not for Dynegy. At current levels, Enron shares are trading at more than a 50% discount to the Dynegy offer. 
J.P. Morgan has taken a leading role in helping Enron. It has lent funds and it helped restructure the $690 million obligation. The bank's stock was down 78 cents to $38.62. ""We will work with Enron and its other primary lenders to develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to and through its merger with Dynegy,"" said James Lee, a top banker at Morgan, in the Enron release.

DYNEGY, ENRON SAY MERGER TO PROCEED

By Myra P. Saefong

1:52 PM ET Nov 21, 2001

WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- Merger partners Enron and Dynegy restated their
commitment Wednesday to completing a deal, on the heels of embattled
Enron's announcement that its lead lender granted it more time to pay
off a $690 million note set to come due next week.

""We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to
accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger,""
said Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive,  in a
statement.

Shares of Enron (ENE) recovered slightly in afternoon  trading but
remained under pressure.


On heavy volume, the stock -- which had touched $4 earlier in the
session -- was down $1.83 to trade at $5.16, a new 10-year low. Some 84
million shares had changed hands.

Enron declined 23 percent Tuesday after the company revealed the
upcoming debt deadline and restated its earnings.

Meanwhile, Dynegy shares lost $1.83 to stand at $39.87.

Enron said that the lead bank on the $690 million debt agreed to extend
the maturity date to mid-December, which will give the company time to
restructure the facility, and added it expects to further restructure
its debt.

""We ... believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to
enhance our cash position, strengthen our balance sheet, and address
upcoming maturities,"" said Jeff McMahon, chief financial officer, in a
statement.

J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. said it and other lenders are committed to
helping Enron improve its financial position.

Also, Enron reaffirmed its commitment to a merger with Dynegy and said
it closed on a previously announced $450 million line of credit from
J.P. Morgan, collateralized by the company's Northern Natural Gas Co.

Enron -- which is being acquired by its smaller rival Dynegy (DYN) at a
fire-sale price -- revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission
filing Monday that it had to pay off or refinance $690 million in debt
obligations by next Monday or risk triggering nearly $4 billion in
additional payments.

If Enron had missed that deadline and didn't post collateral, investors
had the right to demand immediate liquidation of the assets of one of
Enron's limited partnerships, the unusual business entities at the
center of the company's murky transactions currently under
investigation.

The SEC filing of Monday also contained yet another restatement of
financial results on the heels of a similar filing that disclosed more
than four years of restated earnings figures.
<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B35D690E0%2D13BE%2D43D9%2D9644%2D1B1CF4896115%7D>

Earlier Wednesday, Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on Enron's stock to
""market performer"" from its ""U.S. recommended list,"" citing ""major""
liquidity issues and concerns over whether the company can recover the
business it has lost.

CIBC World Markets also cut Enron to a ""hold"" from a ""buy.""

Commerzbank weighed in Wednesday, saying Enron's viability is in doubt.

""We believe the filing clearly shows that Enron remains in a precarious
financial position and its status as a going concern is much in doubt,""
analysts Andre Meade and Andrew Smith wrote. ""It appears that Enron's
situation could worsen in a number of ways.""

Though Enron's most recent disclosures shed more light on the fiscal
situation, Meade and Smith characterized the information as ""piecemeal.""

""It appears that the full extent of Enron's problems is not currently
known,"" they said in a note, cautioning clients against investing in
Enron.

Enron Says It Won't Issue Release on 4th-Qtr Results
2002-01-02 16:10 (New York)
Bloomberg

     Houston, Jan. 2 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the energy trader which filed for bankruptcy last month, won't announce its fourth-quarter results until March, spokeswoman Karen Denne said.
     The company, once the top energy trader, will include the results in a mandatory quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, known as a 10-Q.
     ``That's what's required,'' Denne said. ``Earnings and the balance sheet will be out at the same time this year.''
     Shares of Houston-based Enron rose 3 cents to 63 cents. They fell 99 percent last year. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2.

Senate Democrats Launch Probe of Enron Collapse With Subpoenas
2002-01-02 15:09 (New York)
Bloomberg

     Washington, Jan. 2 (Bloomberg) -- The Senate Government Affairs Committee launched a probe of Enron Corp.'s collapse by issuing subpoenas for documents from the company's officers, directors and accountants.
     Senator Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who chairs the committee, said the subpoenas kick off ``a search for the truth, not a witch hunt,'' into questions such as whether analysts misled investors by touting Enron after they should have known it was in trouble.
     ``The suddenness with which this company fell is shocking,'' Lieberman said at news conference. ``Even the savviest investors on Wall Street were blindsided'' by an event that Lieberman said shook ``public confidence in the stock market.''
     The first hearing is scheduled for Jan. 24, the second day the Senate will be in session. The hearing will focus on Enron's use of energy derivatives and the lack of regulatory authority over its trading operations, Lieberman said.
     The subpoenas for documents are being sent to the officers and directors of the company since 1999, as well as Enron's auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP.
     Several other congressional committees are investigating Enron's bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history, which sent its shares from $84.06 a year ago to 64 cents in afternoon trading. The Senate probe has political implications because it will be run by Democrats, and Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay is a friend of and fundraiser for Republican President George W. Bush.

                         Lay to Be Called

     Lay and former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling will eventually be called to testify, Lieberman said. Lay thus far has declined to appear before other committees.
     ``I will not consider the investigation complete without hearing from Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling,'' Lieberman said.
     Lieberman, who ran for vice president in the 2000 election as Al Gore's running mate, said he would look into Lay's connections to the Bush administration and the formulation of its energy policy.
     ``Some executives of Enron had close relationships with people in the Bush administration,'' Lieberman said.
     Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the top Republican on the committee, has been consulted about how to run the investigation in a nonpartisan fashion, Lieberman said.

                         SEC Investigating

     The Securities and Exchange is investigating whether Enron Corp. illegally hid the size of its debt from shareholders before collapsing in November. Also conducting probes are the House and Senate energy panels; two subcommittees of the House Financial Services Committee; and the Senate Commerce Committee's consumer
affairs subcommittee.
     Representative Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, has asked Vice President Dick Cheney to provide information ``about secret contacts'' that Cheney's energy task force had with Enron officials.
     The Government Affairs Committee is the top investigative panel in the Senate and was used by Republicans to probe former President Bill Clinton's Whitewater involvement and 1996 presidential campaign fundraising.

USA: UPDATE 1-Congressional panel turns up heat under Enron.

(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Fallen energy giant Enron Corp. faced further scrutiny on Capitol Hill on Wednesday with another committee announcing a probe of the company's collapse, possibly looking at connections between Enron and the White House. 
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's permanent subcommittee on investigations said it will subpoena documents next week and scheduled a hearing into the matter for Jan. 24.
""Enron's unexpected collapse raises some troubling questions that the governmental affairs committee will be asking,"" said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who chairs the full committee. 
A Wall Street darling just a few months ago, Enron on Dec. 2 made the largest bankruptcy court filing in U.S. history after a rescue takeover by rival Dynegy Inc. fell apart amid investor concerns about Enron's murky finances. 
Houston, Texas-based Enron is now under investigation in Washington by the market-regulating Securities and Exchange Commission, the departments of Justice and Labor and at least five congressional committees. 
In response to questioning at a briefing, Lieberman said he would not rule out the committee looking into ties between Enron and the administration of President George W. Bush. 
""It's a matter of public record that executives of Enron had close relationships with people who are now in the Bush administration. They also had close relations with some Democrats,"" Lieberman said. 
Several of Enron's top executives were major backers of Bush's election campaign, as well as those of other Washington politicians. 
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay ""and others played an active role in the formulation of energy policy by the Bush administration,"" Lieberman said. 
""We've got to ask whether the advice rendered was at all self-serving,"" he said. ""There are some interconnections here with the Bush administration but that is not the focus of this investigation."" 
Sen. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the permanent subcommittee, said the investigation would focus on the role of Enron's directors in the collapse, the accounting firm Andersen in its audit of Enron's financial statements, and the company's use of complex financial partnerships. 
Once ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of top companies, Enron's stock was trading up 4 cents, or 6.7 percent, at 64 cents a share on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading on Wednesday, off from an August 2000 high of $90.56. 
Thousands of Enron employees lost their jobs and much of their savings. A 401(k) retirement plan that made many of them heavily dependent on company stock came under fire at a congressional hearing last month when employees said they were unable to sell their holdings when the stock price plunged. 
""I'm particularly concerned with reports that top executives at Enron were selling their shares of company stock at very high profits while lower-level employees were forbidden from selling theirs,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican and ranking minority member of the permanent subcommittee. 
The Wall Street Journal, citing internal company documents, reported on Wednesday that top Enron officials knew about financial partnerships involved in the company's downfall and were aware of possible conflicts of interest. 
""Something was very rotten in the state of Enron,"" Levin said, adding that his subcommittee would look into what appeared to be ""layer upon layer of conflicts of interest."" 
Lieberman said no decision had been made on whether to subpoena Lay or other Enron executives. Asked whether SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt would be called before the committee, he said, ""We will be calling Mr. Pitt.""

Enron's Lay to testify to Congress in Feb after backing out of prior hearings

01/02/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - Enron Corp chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth Lay has informed Senate lawmakers that he will appear before Congress in February to testify on the energy group's collapse after he failed to attend two similar hearings in December, Congressional aides told AFX News. 
Lay has been invited to Congress to answer lawmakers questions on the events surrounding Enron's collapse -- the largest corporate bankruptcy in US history -- before the Senate Commerce Committee which is due to hold a hearing into the affair on Feb 4.
""Enron's chairman has indicated that he will be testifying,"" said a spokesman for Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan, who is scheduled to chair the hearing after Congress returns from its winter break in late January. 
At two previous hearings in December, Lay declined to appear before Congress to testify at the last minute, prompting several lawmakers to caution him in his absence that Congress has the power to subpoena witnesses if it desires. 
Congress is trying to discover if Enron withheld any material information from its auditors. 
Lawmakers also want Enron to answer questions about the freezing of its employees' pension funds, and they are also seeking to find out why Lay divested millions of dollars of Enron stock earlier this year prior to investors losing billions of dollars in the failed company.

Enron: CFO Shouldn't Testify At Change-Of Venue Hearing

01/02/2002

NEW YORK (AP)--A lawyer for Enron Corp. (ENE) argued in bankruptcy court Wednesday that the Houston-based energy company's chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, shouldn't have to answer questions at a hearing next week to decide whether to move the trial from New York to Houston. 
""It's not a subject on which he's competent to testify,"" said Howard Comet of the law firm Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP.
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez delayed any ruling until Friday, giving Comet time to try and convince lawyers representing Dynegy Inc. (DYN), as well as others seeking to move the trial, that no Enron executives should have to testify at the hearing scheduled Monday. 
Dynegy, an Enron rival, backed out of a deal to buy the company after once-mighty Enron said it was in worse financial straits than it had originally disclosed. 
A lawyer for Dynegy, H. Rey Stroube, said he wants at least one Enron executive to explain why the company believed it was important for the case to be heard in New York instead of Houston and whether money could be saved if the case were administered in Texas. 
Comet told the judge that he would try to answer that question, and others, by Friday afternoon, when the parties reconvene in a conference call to discuss the matter, although he said it would be a ""practical impossibility"" to do so. 
Analysts say that Dynegy and other parties suing Enron believe they would get a more favorable hearing in Houston, whose economy has suffered greatly as a result of Enron's demise. 
If Stroube were still unsatisfied Friday and the judge sided with him, Comet said he would be willing on Monday to call into court the chief counsel of Enron North America, Mark Haedicke, to explain why the parent company filed for bankruptcy in New York.

IN THE MONEY: Enron DIP Financing Likely To Shrink
By Carol S. Remond

Dow Jones News Service

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE)'s $1.5 billion rescue package may be scaled back amid lingering apathy among bankers recruited to take part in the loan.
Enron's better-than-anticipated cash position, now that the company has stopped servicing its debt, coupled with the lack of appetite of banks tapped to help syndicate Enron's debtor-in-possession, or DIP, financing is likely to result in a smaller loan, people familiar with the matter said. 
The interim financing was first negotiated by Enron's two lead lenders, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C) in early December shortly after the energy trader filed by Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. 
Final approval of the DIP was first scheduled for Jan. 7, but has since been postponed to the end of the month. 
DIP financing is crucial to allow bankrupt companies to continue operating. Enron's original loan package was approved by judge Arthur J. Gonzalez on Dec. 3. A first $250 million installment was made available to Enron but has yet to be tapped by the company. 
People familiar with the matter said Enron provided its two lead lenders with a business plan this past weekend. That should, upon review and approval by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, open the door for the release of another $250 million. 
But it's now unclear whether all or any of the remaining $1 billion will be made available to Enron. 
Under the original DIP package, the $1 billion is contingent on a number of conditions, including full syndication of the loan and the filing for bankruptcy of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline to secure the return of $550 million to J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup. (The $550 million is part of a separate $1 billion financing deal put together by the two banks in mid-November as they rushed to try to keep Enron out of bankruptcy.) 
J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup floated a syndication term sheet to other large banks in mid-December but found that most were reluctant to take on more exposure to Enron. The DIP loan carries a 350 basis points (3.5 percentage points) over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), interest rate. 
Banks traditionally agree to provide DIP financing as a way to assure they'll be able to recoup some of their existing exposure to a company that has filed for bankruptcy. Those loans are seen as safe because, under bankruptcy law, they're most senior and are repaid ahead of anything. 
In the case of Enron, however, worries about how much of the company's outstanding loans can be recouped and the relatively large exposure of some financial firms, have many rethinking more Enron financing. 
It's unclear whether the Transwestern Pipeline, one of Enron's prized assets, will file for bankruptcy if the DIP is cut back. 
If not, J.P. Morgan and Citigroup will likely have to keep the $550 million revolver loan they made to Enron in November on their books, instead of getting that cash back. That means the banks will likely end up owning at least part, if not all, of the TransWestern Pipeline which is used to collateralize the loan.

=DJ US Govt Affairs/Enron-2:Enron, Andersen To Get Subpoenas
2002-01-02 15:26 (New York)
Bloomberg
 
  At a Capitol Hill press conference Wednesday, Lieberman and Levin promised a
sweeping probe of the company's internal decision making and potential
conflicts of interest, and why auditors and Wall Street analysts failed to warn
investors of the company's problems. 
  Ultimately, the committee aims to determine what changes in federal
regulations and oversight are needed to prevent a recurrence of Enron's
financial implosion. 
  ""The suddenness of this company's fall was shocking. Even the savviest
experts on Wall Street were blindsided,"" Lieberman said. 
  After emerging in the 1990s as a Wall Street darling, the company's stock
price was trading at more than $80 a share a year ago. 
  But Enron's equity value collapsed after it became known how the company
overstated its earnings by nearly a half billion dollars since 1997. The
company reduced its equity value by $1.2 billion in the fall, and Enron filed
for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2 with shares selling for less than a dollar. 
  The collapse cost investors billions of dollars and wiped out the retirement
savings of thousands of Enron employees while top executives collectively sold
stock worth about $1 billion. 
  The committee will hold its first hearing Jan. 24, one day after Congress
convenes, Lieberman said. The investigation will seek to uncover ""the flaws in
our system that allowed so many people to be victimized by Enron's collapse,""
he said. 
  Lieberman said the committee's probe is intended to identify what steps
government agencies should take to prevent another financial collapse like
Enron's. 
  The investigation will be ""a search for the truth, not a witch hunt,"" he
pledged. 
  Nevertheless, Lieberman acknowledged concerns about Enron's political
influence with the Bush administration, particularly Enron Chairman Ken Lay's
role in helping frame the White House's energy-policy blueprint issued last
May. 
  The committee is engaged in ""a search for the truth"" that ""will go where the
investigation takes us,"" he said. 
  Still, Lieberman noted Enron's ""close relations with some Democrats"" and
emphasized that political influence wielded by Enron won't be a focus of the
probe. 
  Levin said his subcommittee would issue subpoenas Wednesday to Enron's board
of directors and top company executives seeking documents related to decisions
involving the establishment of offshore partnerships the company formed, with
the involvement of key company executives. 
  Those special-purpose entities engaged in stock and energy derivatives
trading at the core of Enron's financial problems. 
  Next week, the subcommittee will issue subpoenas to Arthur Andersen, Enron's
outside auditor, Levin said. 
  The subcommittee will delve into ""what appears to be layer upon layer of
conflicts of interest"" involving the transfer of Enron debt to the
partnerships, Levin said. 
  ""Something was very rotten in the state of Enron,"" Levin said. Either laws
and regulations were violated, or those laws and regulations were inadequate to
prevent Enron's problems from occurring in the first place, he said. 
  ""A lot of people were either duped or didn't care,"" Levin said of the
involvement of company officials, Wall Street analysts and auditors. 
  ""Something this massive should never happen again and it shouldn't have
happened in the first place,"" the subcommittee chairman said. 
  While implicitly critical of the failure of government agencies to prevent
Enron's debacle, Lieberman noted that government ""can't protect from every
angle, particularly with a company that was prepared to violate the law, as
this company appeared willing to do."" 
  The Governmental Affairs Committee investigation marks the fourth
congressional panel to initiate a probe of Enron's collapse. The Senate
Commerce Committee is delving into the matter, as are the Energy and Commerce
and Financial Services committees in the House. 
  Lieberman defended his committee's interest in the matter and pledged to
cooperate with other congressional committees in its investigation. The
Governmental Affairs Committee was ""uniquely created to investigate something
like this,"" Lieberman said. 
  Levin called Enron's financial collapse ""a multifaceted problem."" With so
many aspects to explore, there is ""more than enough"" room for another panel to
weigh in, he said. 
  An Enron spokeswoman Wednesday declined to comment regarding the committee's
probe. The company deferred to its outside legal counsel, Robert Bennett, for a
response to Lieberman's assertion that Enron was willing to break the law.
Bennett, who represented former President William Clinton in the Paula Jones
case, was not immediately available.

Andersen Announces Results of Audit Quality Peer Review

01/02/2002
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire)

CHICAGO, Jan. 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Andersen today announced that its system of accounting and auditing quality has been deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards, following the most extensive peer review in the firm's history. Deloitte & Touche's report, which includes an unmodified opinion for the review year ended August 31, 2001, has been accepted by the Peer Review Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) SEC Practice and is available at the AICPA, http://www.aicpa.org/members/div/secps/index.htm . 
Every three years since 1978, major accounting firms, under the oversight of the Public Oversight Board (POB), have been engaged to conduct reviews of the accounting and auditing practices of member firms in the AICPA SEC Practice Section (SECPS). The scope of this year's peer review of Andersen was expanded after financial reporting issues emerged at Enron Corp. Andersen requested, and Deloitte & Touche had separately concluded, that expanded procedures were appropriate. Deloitte & Touche independently determined the scope of the expanded peer review procedures.
In total, the peer and Andersen's internal practice review covered 240 Andersen audit engagements in over 30 Andersen offices and the Andersen national office. The engagements reviewed by Deloitte & Touche reviewers and Andersen practice review teams involved some 45 percent of Andersen's U.S. audit partners. The engagements selected for review represented a cross-section of Andersen's accounting and auditing practice with emphasis on higher-risk engagements. It included examining working paper files and reports and interviewing engagement personnel. 
Deloitte & Touche's opinion was ""unmodified,"" without qualification. However, three issues not deemed significant enough to affect the opinion were raised in an attached comment letter. Such comments are not unusual in peer review reports. The comments related to: documentation of certain auditing procedures on some engagements; communications with audit committees in some instances; and management representation letters that needed more tailoring in some instances. 
In its response to Deloitte & Touche's comments, Andersen said it had taken, or would take, the steps recommended to improve its accounting and auditing practices.

Enron, Economy, Market Woes Weigh On Banks' 4Q >C BK JPM
By Tara Siegel Bernard

01/02/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- There are a handful of words that will consistently dot the fourth-quarter earnings statements of the nation's largest banks - the economy, Enron and Argentina.
Those are the culprits behind the quarter's feeble profits, reflecting the continued drag of the soft economy on financial firms, exacerbated after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center that shuttered financial markets for four days. 
A string of banks - including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Bank of New York Co. (BK), FleetBoston Financial Corp. (FBF) and some smaller institutions - have already prepped investors with announcements that their quarterly results would be light. The banks cited the rising number of loan defaults, weak capital markets, poor returns on venture capital investments and costs tied to restructuring operations. 
""This outlook incorporates the weak economic backdrop together with the natural tendency for fourth-quarter earnings to include 'clean-up' items,"" analyst George Bicher of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. wrote in a research note. 
Some of the cleanup involves sweeping bad loans off their books. Enron Corp. (ENE), the beleaguered Houston energy concern, filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, in a move that shields the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize. Enron's problems have branched out across Wall Street and the banking industry like tentacles, and some of its largest lenders - including J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) - will feel the sting. 
Adding to the credit quality pressure is Argentina's financial and political crisis, not to mention rising loan losses across the board. 
""With the consumer continuing to hold up relatively well thus far, the focus is clearly on commercial credit,"" said analyst Mike Mayo of Prudential Securities Inc. 
While market-sensitive revenue is likely to rise from the third quarter, it's still weak overall. Merger-and- acquisition activity was still meager, and losses are expected from venture capital portfolios as managers write down investments, analysts noted. 
Equity underwriting improved and debt underwriting should log healthy results, although it's not expected to hit the record levels of earlier in the year.

Citigroup Consumer Unit Helps Results 

Citigroup, the nation's largest bank, is expected to earn 73 cents a share, up from 63 cents in the third quarter (including a merger charge, it earned 61 cents), and 65 cents in the comparable quarter a year earlier, according to a Thomson Financial/First Call survey. The consumer business, which includes Citigroup's credit-card and consumer finance operations, is expected to post strong results. Though costs to cover bad loans will likely rise modestly, they will be offset by higher fees and improved net interest margin yields - or the difference between the bank's cost of funds and what it charges on loans - as funding costs dropped with falling interest rates. 
The Enron factor will likely dent results a bit: The unsecured portion - or the amount of the loan not backed by collateral - of Citi's estimated $900 million exposure to Enron is estimated at between $300 million and $400 million, analysts said. On the Argentine front, where Citigroup is one of the two largest foreign banks along with FleetBoston, the company could incur a loss of one to two cents a share, analysts said. 
J.P. Morgan Chase said that as a result of Enron's failure, it would take a charge of $220 million in the fourth quarter on top of a $235 million reduction in trading revenue. In December, the New York financial services company released more specifics on its exposure to Enron which totals $2.6 billion, up from the $900 million figure J.P. Morgan initially disclosed. About $2 billion of the total is secured. Argentine loan losses may also chip into results. Venture capital is another likely sore spot, as the firm will probably have to write down the value on some investments. Other market-related businesses, including trading, are expected to be weak. 
J.P. Morgan, the nation's second-largest bank with $712 billion in assets, is expected to earn 36 cents a share, compared with 51 cents in the third quarter (including merger and restructuring costs, it earned 22 cents), and flat with the fourth quarter a year earlier. 
Bank of America, the nation's third-largest bank with $625 billion in assets, said in November it would meet analysts' fourth-quarter expectations of $1.25 a share. That's slightly below third-quarter earnings of $1.28 (including costs tied to sales of two businesses it earned 51 cents), but ahead of the 85 cents a share in the comparable quarter a year ago. 
Credit quality will also take center stage at Bank of New York. The company said earlier this month that it would take a $275 million charge, largely to cover costs to dispose of its exposure to 24 emerging telecommunications companies and an energy-trading company (Enron). The bank has a total of $758 million in loan commitments to the companies and $488 million in loans outstanding. However, the bank said it will record an initial insurance recovery of $175 million from the terrorist attacks - it had several buildings within blocks of the WTC, including its headquarters. The recovery payments will partially offset those credit costs, and so the bank said it expects the items to reduce fourth-quarter earnings by six cents a share. 
At the time of the announcement, analysts' expected fourth-quarter earnings of 50 cents. The bank expects to meet that number, excluding the charge of 6 cents a share. That compares with 52 cents in the third quarter (including charges of 19 cents a share tied to the Sept. 11 attacks, it earned 33 cents) and 50 cents in the comparable quarter last year. The consensus earnings estimate for the latest quarter is now 47 cents a share.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) - Indiana's two largest public pension funds plan to join a federal class-action lawsuit against Enron over millions of dollars the funds lost when the energy giant's stock collapsed. 
The Public Employees Retirement Fund and the Teachers Retirement Fund report they collectively lost about $24.2 million from the drop in Enron's stock value. Managers hope to recover that money for the pension funds that have a value of about $18 billion.
""We will certainly be involved as a plaintiff in this action,"" William Butler, executive director of the employee fund, told The Indianapolis Star. ""As long as there is any prospect for recovery, I think it is incumbent on us to protect our members' money."" 
Several states - including Ohio, Georgia, Washington and Florida - have sought to direct the nationwide lawsuit, which claims that Enron illegally misstated its financial health. 
Compared with other states, Indiana's funds were not hit hard. The teacher fund lost about $2.25 million of its $6 billion, and the employee fund lost roughly $22 million of its $12 billion. 
Fund managers said the losses would have no effect on present or future payouts. 
""Twenty-two million dollars is not insignificant by anyone's measure,"" Butler said. ""But when you look at it in the context of the whole fund, it's thankfully not a very big number."" 
About 150,000 workers, mostly state and local government employees, pay into the employee fund, with about 49,000 retirees or their families are drawing from the fund. 
The teacher fund includes about 80,000 working teachers and 35,000 retirees. 
William Christopher, director of the teacher fund, said he expected his board would move to sue the company. 
""It's our responsibility to do that,"" he said. ""Even though we just weren't exposed (to Enron) a great deal."" 
Indiana's constitution prohibited the government employees fund from investing in stocks until an amendment was approved in 1997. 
Proponents maintained that investing in the market would increase fund growth over time. 
Most of Indiana's investment in Houston-based Enron was in stock groupings that mimicked the S&P 500, managers said. 
Enron, which until recently was the country's seventh biggest company in revenue, filed the largest ever U.S. bankruptcy case Dec. 2 after rival Dynegy Inc. backed out of an $8.4 billion takeover offer. 
Enron's stock price fell from more than $85 a share a year ago to about 26 cents. 
New York state, which also is suing Enron, said it lost $58 million of its $112 billion pension fund in the plunge. Ohio's two largest funds, one for public employees and another for teachers, lost a combined $114.5 million.

Azurix Extends Waterworks Concession 3mths.

Azurix Corp.AZX 
Azurix BA, the waterworks concessionaire for Argentina's Buenos Aires province, will continue to provide services for the next three months rather than stepping down this month as announced in October, a provincial official told BNamericas.
The Enron-controlled company and the province will use the three-month period to work on a smooth transition and iron out financial differences, said the official, from Buenos Aires' works and public services ministry. 
Authorities are mulling two possible courses to take when Azurix finally leaves: launching an auction to select a new private operator or turning waterworks services over to the province. 
Azurix, which has been plagued with quality and service related problems, began its 30-year concession to serve 2.5 million residents of 49 districts in 1999, but called short its tenure due to the province's alleged ""serious breaches"" of concession terms.

Hi Jeff,
 
Becky said she faxed a request for the Klein High pool and followed up with a phone call.  She was given no indication that someone else had already put in a request and our request was already on the coach's desk.  The school did indicate that pool fees are going up Jan 1, 2002.  I'm sure that will show up on the contract they send us.  They will send the contract to Becky Miller (Oak Creek Village) and she will call me when she receives it.  See you at the pool!

Enron To Tap Restructuring Expert To Replace Ex-CEO Lay
By Christina Cheddar

Dow Jones News Service

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Who Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) taps to replace Kenneth Lay as the company's chief executive will provide clues about the future shape of the bankrupt company.
Lay resigned late Wednesday amid pressure from the company's creditors committee. Enron, once the nation's largest energy trading company, now is preparing a search for a chief restructuring officer to serve as an interim chief executive. 
In an e-mail to employees, Lay said, the restructuring specialist would join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations. 
The decision was applauded by Enron's creditors committee, which is using its clout to exert its will over how the company reorganizes in order to protect its interests. 
""The creditors committee is pleased with Ken Lay's and the Enron board's decision regarding Ken Lay's departure,"" said Luc Despins, a partner at Milbank Tweed, the firm representing Enron's creditors committee. 
""The creditors committee views this as a step in the right direction to maximize value for all creditors. The committee is encouraged that Enron is proceeding with the retention of a chief restructuring officer,"" he said. 
Despins declined to comment on what qualities the creditors committee would be looking for in a candidate, or how long the process might take. 
Sources familiar with turnaround efforts and executive recruitment said the process will be swift, and a decision could be made in few days. 
These people say Enron's next step will be to form a search committee made up of members of the creditors committee and the board. Next, the committee would work with a recruitment firm to identify candidates and make a selection and offer to the candidate. He or she would need to be approved by the bankruptcy court, one of the sources said. 
Enron spokesman Vance Meyer said he couldn't immediately comment on the details of the selection process. However, he said, Enron was in ""an active search."" 
There is a small pool of turnaround experts that come to mind, one executive recruiter said. The list includes individuals such as Robert S. Miller, currently chairman and chief executive of Bethlehem Steel Corp. (BS). 
Miller, who is best known for negotiating the 1980 loan bailout of Chrysler Corp, wasn't immediately available to comment. However, through a Bethlehem Steel spokeswoman, he said he remains committed to helping restructure the Bethlehem, Pa., steel company. 
""I made a personal commitment in September 2001 to the board of directors and to the employees of Bethlehem Steel Corp. to work with the firm until it was on stable ground,"" Miller said. 
Beyond executives who specifically deal in restructuring, there are those like financier Carl Icahn, who are famed for their ability to dismantle a company and eke out the value of its assets. 
Although it isn't necessary that the individual come from the energy industry, knowledge of the sector is helpful. 
Whoever is chosen, the person's reputation and background will say a lot about the strategy Enron's board and its creditors committee plan to take in the restructuring, said John Challenger, chief executive of Challenger Gray and Christmas, a Chicago-based outplacement firm.
As for Lay, he will remain on Enron's board. 

In his email to employees Wednesday, Lay cited the distractions caused by ""multiple inquiries and investigations"" as one factor contributing to his decision to resign. 

Both Lay and Earl Silbert, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney representing Lay, weren't available for comment. 

Lay's departure follows other recent exits. Vice Chairman  Mark Frevert left at the end of December, and Greg Whalley, Enron's president and chief operating officer, will join Swiss bank UBS AG (UBS), which acquired Enron's trading operations on Jan. 18. 

Both Frevert and Whalley were part of Enron's office of the chairman. The lone remaining member of office of the chairman is Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon, who was named chief financial officer after Andrew Fastow was forced to resign. 

Questions regarding an off-balance sheet financing vehicle run by Fastow sparked the initial inquiry into Enron's finances by the Securities and Exchange commission. 

Enron's Myer said he wasn't immediately sure whether others would be promoted to the office of chairman. 

Other departures include that of Mike McConnell, who was president of Enron Global Markets. 

According to Meyer, some of the resignations reflect Enron's restructuring efforts. 

Since filing for bankruptcy protection in early December, some of Enron's assets have been sold off or have  suffered.

USA: White House - Lay resignation will not deter probe.

01/24/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The resignation of Enron Corp chairman Kenneth Lay will not deter the administration from seeking answers to the energy trading firm's spectacular collapse, a White House spokesman said on Thursday. 
Asked about Wednesday's resignation of Lay, a friend and major political supporter of President George W. Bush, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, ""Nothing changes the determination of this administration to help protect people's pensions.""
""I know that no matter what happens to one individual there, even if that individual is a friend of the president's or is a supporter of the president's, nothing is going to stop the president and this administration from pursuing justice,"" he said. 
Enron is facing multiple congressional and federal investigations over its collapse, which threw thousands of employees out of work and devastated investors, including employees whose pension plans were heavily invested in Enron stock.

Enron auditor ripped as hearings open 
Congressional probes of energy firm's collapse begin

Surrounded by counsel, David Duncan invoked the Fifth Amendment Thursday in order not to testify before a Congressional panel investigating actions surrounding Enron's collapse.

MSNBC STAFF AND WIRE REPORTS

WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 -  The chairman of a House panel investigating Enron's collapse asserted Thursday that the shredding of records by Enron accountant Arthur Andersen clearly 'compounded the catastrophic business failure' of the energy giant. Top Andersen executives responded to the criticism by telling the panel that David Duncan, its lead partner for auditing Enron's books, was largely responsible for the most of the destruction of documents sought by government investigators.

AS EXPECTED, Duncan refused to testify at the House hearing, invoking his right under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. 
       Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., said that the decision by Duncan not to testify ""will hamper the important work of this committee in our search for the truth that what transpired at Andersen during the critical period we are examining."" 
       The hearing came a day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who has close ties to President Bush, resigned his post. 
       As the House panel pursued the document destruction at Andersen, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committees planned to question former regulators and other experts on whether the government failed to exercise proper oversight of Enron. 
       The Securities and Exchange Commission started looking into Enron's accounting in mid-October, after the company reported a third-quarter loss of more than $600 million. The agency's inquiry eventually included demands for financial documents from Enron and Andersen. 
       Enron's slide into the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2 left thousands of employees without jobs and their retirement savings all but gone because the funds had been tied largely to now-nearly worthless Enron stock. Other investors and creditors also have lost hundreds of millions of dollars.
       At least 11 congressional committees plan hearings on the collapse of what once was the nation's seventh-largest corporation. 
       While reports emerged this week of document shredding at Enron's Houston headquarters as well, the focus of the House subcommittee, for the time being, is on the destruction of Enron-related papers at Anderson at a time last fall when the energy giant was descending toward bankruptcy.
       Last week, Andersen fired Duncan because of his role in Enron-related document destruction in October and November, just as Enron's problems were publicly emerging and the SEC began a formal investigation. 
       But Duncan has claimed to investigators that he was following company guidance on document destruction laid out in an Oct. 12 e-mail from Andersen corporate attorney Nancy Temple at the firm's Chicago headquarters.
       Temple and Dorsey Baskins Jr., managing director of Andersen's professional standards group, were expected to be quizzed by the House panel as to why the memo was written and on the firm's normal paper shredding policies. The company claims the Temple memo was routine and aimed only to combat the ""pack-rat"" mentality of many accountants. 
       Duncan's interpretation of the Oct. 12 memo reflected a sinister view, one supported by another Andersen manager, Michael C. Odom, who also has told investigators he viewed the memo as unusual. He also has been subpoenaed to testify.
       And a new Andersen document, obtained from committee sources Wednesday, also suggests the Temple directive was more than routine. In the Oct. 24 memo from a manager, employees were told the document shredding was so important that it should be pursued even ""on an overtime basis, if necessary for the remainder of this week or for however long it takes."" 
       Investigators also may question Temple about a warning by Duncan last October that Enron's explanation for huge third-quarter losses might be misleading investors. Duncan expressed his concerns to Enron officials on Oct. 15, a day before the losses were announced with no change, according to several memos made available by the House subcommittee.
       But if lawmakers had hoped to hear from Duncan, they have been disappointed.
       Robert Giuffra Jr., one of Duncan's attorneys, informed the subcommittee 
       Wednesday that the Duncan has not had time to prepare, has not had access to critical documents and will testify only if given immunity - as is his right under the Fifth Amendment.
       ""Mr. Duncan seeks the full disclosure of the truth"" and will continue to cooperate with the congressional investigations as well as those by the Justice Department and the SEC, Giuffra wrote.
       Kenneth Johnson, a spokesman for the full committee, said the panel did not want to impede a criminal investigation at the Justice Department, so it rejected the immunity request as well as a request by Duncan that he not be required to appear.
       
ANDERSEN OFFICIALS DECRY SHREDDING

       Meanwhile, Andersen partner C.E. Andrews and Andersen managing director Dorsey Baskin, in written testimony to the House subcommittee, said the destruction by Duncan was wrong and that the auditing firm has taken steps in response.
       ""Our investigation indicated that he directed the purposeful destruction of a very substantial volume of documents - and in doing so, he gave every appearance of destroying these materials in anticipation of a government request for documents,"" the two said.
       Duncan has said through his lawyers he did not do anything wrong but was simply following instructions from Temple and is cooperating with government investigators.
       ""The case of Mr. Duncan was clear enough to allow us to draw conclusions about his responsibility at an early stage of the inquiry. That is not true of other Andersen personnel who were involved with the destruction of documents,"" the two Andersen executives told the House subcommittee on oversight and investigations.
       ""Our investigation into the destruction of documents by Andersen personnel is far from complete,"" they said.
       
The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.


Enron Executives Depart, Trader Seeks New Leaders
2002-01-24 16:00 (New York)

     Houston, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. executives are leaving the company as it struggles to survive the largest U.S. bankruptcy case, while creditors began exerting power to salvage the remains of the fallen energy trading giant.
     A day after Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay resigned amid pressure from the creditors, the company stepped up the search for new management to rescue it from oblivion.
     Officials at three New York-based consulting firms that specialize in turning around failing businesses are the front runners to replace Lay, people close to the company said. They areAlvarez & Marsal, Glass & Associates Inc. and Zolfo Cooper LLC, the people said.
     ``My guess is Enron will get sold off in pieces and the creditors will be left to fight over the bones,'' said Al Koch, chief operating officer of turnaround consulting firm Jay Alix & Associates.
     Creditors are concerned Enron may be worth less than they thought, analysts say. That means they're likely to get a fraction of the more than $40 billion they're owed.
     With Lay's departure, Enron plans to choose a turnaround specialist to run the company until a permanent replacement is found, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. For now, Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon and Stan Horton, chairman and chief executive of Enron Global Services, are in charge, Palmer said.

Perceptions

     Deborah Hicks Midanek, a senior official at Glass & Associates, declined to comment on whether her firm might be named to lead Enron's reorganization.
     ``Stabilizing perceptions'' of Enron is of paramount importance, she said. ``Enron needs to restore confidence that the company is being handled in a responsible manner.''
     Bryan Marsal, co-head of Alvarez & Marsal, declined to comment. His partner, Tony Alvarez, is chief executive officer of apparel maker Warnaco Group Inc.
     Stephen Cooper of Zolfo Cooper didn't return phone calls seeking comment.
     Lay's resignation was intended to fend off appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee in the case, experts say. A Chapter 11 trustee would supplant Enron's top officials and its board of directors.
The trustee would likely name a new law firm to replace Weil, Gotshal & Manges as Enron's bankruptcy attorneys.
     A group of creditors led by Wiser Oil Co. and Nuevo Energy Co., former Enron trading partners, has asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez in Manhattan to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee to run Enron's North American operations.

`Fed Up'

     ``Motions by creditors to appoint a trustee or administrator is a clear indication that they are fed up,'' said Nancy Rapoport, dean of the University of Houston Law Center. ``There's a lack of confidence in Lay.''
     Lay's attorney, Earl Silbert, and Luc Despins, an attorney for Enron's creditors' committee, didn't return phone calls.
     To oust management and have a trustee appointed, creditors must show management has been incompetent or committed fraud, said Patrick A. Murphy, a lawyer with San Francisco's Murphy Shenemen Julian & Rogers.
     Document shredding and suggestions the true state of the company's financial health was covered up might be adequate grounds to name a trustee, lawyers suing Enron said.
     ``If this were a smaller case, this would result in the instant appointment of a trustee,'' said David M. Bennett, a Dallas lawyer representing some Enron creditors.
     Enron's slide into insolvency has devastated its executive ranks. Of the 14 executives listed in the company's annual 10-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in April, at least half, including former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling and former Vice Chairman Clifford Baxter, are no longer with the company.

Departures

     Vice Chairman Mark Frevert said in interview that he left the company at the end of the year. Frevert said he ``really can't say'' whether he quit or was fired.
     Greg Whalley, president and chief operating officer, is set to join Swiss bank UBS AG, which acquired Enron's trading operation on Jan. 18, according to the sale documents.
     In early December, Enron paid $55 million to 500 employees to persuade them to stay at the company for 90 days. Three-fourths of the employees held positions below the rank of vice president at the time.
     McMahon became CFO in October, after the ouster of Andrew Fastow, who set up and ran many of the private partnerships that led to Enron's demise. McMahon, a certified public accountant, joined Enron in 1994 from MG Natural Gas Corp., where he was CFO.
     Phone calls to Enron seeking comment from McMahon and Whalley weren't returned.

Seeking Control

     With most of Enron's more desirable assets sold or withering, creditors have stepped up efforts to control what's left of the company.
     In court papers filed yesterday, the creditors' committee asked a bankruptcy judge for permission to investigate Enron's former auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, to help it prepare possible legal action against the accounting firm.
     Enron fired Andersen last week after the firm admitted employees destroyed Enron-related documents.
     Lay's resignation comes amid a dozen government investigations and more than 50 civil lawsuits into Enron's collapse. The company filed bankruptcy Dec. 2 and fired more than 4,500 employees after it admitted overstating profit by $586 million since 1997.

UBS Moves To Start Up Former Enron US Energy Trade Ops
By Mark Golden and John Edmiston

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- UBS AG (UBS) unit UBS-Warburg took a step forward Thursday in its restart of the acquired North American energy trading unit of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ).
UBS Warburg management asked all Enron employees that had accepted employment offers or intended to do so to attend a hastily called orientation meeting in Houston at the posh Houstonian Hotel. About 700 employees attended thee meeting, where they were given basic information about UBS and dealt with routine employment matters, attendees outside the hotel said. 
The employees were told that they would hear more about UBS' vision for the trading unit next week. 
UBS declined to comment on the meeting. 
UBS has offered jobs to the vast majority of Enron's North American energy trading staff, and many of those workers have already signed employment contracts, Enron and UBS employees said. The unit is expected to start trading next month. 
""Our goal is to reestablish the business,"" UBS spokesman David Walker said. ""The buildup will be measured and focused on customer needs."" 
In a deal approved by the bankruptcy court last week, UBS will take ownership of Enron's North American energy trading operations. The transaction involves no cash, but Enron will collect a third of the unit's profits for 10 years. UBS can begin to buy out Enron's interest in Year 3 of the deal. 
Walker declined to comment on whether UBS expects its energy trading volume to approach Enron's former level, nor would he say what the size of the unit's capitalization will be. The company won't be afraid of taking some big risks, however. 
""The risk profile will be consistent with the risk profile of UBS Warburg,"" Walker said. 
Some traders for other companies have questioned whether the UBS/Enron group could be anywhere near as large as the old Enron. Without enormous capitalization, the unit won't be able to make huge directional calls on commodity prices or stand by those calls for awhile even when the market moves in the opposite direction, as Enron did. Without huge deal flow, some traders have said, UBS/Enron won't have the market information that helped Enron traders make the right directional calls most of the time. 
But employees of Enron and UBS disagreed Thursday. 
""They haven't given us specifics, and I'm sure it won't be like 'the Big E' - that was an extreme situation,"" one trader moving to UBS said. ""But they recognize the need for a certain amount of latitude in order to make money in this business. Will there be a severe change to risk limits? I don't think so."" 
A UBS employee agreed. 
""That's what we do for a living: We manage risk and sometimes make big bets, too,"" the employee said. ""Don't think that we don't have any tolerance for that."" 
UBS has no intention of buying any of Enron's current trading positions, which are in the process of being liquidated following Enron's bankruptcy filing Dec. 2. Nor does UBS have any intention of acquiring Enron's retail unit, Enron Energy Services, which worked closely with the wholesale traders. 
""We plan on building up our own portfolio,"" Walker said.

USA: Jesse Jackson to meet, pray with Enron's Lay.

01/24/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

HOUSTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Civil rights activist Rev. Jesse Jackson and former Enron Corp. chief executive Ken Lay were set to talk on Thursday night in a meeting at Enron headquarters that was likely to include a prayer session, a Jackson spokesman said. 
The hastily arranged session will be part of a two-day Jackson visit to Houston to drum up support for thousands of laid-off Enron employees who lost their savings in the energy trader's financial collapse, spokesman Mike Levine said.
""(Jackson) wanted to meet one-on-one with Lay just to let him know he's not here to come after him. He's just here to raise support for the employees,"" Levine said. 
""I'm sure they'll do some praying,"" he said. 
The besieged Lay, who is the son of a Baptist preacher, resigned in disgrace as Enron's chairman and chief executive officer on Wednesday, saying he could not reorganize the bankrupt company and fight its mounting legal battles at the same time. 
He remains on Enron's board of directors, but is scheduled to testify before Congress next month and faces numerous civil lawsuits and a criminal investigation by the U.S. Justice Department. 
Enron was the nation's top energy trading company until Dec. 2 when a ruinous financial scandal forced it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
Jackson's visit comes a day after fellow activist Al Sharpton appeared on the steps of Enron headquarters to urge federal help for Enron employees and investors. 
An Enron spokesman was not immediately available for comment.

The Collected Letters of Enron's Employees: Michael Lewis
2002-01-24 14:33 (New York)

     (Commentary. Michael Lewis, whose books include ``Next: The Future Just Happened'' and ``Liar's Poker,'' is a columnist for Bloomberg News. The opinions expressed are his own.)

     Berkeley, California, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- One of the high points of my day is reading the mail I receive from current and former Enron Corp. employees.
     If you are in the middle of a big media story and have some feel for its nuances, the coverage of that story always seems ridiculously inadequate. A lot of Enron's employees seem to feel the press doesn't fully understand what has happened to them.
     At any rate, a number of Old Enronians have felt compelled to call or write to me. Thanks to them I know that the now notorious Raptor partnership, into which Enron's top executives stuffed many bad investments, got its name because raptors ate garbage.
     Thanks to them I understand that the documents Arthur Andersen shredded were probably butt-covering memos from junior accountants to their bosses that spelled out the tacit understanding between the junior accountants and Enron that enabled Arthur Andersen to turn a blind eye to Enron's deceits.
     Thanks to them I know that Jeffrey Skilling was widely regarded as the shrewdest of the top executives and, by resigning for ``personal reasons,'' signaled to everyone else that Enron was doomed.
     But these letters from Enron's employees -- especially the ones from people still working at Enron -- are frustrating, because they usually come with a request that I avoid contacting them for further discussion. They don't want to be famous, just understood.

Unanswered Questions

     With no one on the inside to quiz, I still don't understand the story as it demands to be understood. Big questions remain about Enron, including:
     1) Why did Enron make so many really stupid investments?
     At the heart of the company's problems were a lot of inexplicable purchases of Indian power plants and Brazilian pipelines and so on. As one especially acute Enron correspondent put it, ``it really takes a ton of people to flush billions down the toilet. Popular wisdom would have us believe that it was just a few bad apples at the top (but) at the very least hundreds of employees knew about a couple of bad deals they worked on. Why weren't they wondering who was making all the money?''
     Enron's investment decisions were so colossally inept as to suggest an ulterior motive. But the best explanation I've received -- that Enron bought power plants in far-flung places to gain access to information about supply and demand in those markets that it could use in trading -- still rings hollow.

Fastow Mystery

     2) Why didn't Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, sell his Enron stock on the way down? Kenneth Lay and Skilling and other top executives clearly knew that they had to
get out while the getting was good and sold millions of dollars of Enron shares.
     Lay was more or less hand-selling his private holdings to his employees. But Fastow, who knew as much about the rot as anyone, held on when he must have known the stock was likely to collapse. Why? Even as he functioned as Enron's CFO was he grooming himself for the courtroom? Is that why he was so quick to hire crack trial lawyer David Boies?
     3) Why isn't it considered strange that Enron lent millions of dollars to its already rich chairman? Lay's lawyer has claimed that Lay sold some of his Enron stock simply to repay personal loans the company made to him. But why was the company lending him money in the first place?

This Is Morality?

     4) Why was Sherron Watkins, the author of the now famous letter to Lay, reprinted last week in the New York Times, regarded within Enron as a deeply moral person?
     Her letter has been waved about in the media as a weapon against Lay, as evidence that the boss ignored warnings from below, and that there was at least one good woman inside Enron who was deeply, deeply disturbed by the bad behavior.
     But Watkins' letter was not a work of moral philosophy. Her chief concern was not that Enron was breaking the law and cheating its investors, but that people outside Enron might find out that Enron was breaking the law and cheating investors -- and that, as she put it, ``my eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing on my resume.''
     5) Why do people continue to work for companies even after they've concluded the people who run them are dishonest?
     Watkins' letter quotes a fellow employee saying ``I know it would be devastating to all of us, but I wish we would get caught. We're such a crooked company.'' Many of Enron's employees now claim to have been equally cynical about their enterprise.
     None of the many I've heard from has risen to the defense of Lay, Skilling, Fastow, et al. But all of these people seem to believe that their cynicism absolves them from any personal responsibility. Many of them apparently see themselves as innocent victims. Were they?

Enron delinquent in state tax payments

01/24/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - California tax officials say the embattled Enron Corp. is more than a year late in paying a $493,000 tax bill. 
The bankrupt energy giant is facing investigations by congressional committees and the Securities and Exchange Commission. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer has subpoenaed the company regarding his investigation into last year's price spikes in the wholesale energy market.
And a California legislative committee investigating possible price manipulation has served additional subpoenas on Enron officials about possible destruction of documents. 
The California Franchise Tax Board said Enron's corporate tax payment was due March 15 of last year. 
The state will send a notice to Enron later this spring if it doesn't receive its money, said Pat Hill, a spokesman for the Franchise Tax Board, which collects individual and business taxes. 
""Whatever taxes you owe, you have to pay by the deadline, which in Enron's case was March 15. The return isn't due until October,"" Hill said. He didn't know if the company had filed a return by the deadline. 
Enron's bill is accruing 7 percent interest while it goes unpaid, he said. 
The state may have to file a claim in the company's bankruptcy hearing to get paid. 
""We'll be in the same line as all those families of employees the company owes,"" said Steve Maviglio, spokesman for the governor. 
The taxes are owed for earnings in California in 2000. Corporate taxes are typically not public information, but the tax board does release the amount of money companies owe when they are delinquent. 
Every year, about 600,000 California residents and 22,000 corporations get a letter from the tax board because they haven't paid, Hill said. The board usually gives companies as long as 15 months after the due date before it sends the letter. 
If companies refuse to pay taxes, the board can revoke their corporation status, effectively ending their ability to do business in the state. 
""Enron has other more pressing issues, I think,"" Hill said. 
Enron's bill is a small fraction of the state's annual tax collection, about $40 billion.

Andersen employees paid overtime to shred Enron documents - internal memo

01/24/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - Employees working for Andersen LLP were paid overtime to shred documents related to Enron Corp, according to an internal Andersen memo released by the House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. 
""We do expect that people will be able to do this on an overtime basis, if necessary, for the remainder of this week, or for however long it takes for each of you to be comfortable"" that the document retention and destruction guidelines are being met, the Oct 24 e-mail message said.
On Nov 10, a new policy instructing Andersen employees to stop shredding documents was implemented, but the prior policy allowed for destruction of certain documents. 
The memo was released following a hearing where Andersen executives were questioned by committee members about the company's role in the growing Enron scandal.

USA: Judge grants early Andersen depositions in Enron suit.
By C. Bryson Hull

01/24/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

HOUSTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday ordered six key Andersen employees to give early depositions about the shredding of Enron-related documents, handing an initial victory to shareholders suing the auditor and the failed energy giant's top insiders. 
U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon granted in full a motion for discovery in the massive suit that requires the preservation of all Enron-related records held by Andersen, the accounting firm that Enron Corp. fired last week. The motion was requested by all but one plaintiff in the suit.
Allegations of systematic document shredding at Andersen and Enron rapidly mobilized plaintiffs' attorneys, who pushed for the early discovery and depositions to preserve as much evidence as possible in what is certain to be a lengthy lawsuit with billions of dollars at stake. 
The six employees include Andersen's fired top partner on the Enron account, David Duncan, who on Thursday asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during a hearing before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. 
Andersen fired him on Jan. 15 for ordering the destruction of Enron documents after a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe was launched in October. 
Also giving depositions will be four other Andersen partners in Houston who were relieved of their management responsibilities and a lawyer who sent an e-mail explaining Andersen's document-destruction policy to the auditor's Houston office. 
Harmon's order waives a provision of U.S. securities law that delays depositions until a judge determines whether a suit is frivolous. The provision is intended to prevent legal interviews from being improperly used to gather business information. 
The depositions cannot be taken until 20 days from now, and are restricted to eight hours and limited to the topic of document and data destruction or storage. 
The order allows Andersen's outside lawyers to guard the documents at their own sites and permits the plaintiffs to inspect those sites immediately. Andersen must within 20 days categorize and report the documents they have found or recovered, and explain the steps it took to recover deleted documents, the order says. 
One lawyer said the plaintiffs were delighted with the judge's ruling. 
Andersen, joined by lawyers who are suing them on behalf of the New York City and state of Florida pension funds, had opposed only the early depositions. 
""We had asked for 95 percent of this, and even had suggested a lot of it,"" Andersen attorney Rusty Hardin said. ""We'll make those people available. We just thought it would be more convenient for them to give the depositions a few months from now, when they were more familiar with the documents."" 
Hardin said he only had control over the appearances of the five current Andersen employees, who all have their own attorneys. 
Since Duncan has been fired, his own attorney will handle the depositions, Hardin said. A Duncan representative had no immediate comment, having just learned of the order.

Arthur Andersen Ordered to Protect Enron Documents
2002-01-24 13:21 (New York)

     Houston, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Arthur Andersen LLP officials must answer questions about what Enron Corp. auditing records have been destroyed and protect remaining documents, a federal judge ruled.
     U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon gave Andersen officials 20 days to investigate the destruction of Enron documents and report to the court how many can be reconstructed.
     Enron Corp. shareholders sought the order after officials of Andersen acknowledged earlier this month that they shredded or deleted ``a significant number'' of Enron documents. The Justice Department, Securities and Exchange Commission, congressional committees and shareholders' lawyers want the documents to help determine how Enron collapsed.
      ``I expect we'll learn through this questioning that the document destruction was a deliberate, calculated effort to protect Andersen from liability,'' said William Lerach, a San Diego-based lawyer representing Enron investors in lawsuits over the energy trader's collapse.
``We've got full protection for the documents now.''
     Officials of Chicago-based Andersen weren't immediately available for comment on the ruling. Shares of Houston-based Enron, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December, rose 4 cents to 38 cents in mid afternoon trading.
     Lawyers for Enron investors, bondholders and former employees began pushing for a court order to safeguard Enron-related records after reports surfaced that document-shredding continued following internal orders to halt it.
     A fired Enron project manager said in court filings that documents were being destroyed at Enron's Houston headquarters as late as Jan. 14. Company officials sent out e-mails in November ordering workers to set aside any records that may be involved in Enron-related probes.
     Earlier this week, Enron officials said they found a trash can full of shredded documents on the 19th floor of the company's downtown Houston skyscraper. That led investors' lawyers to allege record destruction was continuing.

Questioning Slated

     Under Harmon's four-page order, Andersen officials must set aside documents, letters, e-mails and other records related to Enron audits. They also must try to reconstruct any destroyed documents or recreate deleted electronic files from backup tapes.
     Andersen also must make a group of employees available to be questioned by shareholders' lawyers on what documents were destroyed, when they were destroyed and who ordered their
destruction, under Harmon's order.
     The Andersen employees to be questioned include Thomas H. Bauer, Michael M. Lowther, Michael C. Odom and Stephen Goddard Jr., all partners in Andersen's Houston office.
      Goddard, the office's former managing partner, has been placed on administrative leave along with Bauer, Lowther and Odom following the shredding disclosures, according to Harmon's order.
     Nancy Temple, an Andersen in-house lawyer in Chicago, also has been ordered to submit to questioning by shareholders' lawyers. Temple answered questions about Enron's collapse and the document destruction on Capitol Hill today.
     David B. Duncan, the fired former lead partner in charge of Andersen's Enron group, also must submit to questions by plaintiffs' lawyers about the document destruction, Harmon ruled.

Fifth Amendment

     Andersen lawyers told the judge yesterday that they can't force Duncan to show up for the questioning because he's no longer an employee.
     Duncan, who invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid a congressional committee's questions today, is likely to do the same thing at any deposition in the shareholder suits, said Rusty Hardin, a Houston lawyer representing the U.S.'s fifth-largest accounting firm.
     Investors' lawyers also can inspect the four secure sites that Andersen's lawyers are using to store documents and computers containing Enron-related material, the judge said.
     Finally, she ordered the accounting firm to hand out a copy of the order to all its partners.
     Hardin said plaintiffs' lawyers unfairly fanned public outrage about the shredding.
     ``There needs to be some modicum of decency in the way this company is treated,'' Hardin said.

Andersen Workers Told to Work Overtime on Shredding, Rep. Says
2002-01-24 15:00 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Arthur Andersen LLP employees were ordered to work overtime to destroy documents related to Enron Corp., U.S. Representative James Greenwood said, citing an Andersen memo.
     Greenwood, a Pennsylvania Republican, made the comments at an impromptu press conference after congressional hearings into the Enron case.
     A federal judge ruled today that Andersen officials must answer questions about what Enron auditing records have been destroyed and must protect remaining documents.

Wide Effort Seen in Shredding Data on Enron's Audits
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.
January 24, 2002
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24 - Scores of people who worked at Arthur Andersen's Houston office were involved in the destruction of documents related to the Enron Corporation according to the chairman of one of the Congressional subcommittees that began hearings today on Enron's collapse. 
The chairman, Representative James C. Greenwood, Republican of Pennsylvania, head of the House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee, said investigators for the subcommittee had determined that document shredding was widespread and that up to 80 people had received orders to destroy papers. He said it called into question Andersen's attempts to blame rogue employees for the episode.
The hearings today are Congress's first public exploration into the Enron collapse, the largest corporate Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in American history. 
Enron's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, announced his resignation late Wednesday, saying the many investigations into the company's collapse would require too much of his attention.
Last week, Andersen, one of the Big Five accounting firms, fired the lead partner on the Enron account, David B. Duncan, saying he orchestrated widespread document destruction shortly after learning of a government investigation into Enron's finances.
But Mr. Greenwood expressed skepticism on Wednesday about that account. ""Do you believe that 80 Andersen employees were directed by Mr. Duncan to violate an express provision of policy by Andersen in the face of yet another investigation, and none of them picked up the phone and called their superiors and said, `This doesn't seem right'?"" he asked. ""The question we need to get to is, Were there instructions from above.""
Other people close to the investigation said they doubted that the number of Andersen employees was as high as Mr. Greenwood's estimate, but they said it was a much larger group than the company had suggested. Mr. Duncan appeared today under subpoena at the energy and commerce subcommittee hearing, but as expected, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. His lawyer, Robert Giuffra, told the committee in a letter on Wednesday, that Mr. Duncan would ""rely on his Constitutional right not to testify"" unless he is given immunity.
Congressional investigators made public on Wednesday a memo Mr. Duncan wrote last October saying he expressed concerns about the way in which Enron was about to disclose huge losses from controversial dealings that investigators believed played a significant role in the company's collapse. The disclosure, he said, was misleading to investors and possibly illegal.
On Oct. 16, Enron disclosed that it lost $618 million during the third quarter and that it would have to reduce its net worth by $1.2 billion, partly because of dealings with investment partnerships that had been headed by Andrew S. Fastow, who was then the company's chief financial officer. At the time, the company said the losses were the result of one-time losses, leaving the impression that the company could weather the bad quarterly results.
But two days earlier, Mr. Duncan warned the company's chief accounting officer, Rick Causey, that the way the company planned to disclose the information might be ""misconstrued or misunderstood by investors,"" according to a memo Mr. Duncan wrote to his files on Oct. 15 that was made available to Congressional investigators. However, the press release Enron issued the next day was ""essentially the original presentation,"" Mr. Duncan wrote.
Mr. Duncan said in his memo that he had warned Mr. Causey that the Securities and Exchange Commission initiates enforcement actions against companies that issue financial information that is ""materially misleading."" He said the company should rewrite its earnings report and bring in lawyers to assure that its statements were not false.
One week later, officials in Andersen's Houston office began to shred Enron-related documents on a massive scale, even though Enron had just disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun an investigation into its finances. Andersen fired Mr. Duncan last week, saying he had ordered the destruction of the Enron papers.
An Andersen spokesman, Charlie Leonard, characterized Mr. Duncan's memo as routine and said it reflected internal debates about accounting issues that occur between auditors and corporate executives. He added: ""It looks like that with the exception of some inappropriate phrasing, Mr. Duncan was doing what he was supposed to.""
An Andersen official on Wednesday evening repeated the firm's assertion that Mr. Duncan's actions, aided by other partners in the Houston office who were demoted or placed on leave last week, had not been sanctioned. 
""The one glaring fact here is that David Duncan, with full knowledge of an S.E.C. investigation, initiated a massive document destruction campaign,"" official said.
The hearings that began today, which will eventually involve 10 different committees, could lead to changes in pension, tax, securities and accounting laws, though many experts are skeptical how far lawmakers will go. Past efforts to tighten laws in these areas, particularly auditing standards, have been beaten back by industry lobbying.
The fall of Enron has touched off a scramble in the capital to assign blame and avoid the taint of the company's prodigious political donations.
Some Democrats in Congress see the Enron case as a windfall that could dent President Bush's lofty public approval ratings. But many Democrats are also vulnerable because the company spread its largess so widely and the accounting and regulatory practices that led to Enron's collapse took place under Democratic and Republican administrations.
In the House, the Energy and Commerce subcommittee cross-examined senior Arthur Andersen officials about why the firm destroyed Enron documents after learning about an S.E.C. investigation into the company's finances.
Also, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee was examining whether government policies failed and what new legislation is needed. The first witness was Arthur Levitt, the former S.E.C. chairman whose efforts to tighten auditing standards two years ago were derailed by opposition from Congress. 
Separately, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, formally asked the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to investigate Enron, arguing the case ""represents one of the largest corporate frauds in the nation's history"" and citing the large campaign donations Enron has provided to President Bush over the years and the large number of senior administration officials who worked for or invested in the company.
A Justice Department official said that he had not seen Mr. Conyers's letter and that officials were still proceeding with their criminal investigation.
The Senate Finance Committee asked Enron on Wednesday to turn over tax returns for the past 16 years, in a letter sent by the committee chairman, Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and the ranking Republican, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa. Their request follows the disclosure in The New York Times last week that Enron used almost 900 subsidiaries in tax-haven countries and other techniques to pay no income taxes in four of the last five years.
In an interview, Mr. Greenwood said Mr. Duncan had sought immunity for his testimony but had been rebuffed. Justice Department officials are worried that grants of immunity made by Congress might hamper their criminal investigation of Enron and Andersen.
Investigators had asked Andersen's chief executive, Joseph F. Berardino, to appear, but Mr. Berardino said he would be willing to attend on a later date. Instead, Dorsey Baskin, a senior technical expert at Andersen, testified, as did Nancy Temple, an in-house lawyer for Andersen in Chicago.
While the House subcommittee hearing is focusing on Andersen's document destruction, attention will turn later to the reasons for Enron's flawed accounting. In Mr. Duncan's memo, the auditor says Andersen had expressed serious reservations about Enron's accounting, particularly the company's description of large losses as ""nonrecurring,"" or one-time, charges.
Andersen had advised Enron that its use of the term ""could potentially be misunderstood by investors,"" Mr. Duncan's memo states. ""We pointed out that such items are, more often than not, included in normal operating earnings in"" financial statements that are put together using generally accepted accounting practices.
The next day - the same day Enron disclosed the earnings press release that Mr. Duncan objected to - Ms. Temple, who had been involved in discussing the matter with Mr. Duncan, sent an e-mail message to Mr. Duncan and others at the firm suggesting that language be deleted from the memo ""that might suggest we have concluded the release is misleading.""
A copy of the message showed that Ms. Temple appeared to be worried about potential litigation on Enron's finances and she sought to remove her name from the list of people who received the document: ""If my name is mentioned it increases the chances that I might be a witness, which I prefer to avoid.""
Ms. Temple's lawyer did not return a telephone call for comment. Mr. Leonard, the Andersen spokesman, said Ms. Temple was simply worried about waiving attorney-client privilege. Her reference to not concluding that the press release is misleading reflects her understanding that auditors ""don't have a right or responsibility to pass judgment on press releases,"" only formal financial statements, he added.
Mr. Duncan, 42, has told investigators that he was only destroying documents in keeping with an Oct. 12 e-mail message from Ms. Temple that emphasized that they follow a policy requiring some documents be destroyed. Mr. Duncan has told investigators he stopped shredding after Ms. Temple ordered it halted Nov. 9.
While Andersen officials have sought to blame Mr. Duncan and other employees in Houston office for the destruction of the documents, investigators are skeptical and want to probe why the firm waited more than two weeks after Enron disclosed the S.E.C. investigation to order the shredding stopped.
Mr. Greenwood said that in interviews with committee investigators, Mr. Duncan stated that on at least two occasions before Oct. 12, Ms. Temple asked him, ""How are you on compliance with the document-retention on Enron?"" 
""Did she really mean that,"" Mr. Greenwood asked, ""or did she mean, `How are you doing on getting rid of the documents?""'

Enron's chief auditor refuses to testify
Lawmakers describe widespread destruction of Enron documents at Andersen
January 24, 2002 Posted: 1:17 PM EST (1817 GMT)
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The former Andersen LLP auditor who handled Enron's books refused to testify at Thursday's opening hearing of a congressional panel investigating the shredding of documents related to the Enron collapse. 
Top auditor David Duncan, since fired by Anderson -- which did Enron's accounts -- invoked his Fifth Amendment rights against self incrimination and declined to speak further. 
Lawmakers on the investigative subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee described on Thursday what they called widespread and systematic effort to shred Enron-related documents at the company's accounting firm and charged that the practice, which was later suspended, has impeded investigations and could lead to criminal charges. 
Duncan, who was the first to be called to testify, had earlier said through his lawyer that he would refuse to testify before the congressional panel unless he was granted immunity. Lawmakers left open the possibility that he will return before the committee at a later date. 
""Mr. Duncan, Enron robbed a bank. Arthur Andersen provided the getaway car and they say you were at the wheel,"" Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pennsylvania, the subcommittee chairman, told Duncan shortly after he was sworn in to testify. 
But when Greenwood asked whether he ordered the destruction of Enron documents in an attempt to subvert investigators, Duncan declined to answer. 
""Mr. Chairman, I would like to answer the committee's questions but on the advice of my counsel I respectfully decline to answer the question based on the protection afforded to me under the Constitution of the United States,"" Duncan said, repeating it when asked to clarify. 
Greenwood dismissed him from the hearing room, but said Duncan might return to testify at a later date. 
Other Andersen executives were also scheduled to testify at the hearing on Enron, the energy giant that filed the biggest bankruptcy case in U.S. history 
Panel members were highly critical of Andersen executives. 
""It is clear that scores of professionals and support staff were involved in the shredding of paper and deletion of computer files relating to the Enron audit. Yet to date, committee investigators have been unable to locate or learn about a single Andersen employee who raised any concerns or objections about destroying Enron-related documents even after the [Securities and Exchange Commission] inquiry became public,"" Greenwood said. 
Rep. John Dingell, D-Michigan, the ranking member on the panel, said the accounting firm's shredding of documents ""was either criminally stupid or stupidly criminal, or both."" 
Lawmakers vowed to get to the bottom of Enron's bankruptcy. 
""Let me make it clear, this committee will cut no one any slack as we go forward,"" said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-Louisiana, the chairman of the full Energy and Commerce Committee. ""If there has been corporate wrongdoing, we'll unroot it. If there's personal or corporate attempts to hide the facts, we'll uncover them and people will answer for them."" 
Tauzin said before the hearing that it is likely criminal charges will be filed because of indications that both Enron and Anderson shredded financial documents after Enron filed for bankruptcy and as it faced numerous investigations and lawsuits. 
""I would not be surprised if some criminal indictments come out of this,"" Tauzin told CNN in an interview before the hearing started. 
One congressional aide said the shredding at Andersen was more widespread than the company has acknowledged, involving as many as 80 employees. 
The hearing came a day after Kenneth Lay resigned from his role as chairman and chief executive of the collapsed energy giant. 
""I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen, we need someone at the helm who can focus 100 percent of his efforts on reorganizing the company and preserving value for our creditors and hard-working employees,"" Lay said in a written statement. 
""Unfortunately, with the multiple inquiries and investigations that currently require much of my time, it is becoming increasingly difficult to concentrate fully on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders."" 
Lay will remain on Enron's board, but he will step down as the company's leadership post, the company announced. The move came after talks with the creditor's committee at Enron, Lay said. 
Enron filed for bankruptcy in December. Before its sudden collapse, it was ranked the seventh-largest U.S. company in terms of revenue. 
In October, Enron was forced to disclose that it had concealed more than $500 million in debt from related partnerships led by company executives. Its stock, which once traded at nearly $90 a share, sank to less than $1 a share. 
The company's collapse has sparked a Justice Department probe and numerous congressional investigations. The company and its executives have been the single biggest group of contributors to President Bush and other Republican campaigns, and they have donated to many Democratic lawmakers as well. 
Enron's executives and directors sold about $1.3 billion worth of stock in the last three years, with Lay making $119 million, according to a Thomson Financial study that CNN commissioned. One particularly controversial aspect of the company's collapse is that employees were barred from selling stock held in their 401 (k) plans even as executives were unloading their plummeting shares. The prohibition decimated the retirement accounts of many employees. 
The Andersen accounting firm admitted its employees shredded documents relating to Enron audits in the days after the company's problems became public. 
Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino conceded Sunday that his company made errors but said that Enron's demise ultimately was the result of a failed business model, not shady accounting. 
A former Enron executive said Monday that employees at the company's headquarters in Houston, Texas, were shredding documents as late as January 14 in spite of the company's bankruptcy filing that costs thousands of investors and employees their life savings. Security guards were posted in the building Wednesday to prevent further shredding.

The discussion Thursday between fired Enron auditor David Duncan and Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., chairman of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee investigating the Enron collapse: 
GREENWOOD: Good morning, Mr. Duncan.
Mr. Duncan is here with us today under subpoena. To date, Mr. Duncan has cooperated with this committee in our search for the facts by submitting to an interview last week with our committee investigator that lasted more than four hours. 
Yet we received a letter from his counsel yesterday stating that Mr. Duncan authorized his counsel to advise the committee that he will, quote, rely on his constitutional right not to testify, close quote. 
I believe that this privilege should be personally exercised by, before the members, and that's why we have requested Mr. Duncan's appearance here today and request that he reconsider. 
Mr. Duncan, you're aware that the committee is holding an investigative hearing and that in doing so we have the practice of taking testimony under oath. Do you have objection to testifying under oath? 
DUNCAN: No sir. 
GREENWOOD: Thank you. The chair also advises you that under the rules of the House and the rules of the committee, you are entitled to be advised by counsel. Do you desire to be advised by counsel during your testimony today? 
DUNCAN: Yes sir. 
GREENWOOD: In that case, would you please rise and raise your right hand, and I will swear you in. Mr. Duncan, do you swear that you will tell, the testimony you will give this committee is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? 
DUNCAN: Yes, Mr. Chairman. 
GREENWOOD: Thank you, Mr. Duncan. You are now under oath and you may give a 5-minute summary of your written testimony if you choose to. 
DUNCAN: I have no summary, sir. 
GREENWOOD: OK. The chair will recognize himself for questioning. Mr. Duncan, Enron robbed the bank. Arthur Anderson provided the getaway car, and they say you were at the wheel. 
I have a specific question for you, Mr. Duncan. You were fired by Anderson last week for orchestrating an expedited effort among the Anderson-Enron engagement team to destroy thousands of paper documents and electronic files relating to the Enron matter after learning of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission into Enron's complex financial transactions. Did you give an order to destroy documents in an attempt to subvert governmental investigations into Enron's financial collapse, and if so, did you do so at the direction or suggestion of anyone at Anderson or at Enron? 
DUNCAN: Mr. Chairman, I would like to answer the committee's questions, but on the advice of my counsel I respectfully decline to answer the question based on the protection afforded me under the Constitution of the United States. 
GREENWOOD: Let me be clear, Mr. Duncan. Are you refusing to answer the question on the basis of the protections afforded to you under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution? 
DUNCAN: Again, on the advice of my counsel, respectfully I respectfully decline to answer the question based on the protection afforded me under the United States Constitution. 
GREENWOOD: Will you invoke your Fifth Amendment rights in response to all of our questions here today? 
DUNCAN: Respectfully that will be my response to all of your questions. 
GREENWOOD: I am disappointed to hear that, but it is therefore the chair's intention to dismiss the witness. Mr. Duncan, we thank you for your attendance today and your respect for this committee's process. You are dismissed.

USA: Lawyers see settlement of massive Andersen suits.
By Gail Appleson, Law Correspondent

01/24/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Andersen, which handled Enron Corp.'s audits, will have to pay what could be hundreds of millions of dollars to settle massive civil litigation if it hopes to survive the scandal over the energy trader's collapse, legal experts say. 
""This is one that will never get to trial,"" said Robert McTamaney, partner at the New York law firm of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn.
Some experts said Andersen will have to move quickly to reach a deal that will limit civil liabilities and restore confidence in the firm. But they said it will take an enormous sum to do so, raising questions as to just how much Andersen and its insurers can handle. 
While the insurance amount is confidential, insurance sources have told Reuters they think Andersen has a maximum of $500 million in professional liability coverage in the commercial market plus funds held in several self-owned Bermuda insurance entities. 
Even if Andersen can withstand a huge settlement and other costs growing out of potential legal woes, lawyers said it faces an even tougher issue. 
""It's not a question of money, but of the credibility of the firm,"" said Stephen Younger, a partner at New York's Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler, adding that Andersen's future will be affected by the departures of clients and its own employees. 
Dozens of class-action suits filed by Enron employee benefit plans and outside investors who bought artificially inflated Enron stock are piling up against Andersen mostly in Houston federal court. 
The Chicago-based Andersen has come under fire for approving accounting practices that enabled Enron to use hundreds of partnerships to hide debt or generate questionable profits. 
RACKETEERING LAWS 
As recently as Wednesday a suit was filed by Enron employees alleging Andersen and Enron officials broke federal racketeering laws. The suit alleges the defendants conspired to hide Enron's true financial condition by withholding critical information, causing employees to lose more than $1.3 billion from their retirement funds. 
Lawyers expect the cases will be certified as class actions and consolidated in one court. 
The accounting firm's exposure has grown significantly because Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing has stayed all litigation against the fallen energy company. 
""Clearly Arthur Andersen is a nice deep pocket,"" said Marc Galanter, University of Wisconsin law professor, who pointed out that class-action suits rarely go to trial. 
Defendants in class-action litigation often choose to settle cases for a lump sum even if they feel they have done nothing wrong. Such pacts can end the uncertainty over the length and cost of litigation. Therefore, settlements are often seen as less risky and cheaper than fighting individual cases particularly if there are many plaintiffs. 
Although plaintiffs can opt out of a settlement, the majority of them usually participate. 
As the civil cases over Enron's accounting measures are multiplying, Congress, the Justice Department, and state and federal regulators are investigating whether Andersen acted improperly. 
On Thursday, for example, a House subcommittee held a hearing on Andersen's shredding of documents relating to Enron. 
While it is unclear whether these probes will result in charges or other actions against Andersen, the pending civil cases are an existing threat. 
SIX MONTHS? THREE YEARS? 
""The million dollar question is when will they be settled,"" said Younger. 
Expert's predictions ranged from six months to three years. Some doubted that a judge or jury would ever even have the chance to decide the key allegations of the suits. 
""The train wreck has already happened and this is not about whether the conductor did or didn't switch tracks,"" said David White, a principal of Washington D.C.-based Mission Strategies, a public affairs consulting firm that specializes in crisis communication and litigation matters. 
""Now it's a matter of picking up the pieces,"" he said, adding that he thought the settlement would be reached in a matter of months, not years. 
Younger said he would expect it would take at least six months for the different parties to begin building their cases. He said other matters will probably affect the timing including how long it takes to determine the size of the class and whether civil litigation will be stayed by proceedings in Enron's bankruptcy or by possible criminal cases. 
However, he thought Andersen's management would act ""sooner rather than later because if they don't, the firm won't survive."" 
McTamaney thought it would take two to three years to settle the civil cases, but that Andersen would remain a viable company. 
""I think it's highly unlikely that Arthur Andersen will end up in bankruptcy,"" he said, adding that he felt the firm's accountants are excellent professionals. 
""I think the claims against them reflect the difficulties inherent in auditing a massively complex financial enterprise which itself seemed determined to possibly misdirect financial attention to arguably more attractive aspects of its business and away from the problem areas,"" he said.

State Board Confirms Investigation into Arthur Andersen LLP/Enron Audit

01/24/2002
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire)

AUSTIN, Texas, Jan. 24 /PRNewswire/ -- Attorneys for Arthur Andersen LLP have given the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy permission to disclose that in November 2001 the Board opened an official investigation into Andersen's audit of Enron. 
The Texas Board is prohibited by law from disclosing any specific details of this matter. The Public Accountancy Act, the Board's enabling statute, expressly states that information gathered or received regarding a disciplinary action against a license holder is confidential and not subject to public disclosure until: 
* the Board receives the respondent's written permission to disclose 
that an investigation is underway; 
* the Board has issued a final order in a disciplinary action resulting 
from an informal proceeding; or 
* the Board has held a formal public hearing in the matter.
The Texas Board is statutorily mandated to protect the public by ensuring that persons issued CPA certificates possess the necessary education, skills, and capabilities and that they perform competently when serving the public. 
Each state board of public accountancy issues its own CPA certificate and license, and therefore is the only entity that can carry out disciplinary actions involving the forfeiture of a certificate or license. Individual state boards of accountancy regulate not only CPAs who provide services to SEC registrants, but also those who work with smaller companies. 
The Texas Board's efforts include ensuring that appropriate action is taken and that due process is carried out in all enforcement cases. The staff annually investigates and prosecutes approximately 300 alleged violations of the rules of professional conduct and the statute. 
The Texas Board's disciplinary process begins with a complaint, filed either by a member of the public, another government entity, or on the Board's own initiative. A staff investigation follows, sometimes with the assistance of an outside technical consultant. 
The Texas Board designates certain investigations as ""major cases."" These involve CPA firms implicated in the audits of failed or troubled savings and loan organizations, financial institutions, insurance companies, and other cases of a major nature. Such cases are more complex and require substantial resources for pre-hearing preparations and prosecution. The Texas Board engages the Texas Attorney General's office to assist in the prosecutorial process. 
""I am proud of the Board's long record of vigorously investigating all complaints against CPAs,"" said K. Michael Conway, CPA from Midland and the Texas Board's presiding officer. ""The Board administers a wide range of sanctions against individual CPAs and/or CPA firms that are found to have violated the Public Accountancy Act or Board rules. The publishing of sanctions against CPAs and/or CPA firms is an integral part of protecting the public.""

This newsletter is distributed to all Texas CPAs and contains summaries of the Board's recent sanctions.

Fed's Greenspan Comments on `Egregious' Accounting at Enron
2002-01-24 12:40 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on accounting practices at Enron Corp. Greenspan's remarks came during the question-and-answer part of testimony to the Senate Budget Committee.
     ``I think that the extraordinary response to Enron is something I think is very helpful and indeed an indication that the people in this society have required that we maintain a very high standard of trustworthiness in our business operations,'' Greenspan said.
     ``If everybody did what is alleged in the Enron accounting system, our system could not work,'' he said. ``That is, if you have a system, a market system, it works off information. If you don't have a way to evaluate a particular asset you cannot price it and if you cannot price it you cannot get the appropriate allocation of capital in a market society.''
     As to Enron's accounting practices, Greenspan said: ``I think that was an egregious act. I tried as hard as I could to find an economic reason why those affiliates were constructed the way they were. The simplest explanation was the obvious explanation: that they did not want to indicate what their true earnings position was.''
     Greenspan said he would be concerned about Enron's practices harming the economy ``if there wasn't a reaction to it.''
     ``But the reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking by a lot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to the information coming out of business into the investment community,'' he said.
     While ``there's been an element of that'' in the past, ``I think there's going to be a good deal less of that. The old issue of competing for reputation is going to re-emerge. And I think you're going to find at some point that there are going to be people out there who are going to say `our accounts you can rely on' and that probably will increase their price-earnings ratios.''

Greenspan Says Enron 'Abrogated' Good Will Of US Public

01/24/2002
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Thursday joined President George W. Bush in denouncing the business conduct of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), accusing the company of abrogating the ""good will"" that it enjoyed from the public and its own employees. 
Testifying before the Senate Budget Committee, Greenspan said the public outrage over Enron's conduct before its collapse was justified. ""I think it is a very good sign,"" he said. ""I think it tells us that because the whole structure of American business is so fundamentally based on trust, any abrogation of that trust creates a real furor, which it should.
""There are other places in the world in which an episode like this would be shrugged off as normal business,"" Greenspan said. ""This is not the case here. It essentially tells us that we are not an economy that takes an erosion of reputation as a minor question."" 
Enron is the largest U.S. corporation in history to seek bankruptcy-court protection. It announced last November that it had overstated its earnings by $586 million in the past four years. Its stock lost nearly all its value, depleting the 401(k) retirement accounts of thousands of Enron employees and retirees. 
Bush said this week he was ""outraged"" that Enron had misled its employees and investors, and said the government should require corporations to disclose more financial information. Greenspan, for his part, said Enron's behavior has been properly condemned. 
""An abrogation of that good will, that clearly has happened - has been taken very seriously by the American public,"" he said.

USA: Derivatives at root of Enron collapse, expert says.
By Andrew Clark

01/24/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s extensive use of derivatives, not just its accounting practices, lie at the root of the fallen energy giant's slide into the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, an expert in the complex financial instruments told Congress on Thursday. 
University of San Diego law professor Frank Partnoy said Enron had used profits from its derivatives trading operation - the full scale of which was little appreciated by investors - to mask losses in its more visible businesses even as some of its employees were fraudulently manipulating those profits.
""It will surprise many investors to learn that Enron was, at its core, a derivatives trading firm,"" he said in testimony delivered at a Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing. 
A former Wall Street derivatives trader and white-collar crime specialist, Partnoy has been researching Enron's business practices for a book he is writing about its collapse. Enron officials had no immediate comment on his allegations. 
""It made billions trading derivatives, but it lost billions on virtually everything else it did, including projects in fiber-optic bandwidth, retail gas and power, water systems and even technology stocks,"" he said. ""Enron used its expertise in derivatives to hide these losses."" 
Derivatives are complex financial contracts whose values are linked to underlying variables such as the prices of commodities, stocks or bonds. They are typically used by sophisticated investors to manage risk. 
Partnoy said Enron's use of derivatives both outside and inside the company could be directly linked to its collapse. 
On the outside, he said, they were used to create the company's web of off-balance sheet deals with complex financial partnerships known as special-purpose vehicles. After some of those deals went sour, Enron in October took a $1 billion charge against earnings and a $1.2 billion write-down in shareholder equity, triggering its nosedive into bankruptcy. 
""Specifically, Enron used derivatives and special purpose vehicles in three ways,"" Partnoy said. 
""First, it hid speculator losses it suffered on technology stocks,"" he said. ""Second, it hid huge debts incurred to finance unprofitable new businesses, including retail energy service. Third, it inflated the value of other troubled businesses, including new ventures in fiber-optic bandwidth."" 
MANIPULATION ALLEGED 
But Enron's derivatives problems ran far deeper than the outside special purpose vehicles, Partnoy said, adding he had also gathered information indicating widespread manipulation of the company's derivatives trading revenues. 
""In a nutshell, it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit and loss entries for the derivatives Enron traded,"" he said. ""Simply put, Enron's reported earnings from derivatives seem to be more imagined than real."" 
Enron reported more than $16 billion in gains from derivatives over the three years to 2000, Partnoy said. He said the alleged false entries ""were systematic and occurred over several years, beginning as early as 1997."" 
Partnoy said some Enron traders had misused so-called ""prudency reserves,"" meant to reflect the inherent uncertainty about future profits from derivatives deals, as rainy-day funds to smooth out their profits and losses over time. 
Some had also apparently deliberately misvalued the forward rate curves used to determine the current value of their derivatives portfolios in order to hide losses, he said. 
""I cannot offer fact testimony as to any of these matters,"" Partnoy told the committee. ""Nonetheless, I strongly believe the information I have gathered is credible. It is from many sources, including written information, e-mail correspondence and telephone interviews."" 
At least eight congressional committees, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, are probing Enron's fall from grace and Partnoy said the episode should raise major questions about the regulation of derivatives as well as capital markets in general. 
""The collapse of Enron makes it plain that the key gatekeeper institutions that support our system of market capitalism have failed,"" he said. ""The institutions sharing the blame include auditors, law firms, banks, securities analysts, independent directors and credit rating agencies.""

Campaign Finance Bill to Get a Vote, Thanks to Enron
2002-01-24 14:24 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Advocates of a campaign finance overhaul have obtained the 218 signatures they need to bring their legislation to a vote in the U.S. House, over the
objection of Republican leaders who oppose it.
     The bill's backers said multiple investigations into Enron Corp., which gave almost $6 million to federal candidates since 1989, helped win support from a majority of the 435 lawmakers.
     ``It's a classic reminder of how money buys access and undermines confidence in our democracy,'' said Representative Martin Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat. ``If anything positive comes out of the Enron scandal, it will be passage of campaign finance reform.''
     The drive to gain signatures on a ``discharge petition'' to enable the debate began last year, after the Senate passed a bill to ban the unlimited and largely unregulated campaign donations known as ``soft money'' and the bill stalled in the House.
     The last four signatures were obtained today, as Enron's December bankruptcy was debated in committees all over Capitol Hill, according to the House Clerk's Office. Representatives
Corrine Brown of Florida, Richard Neal of Massachusetts, Thomas Petri of Wisconsin and Charles Bass of New Hampshire all signed. The first two are Democrats, the last two are Republicans.
     Bass and Petri said they signed after discussing the matter with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, an opponent of the bill.
     ``Unfortunately, we were unable to reach agreement,'' Bass said. ``Today I helped provide the necessary signatures to force a vote.''

Not Scheduled Yet

     Hastert told reporters this week that he anticipated the success of the petition drive. ``We're going to have a leadership discussion on it this weekend,'' he said.
     Representative Christopher Shays, the Republican sponsor from Connecticut, said he expects Hastert to schedule the legislation for floor debate without posing obstacles.
     The petition brings a campaign finance overhaul one step closer to passage, which would change the way U.S. elections are financed. Soft money is one of the few ways that corporations and labor unions can contribute in large amounts.
     Almost $452 million in soft money was given in the last election, including about $30 million from unions and more than $232 million from companies and their trade associations, according to FECInfo, which tracks campaign finance.

No Veto Likely

     The bill before the House is designed to gain approval in the Senate. An administration spokesman said that President George W. Bush is not looking to wield his veto pen.
     ``It depends on what it says, but the president has made it clear he can't be counted on to veto it,'' said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer. ``The president very much wants something
he can sign.''
     In addition to a soft money ban, the bill would limit political advertising close to election time.
     The legislation comes as both parties head toward November's elections, with Democrats controlling the Senate by a single seat out of 100 and Republicans running the House by 11 of the 435 seats.
     The 2000 elections set records for federal spending at about $2.9 billion. This year, both parties are clamoring for cash because fundraising fell off after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The Republican National Committee, for example, raised $49.4 million in the first six months of 2001 and saw that shrink to $32.6 million in the last half of the year.
     Opponents can still try to change the bill on the House floor with provisions designed to weaken it. Ohio Republican Representative Bob Ney has the support of party leaders with his proposal to limit soft money without banning it.

Enron Boosts Supporters

     Enron and its chairman, Ken Lay, were a major backer of the Republican Party in general and Bush in particular. The company gave almost $6 million in federal contributions since 1989,
including more than $3.6 million in soft money, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance.
     Enron's access to the Bush administration, such as Lay's private meeting with Cheney on energy policy last year, has been a target of editorial-writers. Republicans who defend the
administration use strong language in denouncing the current system.
     ``Here we are again, looking squarely in the face of injustice and abuse of power and privilege,'' said Zach Wamp, a Tennessee Republican. ``People should have had enough and they
should demand change.''
     News of the petition's success traveled quickly through the halls of the Capitol after Brown and Neal appeared on the House floor to deliver the last two signatures. Senator Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, interrupted a Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on Enron to announce the ``good news.''

Lobbying Has Begun

     The largest contributor was the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), a labor union that almost $6 million, all to Democrats. The largest corporate contributor was AT&T Corp. at $3.8 million, about 63 percent to Republicans.
     Common Cause, a public interest organization, has dispatched lobbyists to states including Florida and South Dakota to push the bill on radio talk shows and before newspaper editorial boards.
     Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican credited with getting the bill passed in the Senate, may go out on the stump.
     Opponents of the bill include AFSCME, which sent letters to the entire Congress urging them not to support the bill or sign the petition. A soft money ban will hamper voter participation,
the letter said.
     ``This limitation would significantly interfere with the ability of state and local candidates to communicate with the electorate,'' it said.
     Matthew Keller, a Common Cause lobbyist, said he doesn't mind the opposition.
     ``This means it's real again,'' he said.

SEC Chairman Pitt's Plan `Needs More Teeth,' Levitt Says
2002-01-24 12:42 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt's plan for accountant oversight ``needs more teeth,'' and Congress should step in with legislation in the wake of Enron Corp.'s collapse, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt told Congress.
     ``We need a truly independent oversight body,'' Levitt told the Senate Government Affairs Committee, which opened hearings today on Enron's bankruptcy and the role played by its auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP.
     Levitt, a Democrat who headed the SEC from July 1993 to February 2001, also called for a ban on accounting firms' auditing and consulting for the same company. He said companies should be required to change auditors every five to seven years.
     Pitt, a Republican, has proposed a private accountants oversight group that would supervise audit reviews and discipline accountants for incompetence and ethics violations. His plan, which is still being worked out, calls for a majority of the board to be made up of public members, and for the group to be funded by the private sector outside the accounting industry.
     ``The initial Pitt proposal needs more teeth,'' Levitt said. All the board members of the new group should be drawn from the public sector, he said.
     Levitt is now a director of Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News.

Enron Asks Ct For Quick OK Of India Unit Sale To BG Grp
2002-01-24 16:33 (New York)

   By Kathy Chu 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) is asking a federal
bankruptcy court for speedy approval of its  Enron Oil & Gas India unit sale to
BG Group PLC (BRG) for $350 million cash. 

  The transaction must be completed by Feb. 15, according to court documents,
or BG Group, a U.K. oil and gas company,  can walk away. 

  An ""overwhelming need"" exists to promptly close the sale, the distressed
company said in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern
District of New York. Failure to ""expeditiously authorize the approval of the
sale of EOGIL will adversely affect the ability to close on this valuable
transaction,"" according to Enron. 

  The operation, or management rights, of Enron's upstream  oil and gas assets
in India is not a condition of the re-negotiated deal. 

  The energy-trading company - which originally signed a deal to sell the
assets to BG for $388 million - is asking the bankruptcy court for an early
February hearing to consider approval of the transaction.

SEC Considers Post-Enron Changes To Financial Reports
By Judith Burns

01/24/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

SAN DIEGO -(Dow Jones)- Securities regulators are looking at ways to improve corporate financial reports in light of the collapse of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), senior Securities and Exchange Commission officials said Thursday.
Changes such as greater scrutiny of Fortune 500 companies already have been announced. Others are in the works, including a proposal to permit companies to provide streamlined financial reports and include information on trends and other nonfinancial topics, SEC officials said. They gave the customary disclaimer that their remarks reflect their own views, not those of the SEC. 
""Enron has been very harmful, in devastating ways, to a lot of people, and the regulatory system did not prevent that,"" SEC general counsel David Becker said at Northwestern University law conference here. He said that has prompted regulators to consider changes to prevent similar accounting blowups in the future. 
For starters, the SEC will begin screening annual reports filed by Fortune 500 companies, beginning this month when 2001 reports are filed with the agency. 
If screening indicates a need for further scrutiny, ""we will undertake a review,"" promised Alan Beller, director of the SEC's corporation finance division, speaking to the same group. ""There will be no communication with the company"" in the process, he added. 
The SEC hasn't said what might trigger concerns, but officials noted the agency has highlighted the need for better management discussion and analysis in corporate annual reports, including of off-balance sheet items and related party transactions, two areas that tripped up Enron. 
Enron, formerly ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500, went bankrupt last year after announcing it had overstated four-and-a-half years' worth of earnings. The Houston energy company and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, are under investigation by the SEC, the Justice Department and various congressional committees. 
In response, SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt proposed creating a new private organization to oversee U.S. accountants and auditors. Becker said he hopes that will lead to reform, ""rather than recrimination."" 
Pitt's past ties to accountants - he represented Big Five firms in his private legal practice - isn't fair game for critics, Becker suggested. He said critics should focus ""on the substance"" of Pitt's proposal and not attribute a ""darker motive"" to him based on his ""former clients."" 
""All that counts, everything that counts, is what works"" to protect investors, Becker said. 
Even before Enron's collapse, critics complained its financial reports obscured the company's real condition and have called for more disclosure of off-balance sheet items and deals. 
To that end, SEC chief accountant Robert Herdman said the SEC is likely to propose new rules to require better disclosure of corporate accounting policies, building on already issued guidance. 
""I guarantee there's going to be something out well before the end of this year,"" Herdman said Wednesday. 
Corporate decisions such as choosing an aggressive or conservative approach can have a huge impact on reported earnings, a fact Herdman said may be lost on investors. 
The SEC may require companies to identify critical accounting policies that affect reported earnings, making that ""a required component of management discussion and analysis,"" Herdman said. 
""Accounting doesn't all come down to one number,"" Herdman stressed. While companies report precise earnings per share, he said a range of estimates may be ""closer to the truth"" than a single number. 
Another change being considered by the SEC, which Herdman outlined Thursday, would allow companies to provide shortened summary financial reports showing key results. 
""We think this has a lot of potential,"" said Herdman. ""We're building a prototype now."" 
The SEC floated a similar plan in the past, but withdrew it in the face of strong objections from investors who feared summary reports would omit important details. Corporations also blasted the idea, citing concerns that condensed reports could trigger more lawsuits from aggrieved investors. 
However, Internet technology could make the idea more appealing now and resolve those concerns, said Herdman. 
Herdman said he'd like the SEC to post a sample on the Internet, allowing investors to test how they could use a streamlined financial report with hypertext links to see as much or as little information as they want. 
Whether companies would still need to provide printed copies of complete financial reports to investors if the SEC approves streamlined reports is still being debated, along with technical matters such as whether the SEC's computers would be able to handle such reports. 
In addition to mulling condensed financial reports, Herdman said the SEC is considering other changes that would allow corporations to report nonfinancial information such as industry or corporate trends. Whether the SEC should require companies to disclose this information, or simply permit them to do so if they wish, has yet to be decided, he added.

The Real Values Crisis Behind the Enron Collapse

Commentary By Michael S. Malone
Editor-at-Large, Forbes ASAP
Special to ABCNEWS.com

Jan. 24 - The Enron scandal is really about a crisis of values - including one nobody seems to have noticed. 


Some of the values in disarray in this case are visible to everyone. There is, for example the most obvious one: How did a company with assets of only a few hundred million dollars, or at most a couple billion, have a market value of $100 billion? 
This, of course, isn't Enron's fault, but ours. We're the ones who drove the stock price up over $100 at the height of the boom. We're the ones who actually believed that companies like Enron could, in our lifetimes, actually grow their earnings to justify such stratospheric, and historically unprecedented, multiples. Why did we believe it, despite all reason? Because we were greedy. 
Then there is the value crisis of the industry analysts, those morons who were still putting out ""buy"" notices on Enron even after it was apparent to even the most dimwitted observer that the companies was a dangerous house of cards. Either these people were perfect fools and dupes (which is precisely what they were hired not to be), or shills for Enron, or were covering their own investments. Whatever, they placed their own interests over the needs of their clients and the public at large. 
Next comes the cravenness of our elected representatives. So far, Enron's well-placed sacks of money seemed to have bought more largesse from the Clinton Adminstration than the Bush (big surprise), but that is hardly any consolation. The bottom line is that everybody Congress to the White House, GOP and Dem, took the money and then they took the calls. Do you think you could call the Treasury Secretary and get a prompt reply? 
Drinking the Kool-Aid 
Then, of course, there is the management of Enron. In certain areas I'm a little more sympathetic than most people to Kenneth Lay and his gang of idiots. I've spent my life around entrepreneurial teams, and I know well how important it is to believe the plan, to drink the Kool-Aid. You have to act like a billion dollar company even as the office equipment company is repossessing the furniture. 
I even understand why the company put such a large percentage of its own stock in the employee 401(k) plan: it thought it was doing the employees a huge favor. The employees thought so too - I don't remember any of them complaining about it when the stock was hovering around $100. 
But one thing was reprehensible: That was when Lay, after he knew the company was going down, still promoted the purchase of company stock to his own employees and to the world at large. That was an unforgivable moral lapse. 
If he was a man of honor he would personally buy back every share bought by employees and private investors in the days after that announcement. If he is financially destroyed in the process, too bad, that's what standing by your values is all about. 
Keeping Up with the Hyperspeed Economy 
That brings us to Arthur Andersen - and the crisis no one is talking about. The obvious scandal is that Arthur Andersen's audit team once again failed miserably. Was it incompetence or conflict of interest? 
If there is any part of this story that demands an investigation - by Congress, by Justice, by the accounting industry itself - it is the moral failure of a leading firm in the profession to fulfill its moral duty to unflinchingly, and without bias, uncover the truth and present to the weak, the vulnerable and those without influence or voice. 
But we can't stop at Arthur Andersen. The real ""values"" crisis represented by the Enron mess is far deeper, and stretches across our economy. We are all being victimized by it, and the situation is growing ever worse. It is the great unreported business story of our time: the growing failure of the accounting system to accurately capture what is going in the new hyperspeed economy. 
Simply put, we have no idea what any company is worth today. The accounting industry is mired in a system that was devised 600 years ago and has only been fine-tuned ever since. It doesn't work any more. Accountants know it, corporate executives know it, and the stock market knows it. 
The general recognition of this fact has led to a widespread ethical sloppiness made manifest in such things as Arthur Andersen's apparent conflict. The reality is that the only time anybody really checks an audit anymore is after a financial disaster like Enron, when scapegoats must be found. 
Rear-View Mirror Accounting 
I once likened traditional accounting to driving a car by only looking in the rear view mirror. It can tell you where a company has recently been, but it is unable to tell you where that company is now. And in a world in which change occurs in nanoseconds, such obsolete data is worthless. 
Today, events arrive so swiftly, and change so constant, that it is no longer even enough to operate in the present. Modern business now runs in the future. The result is a growing gap between traditional ""book"" value and actual market value - and through that gap drives not only companies like Enron, but truly valuable firms like General Electric and Intel. 
Traditional accounting has long dealt with that gap through a line entry entitled ""goodwill."" But it was typically only added when a company sold for more than the total value of its inventory, buildings, etc. At most, this goodwill only represented a few percent of the total value. 
That was then. In the modern economy, for great, fast moving, innovative young companies this so-called ""goodwill"" can represent 90 percent of their value. When a corporate audit can only tell us about ten percent of a company, what the hell is the point? 
There have been a number of efforts in recent years to come up with innovative new ways to determine corporate value, many of them under the all-encompassing terms ""intellectual capital"" or ""intangible assets"". But they are still in their earliest stages, and most slam up against the formidable wall of the traditional accounting industry. 
Perhaps the Enron scandal will finally open our eyes. Maybe even a few company executives and Arthur Andersen accountants will go to jail. Maybe even, wish upon wish, the SEC will demand more timely and encompassing financial reporting. 
But have no illusions. There will be many more Enrons in the years ahead. And until we fix this problem, we are thrashing about without direction. We are blind.

More Enrons to come?
By Wolf Blitzer
CNN Wolf Blitzer Reports
January 24, 2002
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- By now, we have all heard the Enron horror stories about how employees there lost virtually their entire life savings when the once-huge energy giant became the largest bankruptcy in American history. Lest we forget -- it wasn't very long ago when Enron was the seventh largest company in the United States. 
I spoke with two former Enron employees the other day and heard their very sad stories. Roger Boyce worked in the field of safety and security for Enron in Minneapolis. Just months ago his retirement plan was worth more than $2 million. He's now retired, and his plan is worth ""probably about $3,000."" He's taken a nearly $2 million hit. 
He may have worked in the field of safety and security, but he personally wound up with neither. 
Janice Farmer was an Enron administrator in Orlando. She told me her retirement plan was once worth $700,000. ""I was able to sell my stock before it actually hit the rock bottom,"" she said. ""I sold at $4 and a penny [per share], and I received a check for $20,418."" That's about a $680,000 hit. 
These are not isolated horror stories. Unfortunately, there are thousands of them. And what makes the matter even sadder is the fact that some of the top Enron executives sold their stock earlier and were able to make tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars. 
""I think it is becoming increasingly clear that employees and retirees were more than victimized by the Enron executives,"" Farmer said bitterly. ""We were sacrificed for their own personal gain."" 
Boyce agreed. ""It should never have happened. There were risks that companies should never take, and they took it, and we're the victims."" 
The Enron collapse has now been followed by the bankruptcy of another U.S. business giant -- Kmart. Indeed, most of us probably had never heard of Enron only a few months ago; all of us know the retail giant Kmart. 
I asked Steve Forbes, the President and CEO of Forbes, Inc, and former Republican presidential candidate, to tell me the difference between Enron and Kmart. As usual, he was blunt. 
Enron, he said, collapsed not only because of bad management, but because that management ""went over the edge on fraud."" Kmart, on the other hand, is today in dire straits because of bad management. He noted that ten years ago, Kmart had the same sales as Wal-Mart. Today, Wal-Mart has six times the sales of Kmart. ""They didn't relocate into more profitable areas,"" Forbes told me. ""They didn't keep up in terms of having good inventory systems, which Wal-Mart did. So that was a case of purely bad management."" 
Forbes also pointed out that there are other huge companies out there already in deep financial trouble though he refused to name names. ""But you look at areas, and the telecoms, there are still some disasters to come,"" he said. ""They are overloaded with debt. And as a matter of fact, in terms of Enron, where the focus is right now, we have had huge busts in telecommunications and dot-coms. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been lost."" 
So get ready for more roller-coaster rides as the economy shakes itself out. Remember -- don't make the mistake in trusting your retirement plans to only one or two investments. Diversify.

Natural Gas Futures Slip Lower


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX ended down $0.053
yesterday at $2.228 per MMBtu. The March contract also lost $0.053
and finished at $2.232 per MMBtu. The market opened down and
continued to slowly slide most of the day reaching a low of $2.14 per
MMBtu before the AGA released the weekly storage report data. The AGA
showed a withdrawal of 190 Bcf for last week, somewhat more than was
expected by most. The market jumped higher after the report and
finished on an up-tick. Even though the year-on-year deficit was
reduced by 23 Bcf, there is still a long way to go with 1.1 Bcf more
in storage than a year ago. There is now 2.67 Tcf in storage and it
is about 81% full. A year ago, only 1.562 Tcf was in storage. Storage
inventories are 58% above where they were a year ago and 26% above
the AGA's 5-year average of 2,124 Bcf. Look for the market to
continue higher today mainly on short-covering. Natural gas for next
day delivery across the US and Canada was general down $0.05  $0.10
yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost
$0.07 to $2.31 per MMBtu.

Ex-Worker Threatens Nuclear Plant Employees

    Employees at Edison Internationals San Onofre nuclear power plant
were allegedly threatened by a former maintenance worker who was
fired last month. The nuclear plant was not in danger as the alleged
verbal threats were made at another location. The man was arrested on
charges of making deadly threats, storing weapons in the reach of a
minor, possession of a concealed weapon in a vehicle and possession
of illegal ammunition. Deputies found 42 weapons at the suspect's
home and another 250 at a storage facility. Law enforcement officials
also found 3,000 to 4,000 rounds of ammunition and 4 hand grenades at
the storage facility. While opening an ammunition container 2
deputies were exposed to a yellow gas, thought to be tear gas. Edison
owns 75% of the nuclear station, Sempra owns 20% and two California
towns own the other 5%.

Government and Auto Makers to Develop Fuel Cells

    The DOE and the US Council for Automotive Research, an
organization formed by GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler to speed up fuel
efficiency research, have agreed to fund a new program called
FreedomCar to develop hydrogen-based fuel cells for use in cars. The
agreement will require significant investment by the automobile
industry and the federal government, the council said. The new
program represents the government's commitment to devote research and
development money and future policy toward hydrogen as an eventual
replacement for gasoline, according to the DOE. FreedomCAR replaces
the Partnership for a New Generation Vehicle, whose goal was to
develop a car that gets 80 miles per gallon of fuel. PNGV was a
partnership between federal agencies, Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler to
develop a car with 3 times the fuel efficiency of a 1994 model by
2004. The 2002 federal fiscal budget had allotted $127 million for
PNGV. The 2003 budget allotment for FreedomCAR will not be known
until the president submits his budget to Congress in a few weeks.
The program is open to all auto makers, not just domestic car
manufacturers, leaving the door open for Toyota, Honda, etc. to join
if they wish. FreedomCAR might also include suppliers from the
hydrogen production industry. Currently, fuel cells cost about $400
per kW of energy produced and last for about 3,000 hours. In order to
be competitive with combustible engines, fuel cells need to be priced
about $40 per kW and last about 5,000 hours, or about 120,000 miles.
Fuel cells can obtain hydrogen from a variety of sources, including
methanol and natural gas. Fuel cell-powered vehicles have not been
introduced because they are more expensive than gasoline-powered
vehicles and there is no commercial fuel delivery system. The US has
only 2 hydrogen-fueling stations for cars in operation, which are not
open to the public, compared to about 1,300 fueling stations for
vehicles that run on compressed natural gas and even more for those
that run on propane. The DOE secretary said that he thinks that the
nations carbon-based economy may pass from the scene to perhaps be
replaced by hydrogen. The DOE held meetings last year with auto
makers, energy suppliers, fuel cell manufacturers and educational
experts to create a plan for how a hydrogen-based economy would
operate. Currently a consensus on whether hydrogen should be shipped
through a pipe or made at the end point by electricity does not
exist. Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler have each said they plan to have
some fuel-cell vehicles commercially available by 2004.

EIA Says 2002 Natural Gas Prices to Average Just $2.05

    High storage inventories are expected to keep downward pressure
on natural gas prices throughout most of the year, according to the
EIA. However, a sharp downturn in drilling activity and growing
demand should rally prices for 2003, but for 2002 pressure on
domestic wellhead prices will keep them near $2 per Mcf, the agency
in its latest short-term energy outlook. Wellhead  prices are
expected to average $2.05 per Mcf this year before jumping to $2.65
per Mcf in 2003. Both estimates reflect dramatic reductions from the
2001 average of $4.14 per Mcf. The agency's quarterly and annual
price estimates are up slightly from its December report, when EIA
pegged the 2002 gas price at $1.96 per Mcf.

PJM and Midwest ISO Plan Common Market

    The PJM Interconnection and the Midwest ISO plan to form a common
wholesale electric market that would cover 27 states, plus the
District of Columbia and Manitoba. The plan is still preliminary, but
the parties have released an unexecuted letter of intent, which they
will discuss with the member committees on January 16th and 17th. The
market would affect about 32 million people. It would include
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and Washington DC, plus
the portions of West Virginia and Ohio served by Allegheny Energy,
which will form PJM West this year, along with Duquesne Light. The
Midwest ISO includes Manitoba, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Wyoming, Minnesota, Wisconsin, part of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas,
Missouri, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. The letter
of intent states that the market will facilitate wholesale markets,
both in areas where retail electric industry restructuring is
occurring, as well as areas where retail restructuring is still being
evaluated. The market will allow the larger region to rapidly realize
the benefits that industry restructuring at the wholesale level had
otherwise promised but not yet fully achieved. Detail are still
sketchy, they could not say how transmission might be coordinated,
nor which electric products might be included. However, PJM
emphasized that it would not be a merger of the ISOs and do not yet
have an estimated time frame for startup.

Western Resources Sues PNM

    In a bid to salvage a $4.5 billion sale of its utilities, Western
Resources has said that PNM cannot cancel the deal while decisions by
regulators that a condition of the sale was unlawful and an ordered
rate cut is under appeal. Western Resources, which is suing to force
PNM to complete the sale, detailed its position in a letter to PNM,
which was disclosed in a SEC filing. PNM, New Mexico's largest
utility, has formally rescinded its offer to purchase Westerns KPL
and KGE units. According to PNM, Kansas regulators effectively killed
the deal last July when they rejected Western's plan to place the
utilities into a separate company, a condition of the sale, and cut
customer power rates, lowering the utilities' expected revenue. After
the regulatory decision, the companies entered into negotiations,
which broke down last August. PNM filed suit against Western in
October to end the sale and win unspecified damages. Western in turn
filed suit in November, seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in
damages from PNM for breach of contact. The purchase agreement called
for PNM to pay 55 million shares, worth $1.6 billion and assume $2.9
billion of debt. In the termination letter, PNM said Western is
unlikely to overturn the regulators' rejection of the purchase, and
the rate cut will have a materially adverse effect on the business.
PNM claims those conditions give it the right to cancel the sale
without paying a breakup fee of up to $35 million. Western Resources
says that it is working to reach a settlement with the regulators by
the merger deadline at the end of this year and that doubts about its
success does not give PNM the legal right to withdraw.

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Democrats Try to Make Hay of Enron Fall --- Lieberman to Hold Hearings As Party Aims to Play Up Company's Ties to GOP
By Michael Schroeder and Tom Hamburger
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- In a moment of bipartisan candor, a Republican strategist recently confided to a Democratic friend that if he were in Democrats' place, he would ""beat up"" the GOP over its ties to the fallen energy giant, Enron Corp. 
It looks like the Democrats are going to try to do just that.
The new year at the Capitol -- a congressional-election year -- opened yesterday with an announcement from Sen. Joseph Lieberman that the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which he heads, will hold hearings into Enron's collapse when Congress returns to work later this month. That word from the former Democratic vice-presidential nominee -- who is a presidential prospect for 2004 -- is just the latest of a number of inquiries into a company with closer ties than any to President Bush. 
The Connecticut senator noted that the company and its chairman, Bush friend Kenneth Lay, were active in helping draft the Bush administration's energy plan. Mr. Lieberman added, ""We have got to ask whether the advice rendered was at all self-serving."" 
Mr. Lieberman emphasized that Enron's connections to the Bush administration aren't the focus of his committee's inquiry; instead, he says it will center on the precipitous collapse and what might have been done -- including by the government -- to prevent it. But Democratic operatives have been urging Mr. Lieberman, as the best-placed committee chairman, to dig into the issue, believing further exposure can only embarrass Republicans and Mr. Bush, whose own ties to Enron and Mr. Lay date back to the president's race for Texas governor. 
Enron, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas, filed for bankruptcy-court protection following a crisis of confidence among its investors. Enron wrote off $1 billion of assets in November, revised downward its earnings of the past several years and took a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The problems have resulted largely from Enron's dealings with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives. The company saw its market value plunge recently to about $500 million from more than $77 billion last year. 
Financial regulators had little clue what was going on inside Enron, which had major positions in little-regulated derivatives markets. That is at least partly because the Houston company had invested a lot of time and money in Washington to keep the government out of its business, and to foster GOP support for deregulation of energy and financial industries. 
Now, a half-dozen congressional panels and several federal agencies are investigating aspects of Enron's Chapter 11 reorganization. In Congress, Democrats in particular are emphasizing the numerous investors left holding stock worth pennies, the thousands of Enron employees out of work and those with retirement savings built on worthless company stock. 
It remains to be seen if the issue will resonate with voters. For one thing, Enron's energy-trading business is extremely complex; for another, some Democrats also benefited from Enron's largesse -- though hardly as much as Republicans have. Since 1990, the company has given three-quarters of its campaign donations to GOP causes. Al Gore's presidential campaign against Mr. Bush received $13,700 from Enron executives during the 2000 campaign cycle; Mr. Bush's campaign got $114,000 and his party far more. 
The Democrats' rhetorical line of attack is already clear. ""The only wholly owned subsidiary of Enron not to go bankrupt is the Republican Party,"" said Robert Gibbs, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ""Enron is a huge problem for the Republicans, and it will keep tying them in knots."" 
Two House Financial Services subcommittees held the first of numerous planned hearings last month, but those were notable for a bipartisan tone. Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the committee's senior Democrat, joined chairman Mike Oxley, an Ohio Republican, in calling for a swift and thorough investigation. ""We are trying to focus on the criminal, not the political,"" Mr. Oxley said. 
But Sen. Lieberman has shifted the tone. While he too emphasized a desire to remain bipartisan, he announced the hearings without his committee's chief Republican, Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee. He did consult with Mr. Thompson beforehand. 
The Democrat driving the issue to date has been Rep. Henry Waxman of California, but he is hampered by the fact that Democrats are the minority in the House. Last month, Mr. Waxman demanded that Vice President Dick Cheney disclose Enron's and Mr. Lay's role in crafting the administration's energy plan. Mr. Waxman and other Democrats on the House Government Reform Committee also started an ""Enron tip-line"" to solicit information about any alleged wrongdoing. 
Meanwhile, Republicans have gone on the offensive. Last Friday, in answer to a reporter's question, Mr. Bush said Enron must be held accountable. ""There will be a lot of government inquiry into Enron and what took place there,"" he said. ""I'm deeply concerned about the citizens of Houston who worked for Enron who lost life savings."" 
But Rep. John Dingell, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has been raising questions about the failure of regulators to sniff out Enron's problems. 
In early December, he wrote Mr. Bush's appointee to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Harvey Pitt, demanding a thorough SEC investigation of Enron and attaching a long list of questions about its possible accounting violations. 
Separately, GOP Reps. Billy Tauzin, who heads the House energy committee, and James Greenwood, chairman of its Oversight and Investigations subcommittee, are preparing for February hearings into the role of regulators and the accounting industry in Enron's failure. 
Outside Washington, Enron already is shaping up as a political liability in its Texas home and elsewhere. For years, Enron has been among the best-known underwriters of political campaigns in Texas. But in the state's race for attorney general, both Democrat and Republican candidates have said they plan to return some or all donations from the company. 
And the decision of Mr. Bush's successor, Gov. Rick Perry, to appoint a former top Enron executive as chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission has produced a storm of protest. Two Texas citizen groups have called for an inquiry into the appointment, and the Dallas Morning News has urged the current GOP attorney general, John Cornyn, to rule on the eligibility of the Enron executive to serve in light of conflict-of-interest rules. 
Mr. Cornyn, like the Republican governor, has received more than $100,000 in contributions from Enron through the years. Moreover, he's now seeking the Senate seat held by Republican Sen. Phil Gramm, who is retiring. Yet the vulnerability of some Democrats is apparent here, too: A top Democratic candidate for the Senate seat is Rep. Ken Bentsen, who received more Enron contributions -- $42,750 -- than any House member. 
In California, meanwhile, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has suggested that Enron may have contributed to the energy crisis that struck his state last year. ""I take no joy in Enron's troubles,"" he said last month. But, he added in a swipe aimed at the company, ""Some of the companies providing power were driving a very hard bargain, I believe taking advantage of California."" Earlier this year, the state's Democratic attorney general, William Lockyer, subpoenaed Enron's electricity-trading records in an attempt to show that the state was a victim of price gouging. 
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called on the Justice and Labor departments to probe whether Enron violated laws governing the retirement plans for thousands of its employees. On average, employees had more than 60% of their retirement savings in Enron shares, and because they had little flexibility to diversify or sell, many lost as much as 90% of their retirement assets when the share price plunged.

Senate panel to investigate Enron
by Shanon D. Murray in Washington

Copyright (c) 2002 The Deal LLC

The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Jan. 2 became the fourth congressional group to launch an Enron-related investigation. More could be coming. 
Yet another congressional committee will issue subpoenas next week for corporate documents crucial to its inquiry into regulatory oversight of Enron Corp., two senators said Jan. 2.
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee became the fourth congressional panel to launch an Enron-related probe, joining the Justice and Labor departments and the Securities and Exchange Commission. And more could be coming. Democrats on the Senate Commerce Committee have asked the Federal Trade Commission to launch its own investigation. 
At a Capitol Hill news conference Wednesday, Sen. Joe Lieberman, the chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs panel, said the committee will hold its first Enron-related hearing Jan. 24 to vet whether any ""cracks"" in the systems at various regulatory agencies, including the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, contributed to the company's collapse. 
""This is a search for the truth, not a witch hunt,"" said Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat. 
Meanwhile, Carl Levin, chairman of the committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said he will subpoena documents next week from Enron's current and former directors, top company officials and its auditor, Arthur Andersen. 
The subcommittee will examine how the energy giant was governed and audited and how it used special-purpose entities, offshore entities and limited partnerships to conduct its business. 
The subcommittee will spend the next few months gathering and analyzing the documentary trail, and hearings from those subpoenas will be held later in the year, Levin said at the news conference. 
The subcommittee ""will use its subpoena authority to investigate what appears to be a massive shell game with multiple layers of conflicts of interests,"" Levin said. 
""Thorough investigations are needed, and from different perspectives, to determine whether current law was violated and where current law is inadequate to protect the public interest,"" he said. 
Lieberman said the Enron investigation will be a committee priority when it returns from recess later this month. That appears to be true for much of Congress as well as federal regulatory agencies. 
Since Enron's bankruptcy filing Dec. 2, the Senate Commerce Committee, the House Financial Services Committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee and now the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee have launched investigations. 
The SEC and Labor investigations could result in civil charges while the Justice Department's inquiries could result in criminal charges. ""We'll do our best to coordinate with our colleagues,"" Lieberman said. 
Levin said overlapping investigations do not worry him. ""There is more than enough work for the House and the Senate,"" Levin said after the news conference. ""The problem is there is so much to look at that there may be some pieces not investigated. That's my fear."" 
While Lieberman said the committee has not decided whether to ask Enron chairman Kenneth Lay or other company executives to testify, he did note that he ""wouldn't consider an investigation complete without hearing from them."" 
Levin said the subcommittee intends to take depositions where appropriate. 
Lay has previously declined to appear at congressional hearings but has committed to testifying before the Senate Commerce Committee in February. 
Meanwhile, late Wednesday, Andersen released a statement saying a review of its accounting and auditing quality ""has been deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards"" and has been accepted by the Peer Review Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
Deloitte & Touche conducted the review, which evaluated whether Andersen's system of quality control for its accounting and auditing practice meets standards set by the AICPA. Firms are reviewed every three years, but Andersen's review was expanded after financial reporting issues emerged at Enron, the firms said. 
In a comment letter, Deloitte & Touche recommended several changes Andersen should undertake but said those items ""were not considered to be of sufficient significance to affect the opinion expressed in [the] report."" But the report doesn't absolve Andersen. DT said the restatement of financial statements audited by a firm ""generally involve numerous factors, many of which are unrelated to the effectiveness of a firm's quality control system.""

Enron case shows 'very clear suggestions of deception' - US Senator Lieberman

01/02/2002

(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - Senator Joseph Lieberman said there are ""very, very clear suggestions of deception"" at Enron Corp and Congress is determined to discover what caused the downfall of the Houston-based energy trading group. 
Several US senators have called for the Department of Justice to investigate the share dealings of Enron Corp's senior executives and to also probe why an employee pension fund was locked down at a time when executives continued to sell their Enron stock holdings as the company's fortunes dwindled.
""This is the largest company ever to declare bankruptcy. Thousands of employees of Enron have lost their jobs, many thousands more have had their retirement savings evaporated. Unless we take a look at what happened here, we're not going to be able to protect everybody else who has a 401(K) (pension scheme) that is run by their company,"" Lieberman said in a interview with CNN. 
There are ""very, very clear suggestions of deception,"" the Democratic senator said without expanding further on the allegation. 
Enron retirees have told lawmakers that the company's executive board locked them out of accessing their 401(K) pension funds when Enron's fortunes started to spiral downwards into bankruptcy. 
Enron's management decided to change the company's pension plan administrators on Oct 17 -- one day after the company's third-quarter financial results led to a 1.2 bln usd restated reduction of shareholders' equity -- thereby locking in employees from selling Enron stock in their retirement funds for some two weeks. 
Retirees and some lawmakers, allege that Enron chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth Lay and other executives shed millions of dollars in stock while they were locked out from accessing their retirement benefits over this period. 
""That's one of the things that we're going to determine in this investigation... we'll be looking at the activities of the board of directors to see what role they played in the collapse,"" said Democratic Senator Carl Levin, who was also interviewed by CNN. 
""We're hoping that this investigation will contribute to equity finally being given to the stockholders and the employees of Enron,"" Levin added. 
Lieberman chairs the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee which plans to hold a series of hearings into Enron's collapse during late January and early February.

Senate committee to investigate Enron collapse
By H. JOSEF HEBERT

WASHINGTON (AP) - Enron's business practices had the mark of ""a massive shell game with multiple layers of conflict of interest,"" says a senator who plans to subpoena documents as part of a broad investigation into the energy company's collapse. 
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Governmental Affairs investigations subcommittee, said his committee will within weeks subpoena documents from Enron's board of directors, senior managers and its auditing firm.
At the same time, the full Governmental Affairs Committee will hold a hearing Jan. 24 into why government regulators failed to see the ""red flags"" at Enron and protect investors and the company's employees who have lost hundreds of millions of dollars as Enron stock plummeted. 
Enron Corp., filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2 as its stock fell from a high of $90 a share a year ago to less than $1. Thousands of Enron workers were prevented from selling Enron stock in their 401k retirement plan during the collapse. 
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the full committee's chairman, promised Wednesday ""a search for the truth, not a witch hunt."" But he did not rule out an examination of Enron's relationships with the Bush administration. 
""We're going to go wherever the search takes us,"" Lieberman said at a news conference, noting Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay's involvement in crafting the administration's energy agenda last spring. ""We've got to ask whether the advice rendered (by Lay) was at all self serving."" 
Lay, a longtime friend of the president, was a prominent contributor and fund raiser for Bush's presidential campaign. Other Enron executives also gave significantly to Bush's campaign, according to the watchdog Center for Public Integrity. 
The Senate committee's initial focus will be on why the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other regulators did not foresee the problems and raise concern about Enron's business practices. 
""The untimely and wholly unexpected failure of a corporate giant like Enron is an alarm call to all of us in government,"" said Lieberman. He said it has sent shockwaves into the investment community and concern about energy industry deregulation. 
Levin's subcommittee planned to target Enron's board of directors and auditors to determine what they knew of Enron's sometimes secretive business dealings, including the use of questionable partnerships and what Levin called ""offshore entities."" 
Internal Enron documents reportedly show that top company officials were directly involved in the creation and oversight of the partnerships, and that they viewed them as crucial to company growth - even as they disguised an estimated $500 million in Enron debt not included on the company's books. 
The procedures set up by Enron required former chief executive and president Jeff Skilling and two other senior Enron officials to approve all transactions with the partnerships, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing the documents. 
Levin said he was dismayed about ""what appears to be a massive shell game with multiple layers of conflict of interest"" that contributed to Enron's collapse at a time when most investors believed the company to be thriving. 
Top Enron executives and directors ""apparently reaped almost $1 billion in stock sales in 2000 and 2001,"" said Levin, while hundreds of Enron workers were barred from selling Enron stock in their 401k retirement fund during the company's collapse. 
Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the subcommittee's ranking Republican, said in a statement that she wants to know whether Enron executives and board members, when selling their stock, ""knew of the company's impending financial situation."" 
Enron - once the seventh largest in the country in terms of revenue - filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2. 
Last month, during a House hearing, Arthur Andersen LLP defended its work for Enron, but its chief executive conceded shortcomings in the accounting profession. ""Our system of regulation and discipline will have to be improved,"" said Anderson chief Joseph Berardino. 
On Wednesday, Andersen released the results of an independent review that found the company's work provides ""reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards."" The review was conducted by another accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche. 
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee is among a half dozen committees and subcommittees expected to hold hearings in both the House and Senate in the coming months on Enron's collapse, one of the largest ever. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Labor Department also have investigations under way.

Enron probe could reach Bush: Backed campaign: Senate committee to focus on directors' role, partnerships

WASHINGTON - Fallen energy giant Enron Corp. faces further scrutiny on Capitol Hill with another committee announcing yesterday it would probe the company's collapse, possibly looking at connections between Enron and the White House. 
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's permanent subcommittee on investigations will subpoena documents next week and hold a hearing on Jan. 24.
A Wall Street darling just a few months ago, Enron on Dec. 2 made the largest bankruptcy court filing in U.S. history after a rescue takeover by rival Dynegy Inc. fell apart amid investor concerns about Enron's murky finances. 
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, who chairs the full government affairs committee, did not rule out looking into connections between Enron and the administration of George W. Bush. 
Enron was a major backer of President Bush's election campaign. ""There are some interconnections here with the Bush administration, but that is not the focus of this investigation,"" said Mr. Lieberman, a Democrat. 
Sen. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chairs the subcommittee, said the investigation would focus on the role of Enron's directors in the collapse; accounting firm Andersen, which audited Enron's financial statements; and the company's use of complex financial partnerships. 
Houston-based Enron is under investigation in Washington by at least five congressional committees, the market-regulating Securities and Exchange Commission and the departments of Justice and Labor. 
Reports recently emerged that a week before filing for bankruptcy protection, Enron contributed US$100,000 to Democrats after giving nearly all its prior donations this year to Republicans. 
The money went to the organization that aids Senate Democratic candidates, but a recently hired attorney for Enron insisted the donations were unrelated to congressional investigations. 
Robert Bennett, a lawyer who represented former president Bill Clinton and other high-profile clients, said the money was pledged months before Enron's collapse prompted the congressional inquiries. Rather, he said, the shift reflected the Democrats taking control of the Senate this year. 
""Donations of this type reflect certain political realities which are followed by all major corporations,"" Mr. Bennett said yesterday about Enron's US$50,000 cheques on Nov. 25 and Nov. 26 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. 
Once ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of top companies, Enron's stock closed at US63 cents, up US3 cents on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday -- off from an August, 2000, high of US$90.56. 
Thousands of Enron employees have lost their jobs and much of their retirement savings. A 401(k) retirement plan that made many of them heavily dependent on company stock came under fire at a congressional hearing last month when employees said they were unable to sell their holdings when the stock price plunged. 
In other developments yesterday, Enron bankruptcy judge Arthur Gonzalez put off ruling on whether to compel Jeffrey McMahon, Enron chief financial officer, to testify about why the company filed for Chapter 11 protection in New York rather than Houston. 
Dynegy and other unsecured creditors want Mr. McMahon to give deposition testimony on Enron's choice of venue for the bankruptcy filing. They've asked Judge Gonzalez to transfer the largest bankruptcy case ever to Houston, where Enron is based. 
Enron opposes the request to order Mr. McMahon's testimony, calling it ""unnecessary, unduly burdensome, and disruptive."" 
""Courts have repeatedly recognized that demands for depositions of high-ranking corporate officers are often misused as a tool of harassment and should not be allowed unless there is no other source for the same information,"" Enron said in a motion filed Monday seeking to quash the request.

Enron Probe to Include Regulators

WASHINGTON -- When the Senate convenes this month, a top priority for its Governmental Affairs Committee will be to investigate whether holes in the regulatory safety net played a role in the quick and costly collapse of the energy trading titan Enron Corp., committee Chairman Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said Wednesday. 
Government regulators, outside auditors, and equity analysts will share the hot seat with Enron officials when Sens. Lieberman and Carl Levin, D-Mich., who chairs the panel's permanent subcommittee on investigations, begin their probe Jan. 24.
Sen. Lieberman said the policies of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Labor Department will come under scrutiny. 
""Both of us will be looking to identify the loopholes or failures in our current laws and regulatory schemes that allowed this disaster to happen,"" Sen. Levin said. ""The full committee will be looking at what the experts are saying about the collapse and what role various federal agencies had in overseeing Enron."" 
The subcommittee will examine Enron from the inside to learn what its directors and officials knew and how they behaved, he said. Subpoenas for documents from Enron's top officials are expected soon. 
Andersen, Enron's auditor, will also be scrutinized, as will the analysts who covered the company, Sen. Levin said. ""Something was rotten in the state of Enron, and a lot of knowledgeable people on Wall Street were either duped, didn't care, or purposefully went along for the ride."" 
Sen. Lieberman said that the ""built-in protections"" of independent analysts and auditors failed, and that he will call on ""experts on investing and regulation of the financial markets, energy and derivative trading, and pensions and retirement savings"" to find the system's flaws.

Andersen To Improve Audit Practices After Peer Review

01/03/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Andersen said a peer review found that its accounting and auditing quality provides reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards, but in response to certain comments, it has taken, or will take, the recommended steps to improve its accounting and auditing practices. 
Deloitte & Touche conducted the peer review, the scope of which was expanded after financial reporting issues emerged at Enron Corp. (ENE).
In a press release Wednesday, Andersen said Deloitte & Touche's opinion was ""unmodified,"" without qualification, yet three issues, which weren't deemed significant enough to affect the opinion, were raised in an attached comment letter. 
The comments related to documentation of certain auditing procedures on some engagements; communications with audit committees in some instances; and management representation letters that needed more tailoring in some cases, Andersen said. 
Earlier Wednesday, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said the subcommittee will issue subpoenas to Andersen, Enron's outside auditor, next week as part of an investigation into the financial collapse of Enron. 
In testimony prepared for delivery to subcommittees of the House Financial Services Committee last month, Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino defended the firm's audit of Enron but said accountants will have to make changes to restore confidence after Enron's fall. 
Berardino rejected suggestions that fees paid by Enron for auditing and consulting may have affected Andersen's work for the Houston energy company. 
The expanded Deloitte & Touche peer review of Andersen covered the controls and procedures at Andersen's Houston office, which was responsible for Enron's audits. 
In total, the peer and Andersen's internal practice review looked at 240 Andersen audit engagements in more than 30 Andersen offices and the Andersen national office. The engagements reviewed by Deloitte & Touche and Andersen involved about 45% of Andersen's U.S. audit partners. 
Andersen said the engagements selected for review represented a cross-section of Andersen's accounting and auditing practice, with emphasis on higher-risk engagements. It included examining working paper files and reports, and interviewing engagement personnel.

Enron auditor says it's clean ; Andersen cites review by rival
Delroy Alexander, Tribune staff reporter

(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)

Accounting firm Andersen said Wednesday that its auditing practice responsible for checking the books of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. has been given a clean bill of health in a peer review by another accounting firm, but some observers criticized the findings. 
The review, performed by rival Big Five firm Deloitte & Touche, was part of an assessment carried out once every three years to check the quality of financial reporting of top firms.
Andersen's accounting systems were ""deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards,"" according to a statement from the Chicago-based firm. ""Deloitte's opinion was unmodified, without qualification,"" for the year ended Aug. 31, Andersen added. 
But the integrity of the process was criticized almost immediately by analysts, including professor Lynn Turner, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountant and current director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University. 
""If the process was really credible, I don't think we'd be having the rash of problems we are having today,"" Turner said. 
Turner cited reporting problems that have cost investors billions of dollars at Enron, such other Andersen clients as Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., and similar high-profile failures at Cendant Corp., Rite Aid Corp. and MicroStrategy Inc. after audits by other accounting firms. 
Critics of the peer review process point to the fact that since the cooperative assessments began in 1978, no Big Five accounting firm has received a qualified opinion of its accounting procedures from a rival. 
When Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, it was Andersen's Houston office's largest client. The energy trader's collapse is the subject of a SEC investigation, lawsuits and a number of congressional probes. 
According to Deloitte's letter of comment, which accompanied the unqualified opinion, Andersen was told about a need to improve minor documentation and communication problems. 
Andersen's peer review was all but complete when it asked in November for the review to be expanded to include the Houston office responsible for auditing Enron, which had disclosed financial reporting problems that led to $1.2 billion being chopped from shareholders' equity. 
The assessment did not look specifically at the audit Andersen performed on Enron, because there is ""pending litigation"" over reporting problems, according to Deloitte's letter.

Mirant exits deal with Enron, Edison
by Danny Fortson in San Francisco

01/03/2002
The Daily Deal
Copyright (c) 2002 The Deal LLC

With the energy industry reeling since Enron filed for bankruptcy last month, Mirant is one of several companies whose credit ratings have been slashed because of concerns of overly aggressive growth plans and highly leveraged positions. 
Mirant Corp. has ended a proposed $1.3 billion purchase of a power plant from Enron Corp. and Edison International.
The move is just one piece of a sweeping budget overhaul the company announced Dec. 20, a day after Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's credit rating to ""junk"" status. 
""We expected that Mirant would not close on this deal,"" said Ellen Lapson, an analyst with credit rating agency Fitch Ibca, Duff and Phelps that last month put the company on ratings watch. ""The question is whether their termination will stick."" 
Mirant agreed July 31 to buy EcoElectrica Holdings Ltd., a liquefied natural gas-fired power plant in Peneuelas, Puerto Rico, for $586 million in cash and $700 million in debt. Enron Asset Holdings, an Enron subsidiary that is not part of the energy company's bankruptcy, owns 47.5% of the plant, and Edison Mission Energy, a unit of Edison International, owns 50%. 
Rosemead, Calif.-based Edison, which has flirted with bankruptcy, said in a statement Dec. 31 that it ""does not agree that Mirant has the right to terminate the agreement and is reviewing its alternatives."" An Edison spokesman decline comment on whether the company planned to mount a legal challenge. 
""We don't agree that Mirant has the right to terminate the agreement, and accordingly we're evaluating our options,"" Enron spokesman John Ambler said. 
Mirant initially disclosed its intent to terminate the deal in a Dec. 20 press release detailing its effort to beef up its balance sheet. In the statement, the Atlanta power producer said it foresaw ""no closing of Eco Electrica in 2001 due to non-satisfaction of closing conditions."" 
""Under the purchase agreement, if the transaction does not close on or before Dec. 31, 2001, then the purchase agreement is cancelable by any party,"" Mirant announced in a Dec. 26 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
""If, as we expect, the transaction does not close before year-end, we will reevaluate the desirability of the transaction based on the then-current circumstances."" 
With the energy industry reeling since Enron filed for bankruptcy last month, Mirant is one of a number of power companies whose credit ratings have been slashed because of concerns over overly aggressive growth plans and highly leveraged positions. Dynegy Inc. of Houston and Calpine Corp. of San Jose, Calif., for example, also have suffered credit downgrades. 
Lapson applauded Mirant's move to bail out of the deal, saying it will help ""bring their resources into balance with the current market situation."" 
Other cost-cutting moves under way at the company include a 40%, or $1.5 billion, reduction in the company's capital budget, a common equity offering that raised $759 million, and asset sales. 
Though Fitch has said it is not worried about the company's near-term liquidity, it is scrutinizing Mirant's credit rating. 
Significant to the company's recovery is Mirant's pending $1.63 billion sale of its 44% ownership stake in Berlin utility Bewag AG to Swedish state-owned electricity company Vattenfall AB, which announced in early December. 
But additional assets sale may prove difficult. That's because Enron's bankruptcy has forced the former energy giant to put its power assets up for sale, undercutting efforts by Mirant and other companies trying to unload plants and pipelines. 
Meanwhile, the stock price and market capitalization of many would-be buyers have sunk in Enron's wake, diminishing the pool of bidders. 
That means companies such as Mirant face not only lower prices for their properties, but also a scarcity of financing for prospective acquirers. Sinking power prices have further undermined the value of certain Mirant's assets, Lapson said. 
Separately, Mirant on Wednesday sold its Empresa Electrica del Norte Grande SA plant in Chile, which had about $340 million in debt, to F.S. Inversiones Ltda. for $4.5 million.

Back in the late 1960s, during my undergraduate years at the University of Notre Dame, I was in awe of a fellow in the class ahead of mine. He seemed to have read every book there was and he always got top grades. But most impressive was the way he talked: Ask him a five-second question and he could discourse for an hour. 
I must confess I often didn't understand what he was communicating, but it sure was impressive the way he did it.
We finally ended up in a class together. It was an English seminar, taught by Father Charlie Sheedy, who was dean of the College of Arts and Letters at the time and whose name now graces that college's highest teaching award. 
One day well into the semester I stayed after class to talk with Father Sheedy. As I stood in front of him, he looked distractedly toward me over the top of his glasses, shook his head and muttered, more to himself than to me, ""That guy [he named the fellow who awed me], he gets started talking and I don't understand what he's talking about."" 
I thought of that the other day as I was reading an article in Fortune magazine about the collapse of Enron, the Houston-based energy-trading company. Or is it a pipeline operator? Or maybe something else altogether? 
That was 90 percent of the problem at Enron: As the company flew higher and higher, nobody on the outside and very few on the inside could figure out exactly what was keeping it aloft, how it was making the money it allegedly was making. 
The other half, as Yogi Berra would say, is that nobody asked tough questions. There weren't enough Charlie Sheedys around to ask, in his disarmingly gentle but persistent-as-a-yelping-terrier fashion, ""What the heck do you mean by that?"" 
The guys at the top of Enron promised to spin straw into gold, to outfit their shareholders like emperors in exquisite new garments. For a time they seemed to do just that. And nobody, apparently, asked how. 
The Fortune article suggests that was at least in part ""because Enron delivered what the Street [Wall Street] most cared about: smoothly growing earnings."" 
I suspect there was another reason at least as important: People just didn't want to admit they didn't understand what these financial alchemists were up to. They didn't want to mark themselves as ignorant, unhip, not with it. 
Truth is, however, that for all our affluence and despite the growth over the last quarter century in 401(k)'s and Individual Retirement Accounts and investments in the stock market, Americans remain astonishingly ignorant of how business and investing work. 
Not without reason has the brokerage firm Merrill Lynch recently undertaken an advertising campaign with comedian-actor-writer Steve Martin describing his personal bewilderment about investments and how the firm has helped him. (Full disclosure: I am a Merrill Lynch client also.) 
Given the size of the American economy, it's a wonder that Enron- type fiascoes don't happen more often than they do. But when they do- -Long-Term Capital Management, Sunbeam, Cendant--they always seem to happen the same way: Some fellow comes along with a whole new way of making money, foolproof and scientific, and all that's needed for the method to work is to suspend disbelief. 
We used to think such confidence schemes were for the little folk- -the unlucky old lady who met a kindly stranger on the street and was persuaded against all reason to turn over all of her life's savings to him. 
- - - 
But all of economics and business ultimately are about confidence. It can be well- or poorly placed. In the case of Enron, it looks to have been utterly misplaced. 
Is it just me or is everybody's e-mail inbox being flooded these days with ads for pornography? And is it just me or has everybody noticed that they've grown increasingly smutty and perverted and violent? 
Teenagers seem to be the current hot-selling item. Teens of every kind in every kind of attitude and with every kind of creature. 
I'm no prude and I am, as a matter of principle, in favor of as wide-open and unfettered an Internet as possible. But two to three dozen separate slices of this pornographic spam daily is about to turn me into an advocate of some sort of regulation.

Hoping It's No California, Texas Deregulates Energy
By JIM YARDLEY

01/03/2002
The New York Times
Page 18, Column 5
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 2 -- Less than a year after the nation's most-populous state, California, endured blackouts and political and economic turmoil when it deregulated the power industry, the second-most-populous state, Texas, this week began its own deregulation plan with officials promising that there would be no reprise of California's chaos. 
But consumer advocates, while generally agreeing that the Texas plan included better safeguards than California's, expressed skepticism that residential customers would benefit from long-term reductions as energy providers competed for business. These advocates also warned that Texas, like California, failed to provide adequate protection to ensure that the state did not suffer from electricity shortages as demand increased.
For Texas, deregulation comes not long after the Enron Corporation, the Houston energy giant that championed deregulated energy markets, collapsed into bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the chairman of the state agency that will oversee the deregulated electricity market, has come under fire for his ties to Enron. 
The official start of deregulation in Texas was New Year's Day, but today was the first business day of operation and, as yet, few of the 4.7 million eligible households had chosen to switch providers away from the longstanding utilities. State officials predicted that the transition would be gradual, particularly for residential customers, many of whom are still unaware that change is afoot. Nor have electricity retailers rushed into the residential market; as yet, 41 new retailers have registered, but most are seeking commercial and industrial clients. 
Terry Hadley, spokesman for the Texas Public Utility Commission, the agency overseeing the electricity marketplace, said electricity retailers were ''sharpening their pencils to see what kind of offers they can make.'' Several companies are already marketing to residential customers. and Mr. Hadley predicted that such appeals would intensify in coming months. 
Still uncertain is whether Texas customers will embrace deregulation, particularly after the problems in California. The rules here establish an immediate retail price reduction of 11 percent to 17 percent, a drop partly attributable to the low price of natural gas, which is often used to fuel electric generation plants. This savings is built into the ''price to beat,'' the state-mandated price per kilowatt hour that the old utilities will be allowed to charge under deregulation to keep their customers. New retailers will be allowed to offer lower prices as a way to entice customers to switch. 
Texas officials have taken pains to reassure consumers -- and journalists -- that California's problems were unique. 
In California, the state deregulated the wholesale power market while keeping retail prices capped. This caused the state's two biggest public utilities to lose billions of dollars when wholesale prices spiked and the retail price caps prevented them from passing the costs along to consumers. One reason the prices jumped was the price of natural gas, then at a record high. 
California officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, also accused several energy companies, including Enron, of manipulating prices and making the state's problems worse, a charge the companies denied. 
California's problems were also partly attributable to a lack of supply; the state had not built a major power plant in roughly a decade. 
The state endured rolling blackouts and other problems before federal regulators ordered restraints on electricity prices last summer. In September, the California Public Utilities Commission voted to shift away from deregulation. 
While about two dozen states, including most of those in the Northeast, have begun deregulation, others, like Nevada, New Mexico and Oklahoma have postponed plans in the wake of California's problems. Texas officials, on the other hand, express confidence in their plan. 
Unlike California, Texas deregulated the wholesale electrical market in 1995, providing a time buffer to work out any kinks before introducing retail deregulation this year. And also unlike California, Texas has seen about 30 power plants built in the state in the last six years. Officials say the state's electrical supply exceeds demand by 23 percent. 
Nor does the state's plan mandate the sort of retail price caps that crippled the California utilities. 
''We have more than enough capacity and supply of electricity,'' Mr. Hadley said. ''And the mechanics are in place to make adjustments for any dramatic spike in fuel costs.'' 
Consumer advocates are skeptical. Carol Biedrzycki, executive director of Texas Ratepayers Organization to Save Energy, said the state should have required electricity providers to maintain a ''reserve margin'' of electrical capacity of roughly 15 percent above demand. Ms. Biedrzycki said she believed that state officials had inflated power-generating capacity and could face problems of increasing demand in a few years. 
''In order to keep the prices stable, we have to have a reserve margin,'' she said. 
The Texas Public Utility Commission has been in the spotlight recently because of questions of whether its chairman, Max Yzaguirre, a former Enron executive appointed by Gov. Rick Perry, misrepresented his connections to the company on state disclosure forms. Last month, as Enron was in the midst of bankruptcy and laying off more than 4,000 employees, Mr. Yzaguirre revised his disclosure forms to expand the list of Enron-related companies to which he had been connected. 
Initially, he had listed his position with Enron's affiliate in Mexico. But his revised listing showed his membership on the board of the Enron North America Corporation and other related companies. Mr. Yzaguirre has attributed the omission to a simple oversight, but a spokesman for a leading Democratic candidate for governor, Tony Sanchez, questioned whether Mr. Yzaguirre had a conflict of interest. One of the new retailers seeking to enter the market, the New Power Company, is partly owned by Enron. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Hadley, the spokesman for the commission, said Enron's bankruptcy should not have an impact on deregulation in Texas. Some commercial customers had signed up with two Enron-related electricity retailers, he said, but state regulators are making certain that those customers can be switched to other providers.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron collapse turns focus on pension rules.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron collapse turns focus on pension rules - But a change in the law looks unlikely, writes Elizabeth Wine. 
The collapse of Enron, the energy trader, highlighted an uncomfortable fact about some US company retirement plans: workers at many of the largest companies have a dangerously high exposure to their employer because large chunks of their retirement plans are invested in the company's own stock.
In spite of calls for regulations to end such risky concentration and a bill introduced to Congress to cap company stock in retirement plans, industry watchers and congressional insiders say new rules are unlikely to emerge. 
About 60 per cent of Enron's $2.1bn retirement plan was in Enron stock and the fund was devastated by the share price plunge from a high of $80 last year to less than $1. 
Such a high concentration is par for the course among large US companies. According to a study of 219 of the largest defined contribution retirement plans, 45 of them - 20 per cent - have more than half their portfolios invested in company stock. 
The survey, by the Institute of Management and Administration, a business publisher, shows 25 plans have more than 60 per cent allocated to company shares. 
US companies receive generous tax breaks for matching employees' contributions to retirement plans and using shares makes contributions cheaper. The practice also settles a large block of shares with sympathetic owners, providing ballast in choppy markets. 
In December, the Democratic US Senators Barbara Boxer of California and Jon Corzine of New Jersey proposed legislation that would cap employer stock in such funds, called 401(k) plans, at 20 per cent. 
However, pension industry participants say the situation is not serious enough to really provoke change. Thousands of Enron employees were left with no nest egg, but it was just one company and there is no reason to believe that the off-balance-sheet deals that caused its demise are systemic. 
Part of the reason for the reluctance to enact laws, even in the face of public outrage, is the pro-business, anti-regulatory bent of a majority Republican Congress. Congress has created and reinforced that culture, by passing the tax breaks and other incentives, for the past 40 years. 
Dallas Salisbury, head of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a pension policy group in Washington, notes that the defined contribution plans were designed to help workers retire with company stock - not to provide a diversified investment portfolio for retirement. 
Mr Salisbury suggests attempts to regulate the amount of company stock in defined contribution plans would hurt the very employees that policy-makers seek to help. Companies faced with a strict curtailment of their ability to contribute company stock would probably opt to halt contributions, he says. 
He may be right. Ford Motor for one has recently suspended its practice of contributing 60 cents for every $1 its workers contribute to their retirement fund. 
Sources close to Senator Corzine's office say he is considering another solution. Lawmakers could eliminate a clause in the 1974 retirement plan legislation that exempts companies from having to follow the principles of diversification when it comes to their own stock. 
""If that exemption were repealed, it would have the same effect as a cap,"" said Eli Gottesdiener, an attorney leading one of four employee lawsuits against Enron. 
However, without a cap, there would still be a grey area to allow companies to interpret ""prudent diversification"" as they wish.

Horrible Year Ends on Up Note At Cantor
Financial Health for the Firm And More Smiles for the Staff
By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

01/03/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 4
c. 2002 New York Times Company

As Howard W. Lutnick, the chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald, headed to Florida last weekend to see out the worst year of his life, he found himself, beyond all expectations, with good news to share. 
''I have told my families'' -- as Mr. Lutnick affectionately calls the survivors of the colleagues he lost on Sept. 11 -- ''that Cantor will be profitable in the fourth quarter,'' he said. With a faint trace of his old swagger, he added: ''We will be highly profitable -- not barely profitable, but highly profitable.''
The achievement would have been merely satisfying for the Wall Street bond-trading firm in a normal year. But ''normal'' and ''Cantor'' parted company on the day the terrorist attacks destroyed the firm's headquarters at the top of the World Trade Center and killed 658 of the 960 people working there, including Mr. Lutnick's brother, Gary. Since then, simply surviving might have been news enough for Cantor, which has promised 25 percent of any future profits to the families of those who were lost. Instead, Mr. Lutnick said in an interview, Cantor ended 2001 profitable enough to pay for the first of 10 years of promised health insurance for the families, with cash left over to distribute in mid-February as the first installment on a $100,000 minimum gift pledged to each family. 
The company bank accounts have been easier to repair than the people. Mr. Lutnick says he thinks of each surviving employee as ''a miracle.'' Nevertheless, there have been layoffs as the company has pulled out of weak businesses, and those have been more than usually bruising. 
In addition, some employees have been unable to go to work at all since Sept. 11 because of the emotional trauma they experienced, one executive said. ''We know that the greater impact of this will come three to six months down the road,'' this executive said. ''You have to wonder where some of these people will be then.'' 
But although all the Cantor employees still wrestle with the grief of having lost hundreds of close friends and colleagues -- one who was critically injured died not long ago, bringing fresh pain -- some say their days now include a little more laughter, a bit of optimism, a sense of having weathered the very worst of a continuing storm. 
''We smile,'' one executive said. ''We laugh. We're here together. We have a purpose.'' 
The people who have joined the firm since Sept. 11, almost exclusively in the stock-trading operations, ''have gotten a chance to get acclimated,'' said Philip Marber, the senior managing director who used to lose sleep worrying over how to recreate the well-oiled trading desk he lost. ''A little more chemistry is starting to occur. It's kind of jelling a little bit -- which is what we were hoping would happen.'' 
The surviving families seem more content with Mr. Lutnick, whose tearful televised promises to help were met with angry suspicion by early October. The company's new charity fund has distributed nearly $9 million in gifts -- Mr. Lutnick and other partners recently offered a $5 million matching grant to help the fund raise $10 million more -- and Cantor has paid roughly $45 million in promised bonuses and other benefits to the families since November. 
Mr. Lutnick is not bitter about the reaction, he said. 
''It was a moment in time,'' he said. ''They're sad it happened; I'm sad it happened. But it's past, it's over.'' 
In recent months, as he pulled out of a media spotlight that had blistered him in the weeks immediately after the attacks, he mailed 1,300 to 1,400 handwritten notes to the families of his lost employees. 
A private partnership, Cantor is not required to disclose profits. But it is also the majority owner of eSpeed, a publicly traded electronic trading network, which must keep investors informed about important trends. Here, too, Mr. Lutnick, as the chairman and chief executive, has room to boast. 
''A few weeks ago, I had the incredible pleasure of announcing that eSpeed would be profitable for the first time, in the fourth quarter of 2001,'' he said. Forecasting profit of a penny to a nickel a share, Mr. Lutnick added: ''We're not going to just make 'earnings per share,' which you can do with some accounting games, but we are going to make actual money.'' 
The eSpeed stock, suspended from Nasdaq trading for 18 days after Sept. 11, rallied after Mr. Lutnick's announcement. It closed yesterday at $8.35 a share, not far from its Sept. 10 closing price of $8.69, but nowhere near its peak of almost $83 a share in March 2000, or even its initial offering price two years ago of $22. 
''There are not many e-commerce companies left standing, let alone ones that have met their forecasts,'' Mr. Lutnick said. 
It is not possible to say how these gains will affect Mr. Lutnick's own compensation. At Cantor, he is the general managing partner of a private limited partnership, which does not disclose compensation for any of its partners, including Mr. Lutnick. At eSpeed, where his 2000 salary was $350,000 and his bonus was $650,000, his 2001 compensation has not yet been made public. 
The rebounding stock market was one important ingredient in the fourth-quarter recovery at Cantor, of course. Fortunately for Cantor, some 75 percent of the firm's top revenue producers in its stock-trading business worked outside the doomed New York office. 
Yesterday, Cantor opened an office in Shrewsbury, N.J., easing the crowding in the makeshift trading room Mr. Marber set up in Midtown Manhattan after the attacks. The new suburban office will start with 10 people, but Mr. Marber hopes it will grow to about 25 if the firm's stock-trading business continues to thrive. 
Cantor and eSpeed each carried $40 million in property insurance and $25 million in business-interruption coverage, according to Mr. Lutnick. That is expected to largely cover the property and business damage, including an estimated $32.4 million in total losses at eSpeed and additional undisclosed partnership losses at Cantor. 
But Cantor's recovering profits also benefited, perversely, from some terrible luck -- its own and that of the Enron Corporation. 
Well before the attacks, Cantor had begun to shift its core business, trading government and corporate bonds for big institutional clients, from expensive human traders to the less-expensive electronic trading system operated by eSpeed. With the sudden loss of so many of its traders, Cantor was forced overnight to shift more of its lower-margin business to eSpeed. Though eSpeed itself lost about 180 of its 477 worldwide employees, it was nevertheless able to resume operations within 48 hours of the attacks. 
''We always knew that eSpeed would be our future,'' said Joseph C. Noviello, now that company's chief information officer. ''But that future arrived instantly on Sept. 11.'' 
With that future, Cantor has stepped out of about a dozen markets where its traders were once active. ''There was too much of a human loss to go back and try to rebuild it the old way,'' Mr. Lutnick said. ''We have to be different; we have to play the hands that have been dealt to us.'' 
To be sure, eSpeed still faces stiff competition in the rapidly consolidating electronic bond-trading arena, which has shrunk by almost a third of its players over the last year, according to a tally by the Bond Market Association. But Mr. Lutnick says eSpeed is still ''the dominant system for trading U.S. Treasury securities around the country,'' and Wall Street analysts generally agree. 
In addition, eSpeed got a boost from the trouble at Enron, the giant energy company that filed for bankruptcy a month ago. Before its collapse, Enron was doing a bustling business through Enron Online, its energy trading service. After Enron failed, that trading shifted to more diverse trading networks, including TradeSpark, which is jointly owned by Cantor, eSpeed and five large energy companies including a subsidiary of the Williams Companies. 
Indeed, TradeSpark is powered by eSpeed's technology and pays eSpeed a commission on each transaction, Mr. Noviello explained. ''So that business has seen enormous growth since the fall of Enron,'' he said. 
But despite a more upbeat mood and a strong sense of having delivered on an important pledge to their lost friends' families, everyone at Cantor is ready to leave 2001 behind, employees said. 
''Last week, to top it all off, I got hit by a cab,'' Mr. Marber said. ''Right on 39th Street. A lot of bumps and bruises, nothing worse. But I remember thinking, as I picked myself up: 'Please, I just want this year to end.' ''

Deal Sense
CEO of New York City
by Jeffrey Kanige

01/03/2002
The Daily Deal
Copyright (c) 2002 The Deal LLC

Acting like a Wall Street CEO, Michael Bloomberg's first significant action as New York City mayor is to trim the budget with promised layoffs. 
Michael Bloomberg, an unlikely politician who made his name and fortune as chief executive of a media empire, took over as mayor of New York Tuesday and immediately introduced a CEO's mentality to City Hall.
Unfortunately for New Yorkers, it is an airline CEO's mentality. 
With the city poised to reap tens of billions of dollars in federal bailout funds, Bloomberg's first significant action was to announce layoffs. Mayor Mike said he would cut his own staff by 20% and urged other elected officials to do the same. Soon, small packets of heavily salted nuts will become ubiquitous on subway cars and the Broadway Local will be subject to three-hour delays due to bad weather in Boston. 
Of course, it could be worse. Bloomberg could adopt an AT&T CEO's mentality and proclaim his intention to remake the city into a national colossus by buying Camden, N.J., Savannah, Ga. and Bettendorf, Iowa for $100 billion. Then, after spending billions on new roads and bridges, a hostile takeover bid would force the mayor-CEO to sell Manhattan and Brooklyn to Philadelphia for $70 billion. With his vision shredded, Mayor Mike's only consolation would come from being named sanitation commissioner in the new city. 
Or he could adopt an Enron CEO's mentality and become a Wall Street darling by consistently producing a solid municipal balance sheet -- even though nobody is quite sure how he is accomplishing such a feat while tax revenues are shrinking. It will soon become clear, however, that the mayor-CEO has hidden the city's debt by shifting it offshore to the Long Island suburbs. As his once-trusted aides resign in disgrace and the city declares bankruptcy, Bloomberg will insist that he didn't know anything about how the government was being run. Despite the apparent absurdity of the claim, most people will believe him. 
To be fair, Bloomberg could emulate the qualities of a truly admirable CEO. In so doing, he could inspire the city's workers to greater productivity by treating them humanely and paying them decent wages. Dealing with government institutions would actually become a pleasant experience. This approach, however, would subject the mayor-CEO to merciless attacks by the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal and the city's Murdochian media outlets. 
And, to be honest, most New Yorkers probably wouldn't want such a milquetoast mayor-CEO. What they really want is a Microsoft mayor-CEO. They want a mayor who will make New York the most powerful player in the city sector. They want a city that is feared by other, obviously inferior municipalities. Newark wants the Yankees? Newark is toast. And let that be a lesson to you, Hoboken. American Express isn't leaving home. Period. 
So what if city services regularly crash for no reason? Who cares if buses made in other cities won't run on New York streets? Eventually, everyone will adapt and inter-municipal commerce will be much more efficient when every city is New York. 
Now that's a mentality with which New Yorkers are comfortable.

News; Domestic
Top Story: Interview With Monica Crowley and Ellis Henican
Bill O'Reilly

01/02/2002
Fox News: The O'Reilly Factor
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.
-- Excerpts Only --
BILL REILLY, HOST: I'm Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight, and a very happy New Year to you on this first edition of THE FACTOR 2002. 
There are certain things the government must get accomplished this year, and that is the subject of this evening's Talking Points memo.
Number one, the death of bin Laden. That's obvious. 
Number two, the capture and trial in front of a military tribunal of Mullah Omar. He should be charged with crimes against humanity. 
Number three, fuel conservation. OPEC has once again cut production in the face of a worldwide recession and a war on terror. These nations are not our friends. The Bush administration should embark in a serious conservation campaign using tax credits for those who save fuel and higher taxes for those who waste it. 
We have to stop fooling around here. Alternative fuels must be aggressively pursued. 
Number four, the minimum wage should be raised $1 to $6.15 an hour. 
Number five, zero percent interest loans should be made available to workers whose unemployment insurance runs out. 
Number six, the capital gains tax should be cut by 20 percent to stimulate investment in the nation's corporations. 
Number seven, tax credits should be given to corporations who hire workers and invest in their own infrastructure. Obviously, that would help the economy. 
Number eight, the U.S. military should assist the border patrol in securing the borders. This must happen for all of us to become secure, and for the flow of narcotics to diminish. 
Number nine, President Bush must order John Ashcroft to investigate the Enron situation, where executives walked away with millions while millions of everyday Americans got hosed. This cannot stand. 
And number 10, money and guns must be given to the opponents of Saddam Hussein in order to destabilize that terrorist regime. 
So there's the no spin 202 (ph) agenda for the good of all Americans. No excuses will be accepted. 
That's the memo. 
Now for the ""Top Story"" tonight, two other points of view on the year ahead. With us now are Fox News analyst Dr. Monica Crowley and Ellis Henican.
..................
(COMMERCIAL BREAK) 
O'REILLY: Continuing now with what has to happen in the year 2002, we're talking with Dr. Monica Crowley and Ellis Henican, both Fox News analysts. All right. 
This Enron situation, this is bad, this is bad. And, you know, Americans haven't been paying too much attention to it because of the war on terror and the economy, and I understand that. But you got four weasels here in Enron, four big shots, all of whom, in the space of a year, took out millions, and in one case $30 million, for themselves, all right? 
And then this thing collapses, with the help of all the idiots on the Cavuto show and CNBC and all those iddi (ph), Oh, Enron, Enron, Enron. And then boom, people lose their 401(K)s, and the people in Enron couldn't sell their own stock, they were prohibited from selling it. 
HENICAN: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) 
O'REILLY: So are you telling me that the Justice Department of the United States should not launch a criminal investigation into this? 
HENICAN: Oh, absolutely they should. But let's remember the historical context here. Enron is an organization that got a lot, a lot of support over the years from a group of Texans who are running America right now, and it shouldn't surprise you, Bill O'Reilly, that they were a little slow jumping on your train. 
O'REILLY: Well, but see, you, you're... 
CROWLEY: Well, (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
O'REILLY: ... you have this conspiratorial thing... 
HENICAN: (UNINTELLIGIBLE), I'm just saying... 
CROWLEY: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) 
O'REILLY: ... I'm going to say, I'm going to say, Look, if Ashcroft doesn't do it, then I'm going to be with you. 
HENICAN: Well, we should all do it. 
O'REILLY: But Ashcroft himself is the guy who should be out point on this, right? 
HENICAN: Well, all I'm say... 
O'REILLY: He should be the point man on this, right? 
CROWLEY: And the president... 
HENICAN: ... all I'm saying, see the, see the historical context here, as I join you in your call... 
CROWLEY: Wait a minute, no, Ellis... 
HENICAN: ... that we smash these people. 
CROWLEY: ... you're trying to make this into a political scandal... 
HENICAN: Well, it is a political scandal. 
CROWLEY: ... and not that, no, it is not that. 
HENICAN: Not yet. Not yet, but it's pretty darn close. 
CROWLEY: The president of the United States... 
HENICAN: It's darn close. 
CROWLEY: ... should order his attorney general to launch an investigation into this... 
O'REILLY: Why hasn't he done that? 
CROWLEY: ... there should also be congressional investigations... 
HENICAN: I told you why. 
CROWLEY: ... the collapse of this company was absolutely breathtaking, to go from the world's largest energy supply company, all right, trading at $85 a share, to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, trading at 30 cents a share, within the space of a few months, when all those top executives, all right? 
O'REILLY: That's right, it's outrageous. 
CROWLEY: Walked away with hundreds of millions... 
HENICAN: And you don't think... 
CROWLEY: ... of -- no... 
HENICAN: ... and you don't think Bush and Cheney... 
CROWLEY: ... but, but wait a minute... 
HENICAN: ... have been looking the other way? 
CROWLEY: ... it is -- Ellis, it is... 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: No, I don't think they care. 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: ... don't be naive. Don't be naive. 
O'REILLY: I don't think they care. I don't think they... 
(CROSSTALK) 
CROWLEY: First of all... 
O'REILLY: ... now they have to care. 
CROWLEY: First of all... 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: Now they have to care. 
(CROSSTALK) 
CROWLEY: They're not that stupid to get involved in this kind of situation, first of all. 
HENICAN: (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
CROWLEY: Number one. Number two... 
O'REILLY: They might be that stupid... 
CROWLEY: ... it is -- it is... 
(CROSSTALK) 
CROWLEY: ... no, I really don't -- after eight years of... 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: ... Texas (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
(CROSSTALK) 
CROWLEY: ... Clinton, Clinton administration... 
O'REILLY: Listen, what if that list that Cheney's hiding -- and there's no question Cheney's hiding the list... 
HENICAN: Indeed. 
O'REILLY: ... of the people that you mentioned before, the energy advisers, he's hiding the list, there's no reason why he can't put that list out. 
CROWLEY: He... 
O'REILLY: What if, at the top of that list, is Ken Lay (ph)? 
CROWLEY: Well, well, and we know... 
O'REILLY: ... which is probably there. 
(CROSSTALK) 
CROWLEY: ... we know that Ken Lay is very close to the president and Dick Cheney, and we know that he was at the White House and engaged in some of these meetings... 
O'REILLY: He's got to be investigated. 
CROWLEY: ... (UNINTELLIGIBLE) for the energy task force. 
O'REILLY: He's got to be investigated. 
CROWLEY: Of course he has to, that's why this order has to come from the president to John Ashcroft. 
HENICAN: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) 
CROWLEY: But it's illogical to suggest... 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: ... and you know why Janet Reno wouldn't? 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: ... yesterday's news... 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: Well, wait a minute, hold it, yesterday's news always applies to today's news. 
HENICAN: We're waiting still. 
O'REILLY: You got a corrupt Justice Department. We have a corrupt Justice Department. We've had a corrupt Justice Department for 10 years. Now, just because the (UNINTELLIGIBLE) general change didn't mean the culture of the department changed. It's still corrupt. 
HENICAN: Well, and new guys are in charge, and we're waiting. 
O'REILLY: All right. 
CROWLEY: Yes, but the bulk of the... 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: ... fair enough. 
CROWLEY: ... but I think, Ellis, it's illogical to suggest that Enron somehow benefited in any significant way from close ties to the White House... 
O'REILLY: Well, if they don't investigate, then they will. 
(CROSSTALK) 
CROWLEY: ... but, but, but the company would not have gone under if they had been... 
O'REILLY: Well, that's free market... 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: What else you got on your list? 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: ... I know you've been pooh-poohing this one, Bill, but I think it's still important that we do something about the dreadful way that voting goes on in this country... 
O'REILLY: All right. You know what we should do, Ellis? 
HENICAN: ... the federal government... 
O'REILLY: Here's what we should do. 
HENICAN: ... has a -- the people have a right to vote in a fair election. 
O'REILLY: I'm going to put you in charge. No, Ellis wants more, easier, whatever... 
HENICAN: One man, one vote. 
O'REILLY: ... one man vote. 
HENICAN: How about that? 
O'REILLY: I'm going to put you in charge of going to the house and driving these people who can't vote to the polls. 
HENICAN: (UNINTELLIGIBLE), all I want... 
O'REILLY: I'm putting you in charge of that. 
HENICAN: ... to say... 
O'REILLY: All right. 
HENICAN: ... is that... 
O'REILLY: Come on. 
HENICAN: ... when someone shows up at the polls, we ought to count their vote in a fair way. Why wouldn't you embrace that? That's very, very simple. 
O'REILLY: Because here's why I won't embrace it. 
HENICAN: It's very simple. 
O'REILLY: Because any moron can go in there and vote. And the morons who can't... 
HENICAN: Well... 
O'REILLY: ... I have no sympathy for them at all. 
HENICAN: ... we know that an awful lot of people that you call morons thought they voted, tried to vote, showed up to vote... 
(CROSSTALK) 
HENICAN: ... and they couldn't vote, they couldn't vote. 
(CROSSTALK) 
O'REILLY: They couldn't cut it. They couldn't do it. 
HENICAN: You can't be happy with that. 
O'REILLY: They couldn't punch the chad. So I'm putting you in charge. 
HENICAN: Bill, (UNINTELLIGIBLE) feel good. 
O'REILLY: You can take them to the... 
HENICAN: That makes you feel good. 
CROWLEY: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) Ellis... 
O'REILLY: ... and you can punch it for them, Ellis. There you go. 
HENICAN: You can't feel good... 
CROWLEY: (UNINTELLIGIBLE) smarting... 
HENICAN: ... about that. 
CROWLEY: ... that Al Gore is not sitting in the White House right now. That issue is so... 
HENICAN: I just want the winner to have won. 
CROWLEY: ... over. We're in a war... 
HENICAN: I want the winner to win. 
CROWLEY: ... (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
O'REILLY: He's never, he's never... 
HENICAN: Let the winner win. 
O'REILLY: ... going to let it go. 
CROWLEY: I think that the government should actually get serious this year and committed to rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in everal -- every federal agency and institution... 
O'REILLY: Did you set up another federal agency... 
CROWLEY: ... whatever (UNINTELLIGIBLE) -- absolutely not... 
O'REILLY: ... to do that? 
CROWLEY: ... why do we need another bureaucracy (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
O'REILLY: Who, who should do it, though? 
CROWLEY: The administration should spearhead this... 
O'REILLY: For who? 
CROWLEY: ... and the president of the United States should say, Every taxpayer dollar that comes into a federal agency or institution... 
O'REILLY: Yes. 
CROWLEY: ... should be accounted for. 
O'REILLY: But they... 
CROWLEY: You're out there every day, O'Reilly, railing against... 
O'REILLY: I am, but I'll tell you what... 
CROWLEY: ... (UNINTELLIGIBLE) lack of respect for the American taxpayer... 
O'REILLY: ... there isn't anybody set up to do that. See, the GAO doesn't do it until there's a scandal, as you know. They don't get called in until it's already out of control... 
CROWLEY: Well, maybe that's (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
O'REILLY: -the congressional committees, they're supposed to do it... 
CROWLEY: Forget about Congress, they're (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
O'REILLY: ... you've got to create...

"Poor, Poor, Pitiful KEN","Sure sounds to me that Ken is in the same shoes as the rest of us regarding the downfall of ENE.  
What do you think????????????????????????
Wouldn't you think the honorable thing would be to refuse any compensation knowing your terrible performance? 
I'm sorry! I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait!

The wording of ""If he terminates his employment within 60 days of a change of control"" sure sounds to me like someone knew what was going on to me?
I guess we should have kept in mind the 2nd definition of LAY in the dictionary is ""To put to rest""

 DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an ""excess
parachute payment,"" according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days.

Enron Considers Postponing Announcement Of New CEO

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), said to be close to choosing a successor for former Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, may decide to postpone a formal announcement of its decision until after the weekend out of respect for the death of former Vice Chairman J. Clifford Baxter, a person familiar with the matter said.
An announcement of Lay's successor had been anticipated as soon as late Friday. 
Baxter, who resigned from Enron last May, was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head early Friday morning in Sugar Land, Texas - the affluent Houston suburb where he lived. Although officials have ruled the death a suicide, an autopsy is being performed as a precaution. 
The contents of a suicide note left at the scene haven't yet been disclosed. 
Baxter's death comes just one day after the start of congressional hearings on Enron's collapse and the role of its auditor Arthur Andersen. 
Amid pressure from the bankrupt company's creditors committee, Lay resigned late Wednesday night. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Stephen Cooper is the front-runner to be named acting chief executive. 
Cooper, managing principal of consulting firm Zolfo Cooper, is an expert in corporate restructuring. He is known for his turnaround efforts at Federated Department Stores Inc. (FD) and Morrison Knudsen Corp. 
According to a source familiar with the matter, Enron would like the future chief executive to oversee the day-to-day operations and restructuring of the company, while a second person will be named chairman. The source said the chairman would be responsible for handling the more political aspects of the job.

By Kathy Chu 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--A federal judge plans to issue an order Friday afternoon demanding that Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) employees hold on to company documents. 

Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, at a Friday hearing at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, said that the court order will echo recent written directives by Enron executives to employees. 

Since the company became aware of possible investigations into its downfall, it has sent six e-mails regarding document retention to its workers, according to an  Enron lawyer. 

One of the e-mails stated that ""no company records, either in electronic or paper form, should be destroyed."" The court order comes amid allegations by three Enron workers that others in the company may have shredded documents. Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's former auditor, has admitted to destroying Enron-related paperwork. 

The Federal Bureau of Investigations has taken over the 19th and 20th floors of Enron's Houston headquarters, where some of the alleged shredding occurred, an Enron lawyer said. The agency may complete its investigation on Wednesday, according to Enron. 

Enron has removed all document-shredding machines from  the building and is separating its paper and perishable waste. 

Under the bankruptcy code, those who ""knowingly and fraudulently"" dispose of documents in a Chapter 11 case can be sentenced to a five-year prison term and can be fined. 

Friday's proceedings were part of a status conference related to 11 insurers' requests to open Enron's books to determine if forward contracts guaranteed by $2 billion in  surety bonds ever existed. 

The insurers - including Safeco Insurance Co., Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. (HIG) and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., among others - contend that their obligations under these bonds depend upon whether energy was actually delivered in contracts made among Enron, Mahonia Ltd. and Mahonia Natural Gas Ltd. - offshore entities set up by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM). 

J.P. Morgan served on Enron's official creditors' committee and is a lead lender in the company's debtor-in-possession financing.

Judge Gonzalez, at a hearing earlier this week, had asked Enron to provide the insurers with witnesses' names and the location of documents relevant to the surety-bond contracts by Feb. 1. 

He also scheduled Friday's status conference to assess Enron's document-preservation policies. The judge has postponed until late May a decision on whether Enron must open its books, saying that pending litigation in a New York  district court would likely address this request. 

J.P. Morgan on Dec. 11 filed a lawsuit against the insurers, seeking payment of $1.1 billion - including $965 million owed to the bank - under the surety bonds. 
  The lawsuit, which was first recorded in a New York state court, was later moved to a U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

Lay not likely to get severance pay
Turnaround expert could be named Friday as Enron CEO
By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 1:29 PM ET Jan. 25, 2002
HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Former Enron CEO Ken Lay isn't likely to see much if any of his hefty severance pay in the face of opposition from creditors, shareholders and employees, bankruptcy experts said Friday.
Lay, who resigned as CEO and chairman under fire late Wednesday, could be replaced with a turnaround specialist as early as Friday, a person familiar with the matter said. The Wall Street Journal reported that Stephen Cooper of the consulting firm Zolfo Cooper is the frontrunner. Cooper wasn't immediately available for comment.
Enron spokesmen weren't available for comment Friday. On Thursday, a spokesman said that Lay's compensation was still being determined.
David Bennett, an attorney representing a group of about 20 energy companies with claims against Enron, said that if anyone sought payment for an employment agreement from the bankruptcy court it would be subject to ""court scrutiny."" What's more, Lay would have to request the payment.
""There will be lots of parties lining up to question the appropriateness of paying out those kinds of funds given the circumstances,"" said Bennett, a partner with the law firm Thompson & Knight.
""For the most part, setting aside any claims the estate may have against Mr. Lay, he shouldn't be paid ahead of unsecured creditors for sure,"" Bennett added.
Rick Tilton, a bankruptcy specialist in New York, said that the creditors' committee, or a trustee if one is appointed, could assert there was cause for his dismissal. Though Lay resigned, he was asked to do so by the creditors' committee. His employment contract voids his severance if he was ""terminated with cause.""
According to an SEC proxy statement filed on March 27, 2001, Lay's contract calls for him to receive a ""lump sum payment for each full calendar year of the remaining term of the agreement equal to base salary, performance bonus, and long-term grant value received in calendar year 2000, offset against amounts payable under the severance plan maintained by Enron."" 
Lay's employment agreement, which commenced in December 1996 and runs through Dec. 31, 2003, provides for a minimum salary of $1.3 million a year. 
According to the proxy statement, Lay in 2000 was paid a $1.3 million salary and a bonus of $7 million. Taking both figures into account and doubling them translates into $16.6 million, not counting the long-term grant value. 
Also in 2000, Enron paid Lay restricted stock awards worth $7.5 million; other annual compensation, including personal benefits, worth $381,000; a $1.2 million cash payment under the Enron performance plan; and $782,830 in stock options. 
He also exercised stock options to the tune of $123.4 million in 2000. Exercisable options, which he chose not to enact, amounted to $257.5 million, while unexercisable options totaled $104.1 million. Enron also paid a $4 million, interest-bearing line of credit in full in 2000, which yielded $110,174 in interest. 
The proxy statement notes that if his severance package ""is held to constitute an 'excess parachute payment,' and Mr. Lay becomes liable for any tax penalties ... Enron will make a cash payment to him in an amount equal to the tax penalties plus an amount equal to any additional tax for which he will be liable as a result of the receipt of the payment."" 
Lay, who will remain on the company's board, will assist the board and Enron's creditors committee in selecting a ""restructuring specialist"" to help turn around the company and serve as chief executive on an interim basis. 
""What the company is looking for is a chief reorganization specialist,"" Bennett said. ""But various creditor groups are seeking the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee -- an outright bankruptcy trustee who supersedes current management. Whoever comes in, even if they're technically hired by the board, will have to quickly establish credibility with the creditors' committee.""
Enron's board plans to name a new chairman as soon as possible. Until then, the chief financial and operating officers will handle the chairmanship duties. 
Shares of Enron lost 1 cents to 44 cents in over-the-counter trading Friday.

House Enron Probe Seeks Info On Lay's Loan Transactions

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- A House panel investigating the financial collapse of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) expanded its probe Friday to include stock-related loan transactions by Kenneth Lay, who resigned this week as the company's chairman and chief executive.
Ranking members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee issued a formal request for the information in the wake of published reports that Lay had a $4 million revolving line of credit from Enron, which was raised to $7.5 million last year. 
According to the reports, Lay borrowed from the credit line 15 times between February and October of last year, and repaid the amounts in Enron stock. 
""We are concerned about the unreported nature of these transactions and their effect upon Enron shareholders and employees, particularly during the stock's steep decline in 2001,"" the lawmakers said in a letter to Lay. 
It was signed by Reps. Billy Tauzin, R-La., John Dingell, D-Mich., James Greenwood, R-Pa., and Peter Deutsch, D-Fla. 
Lay isn't required to report the details of the transactions until Feb. 14, the letter noted. The lawmakers asked for the information by Jan. 28 to assist the committee's ""intensive investigation of the demise of the company."" 
Lay is slated to testify Feb. 4 before two congressional panels, the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee. 
The letter also asked for details of similar transactions involving: Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive; Andrew Fastow, the former chief financial officer, and other senior Enron executives.

NEW YORK (AP) - The front-runner to replace Kenneth Lay as chief executive of embattled Enron Corp. is a New York bankruptcy reorganization expert whose past clients include Bradlees, Cumberland Farms and Pegasus Gold Corp., a person familiar with the situation said. 
Stephen Cooper, managing principal of the reorganization adviser Zolfo Cooper, could be named to run Enron within several days and planned to fly to Houston Friday to meet with company executives, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity and confirmed earlier published reports.
Enron spokesman Eric Thode declined to comment on Cooper or the company's progress in selecting a successor to Lay, who resigned as chairman and chief executive Wednesday night. 
Zolfo Cooper officials did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment. 
On its Web site, Zolfo Cooper says its executives ""have hands-on leadership experience under adverse conditions."" 
""Working as senior management or as part of a crisis team, we stabilize the business,"" the site says. ""Thus, we gain the necessary time to assess the situation, design, and implement programs to restore business' vitality and profitability. We maximize value by rebuilding the management process and reorganizing the business or prepare it for sale."" 
Enron's collapse began in mid-October after the company announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and a $1.2 billion reduction in the company's equity. Subsequent revelations showed that the company masked debt in questionable partnerships that benefited some company executives. 
The company - once No. 7 on the Fortune magazine list of the 500 largest companies - filed for bankruptcy protection to reorganize on Dec. 2. Last week, a judge approved a plan that allows investment bank UBS Warburg to take over the company's energy trading operation, which accounted for 90 percent of Enron's $101 billion in revenue in 2000.

If You Could Pick Someone To Run Enron, It Would Be...
By Kaja Whitehouse

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) has quickly become the Rodney Dangerfield of corporate America.
It gets no respect. 
Afterall, everyone hates the firm that collapsed in a wave of accounting scandals last November. Investors hate it because they lost a ton of money. Employees of the company hate it, because they lost their jobs and a ton of money from their pension plan. Houston hates it, because its become an embarrassment to the city Enron called home. Washington hates it so much that it decided to hold multiple Congressional hearings. 
Come to think of it, even you probably hate it. 
But apparently some Enron insiders seem to think Enron will continue to press on as long as it cleans up its act. As a first step, Kenneth Lay, center of many of probes, stepped down as Enron CEO Wednesday, saying that he wants the company to ""survive."" 
Talk has it that the Enron execs are seeking out hardcore restructuring expert Stephen F. Cooper to repair what's broke. According to the Wall Street Journal, Enron wants a leader who can manage complex daily operations and work through this troubles of bankruptcy. 
But in order to truly revive to the downtrodden company, Enron requires more than a technical fix-it man. It needs a well-known leader who can restore respectability to the Enron name - if that's possible. 
That person would have to win back the confidence of investors and Wall Street and would need to negotiate successfully with regulators and lawmakers. 
If you had the power to select anyone for this seemingly Herculian task, who would that person be? 
That's the question Dow Jones Newswires posed to people from Wall Street to Congress and the answers were an interesting mix. 
""Enron needs to have a trustworthy person that is well-known to the public,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co. ""Right now everyone feels adversely affected"" by Enron, and people want someone who will make them feel confident again, added Hogan, who voted for former television newscaster Walter Cronkite to run the downtrodden company. ""He's a sort of elder statesman, the perfect candidate,"" Hogan said. 

Mayor, Diplomat or TV Journalist? 

Some predict Enron is too rife with foul-play to regain any credibility. ""You could put Mother Teresa in there and I don't think it's ever going to bring it back,"" said Tom Salerno, partner of Squire, Sanders & Dempsey. 
But reviving companies smeared with scandal through a popular and respectable leader has worked in the past. Just look at Salomon Brothers, the debt trader that was on the brink of extinction in the early 1990s after it was discovered that the firm tried to skirt federal regulations. Instead, investment guru Warren Buffet took control and kept the company from folding under. 
Similar tactics might be necessary for Enron. If not in the CEO position, then at least in Lay's remaining role as chairman. 
No one wants to invest in that company again unless someone honest is placed at the wheel, said Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a Cleveland Democrat, who voted for Fannie Mae CEO Franklin Raines. ""It's like people telling us to get back on the plane"" after Sept. 11, she said. 
It should come as little surprise then, that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was a popular candidate among interviewees. The popular mayor gained America's favor after pulling NYC through the Sept. 11 crisis. 
Giuliani can ""turn around a bad situation and make us all feel good about it,"" said Peter Flaherty, president of the National Legal and Policy Center in Washington, DC. Many cited Giuliani's ability to handle crisis, while others touted him as a hard-working, honest individual. 
It isn't known if Giuliani is up for the post. After leaving public office this fall, the former mayor said he was setting up a consulting firm with New York accountants Ernst & Young. 
Other names that resounded with people as honest, hardworking leaders included U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, former General Electric CEO Jack Welch and Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's ice cream. 
John Challenger, CEO of outsourcing firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, in Chicago, who voted for Powell, saying that Enron requires someone with ""extraordinary diplomacy."" There are so many people who were burned by the company's fall that it will take a very diplomatic person to make everyone happy, he said. With Powell, people might walk away afterwards and say ""it wasn't what I wanted, but they will think it was fair.""

O'Neill: Not Clear Enron Tax Havens Linked To Illicit Acts

01/25/2002
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- It isn't clear if Enron Corp.'s use of Caribbean tax havens is linked to the illicit financial activities that the U.S. is seeking to crack down on through tax treaties with offshore financial havens, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said Friday. 
""It's not clear that it's related in any way to the issue of illicit financial activities,"" O'Neill told reporters when asked whether he was worried about the use of offshore subsidiaries by bankrupt energy-trading giant Enron (ENRNQ).
The New York Times, citing company papers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, reported last week that Enron paid no income taxes in four of the last five years by using hundreds of subsidiaries in tax-haven nations. 
The Senate Finance Committee has asked Enron to disclose its corporate income tax returns. 
O'Neill's remarks came after he signed a new tax-information exchange agreement with the Bahamas, a Caribbean nation that is one of 35 nations the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development cited in a June 2000 report as tax havens with harmful tax practices. 
The Bahamas is still on the OECD list, Treasury said. 
""The importance of these treaties is that they close off loopholes and windows of opportunities for illicit activities, and we are dedicated to interdicting and confiscating money that's related to terrorist financing and drug trade and other types of illicit activities,"" O'Neill said. 
O'Neill hailed the signing of the tax agreement as ""another important step forward"" in the relationship between the U.S. and the Bahamas. 
""By signing this agreement, the Bahamas leaves no doubt that it should be counted among the financial centers of the world that are committed to upholding international standards and simply will not tolerate the abuse of their financial institutions for illicit purposes,"" O'Neill said. 
Bahamian Finance Minister William Allen said the Bahamas is firmly opposed to the use of its financial system for illicit purposes and is determined that the same financial standards apply in the Bahamas as in other financial centers. 
""We are gratified by the U.S. government's recognition of the integrity of the Bahamas as a financial center,"" Allen said. 
The tax agreement with the Bahamas follows similar accords the Bush administration struck with Antigua and Barbuda and the Cayman Islands last year. 
O'Neill testified before Congress last July that the U.S. is going to seek to negotiate tax treaties with foreign jurisdictions that would require information be shared on suspected tax evaders.

U.S. signs agreement with Bahamas to crack down on tax evaders
By JEANNINE AVERSA
Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill signed an information-sharing agreement with the Bahamas Friday designed to help U.S. authorities crack down on the use of offshore tax havens to hide illegal money. 
The agreement with the Caribbean nation, long considered a haven for tax evaders, marks the Bush administration's latest effort to open up financial institutions to greater scrutiny to prevent tax evasion.
The Senate Finance Committee is investigating whether Enron Corp. used hundreds of partnerships and affiliates in tax-haven countries to mask its true financial condition. The company filed for bankruptcy in December. 
Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal tax research organization, has estimated that Enron paid no corporate income taxes in four of the past five years. Enron paid $17 million in taxes in 1997 and got refunds totaling $381 million in all other years between 1996 to 2000, according to the group's analysis. 
Asked whether he was concerned about Enron's use of offshore tax havens, O'Neill responded: ""It's not clear that it's related in any way to the issue of illicit financial activities."" 
The administration has signed information-sharing agreements with Antigua and Barbuda, and the Cayman Islands, countries also long considered tax havens. 
""The importance of these treaties is that they close off loopholes and windows of opportunity for illicit activities,"" O'Neill said. 
Friday's agreement is designed to allow the Internal Revenue Service to pierce the secrecy of accounts at financial institutions in the Bahamas, paving the way for audits that could uncover tax evasion or money-laundering activities. 
William Allen, the Bahamas finance minister, said he was pleased that the United States and his country were able to reach a ""balanced"" information-sharing agreement 
""The Bahamas is firmly against the use of its financial system for illicit purposes,"" he said. 
Senators last year heard testimony that the United States loses an estimated $70 billion in tax revenue each year because assets are concealed in offshore tax havens. 
Led by O'Neill, the Bush administration has shifted the U.S. focus in dealing with tax haven countries away from international efforts to overhaul tax structures toward negotiated agreements that allow easier U.S. pursuit of suspected cheaters. 
The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has identified various nations, including the Bahamas, as tax havens and O'Neill has pledged to negotiate within a year agreements with nations covering at least half of the offshore bank accounts. 
Previous administrations had strongly supported the OECD's efforts to curb the use of offshore accounts to evade taxes, but O'Neill and congressional Republicans have complained that the OECD approach was an attempt to punish countries with low taxes.

Enron Judge Says He Will Bar Destruction of Documents, E-Mails
2002-01-25 13:31 (New York)

     New York, Jan. 25 (Bloomberg) -- A federal bankruptcy judge said he will issue an order today barring Enron Corp. from destroying any more documents. The order also will cover e-mails and other records.
     The order by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez was sought by property insurers and backed by Enron creditors. Enron filed for bankruptcy protection last month, in the largest Chapter 11 filing ever. Allegations of document destruction have been raised this week at congressional hearings.
     Enron shares fell less than a cent to 44.5 cents in afternoon trading.

US To Review Enron, Arthur Anderson Federal Contracts

01/25/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON (AP)--The White House on Friday ordered a review of $70 million worth of federal contracts with Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) and the Arthur Andersen (X.AND) accounting firm to determine whether the embattled companies are worthy of government business. 
In a letter to the General Services Administration, which oversees government contracts, budget director Mitchell E. Daniels said charges of document shredding, manipulative accounting practices and other activities ""could reflect poorly"" on the companies and their ability to meet government ethics standards.
""These agencies should ensure that existing contracts with Arthur Andersen and Enron are being performed in accordance with contract terms and proper business practices,"" Daniels wrote. 
Enron, a Texas-based company with deep ties to President George W. Bush, filed for bankruptcy late last year after investors and workers lost fortunes in company stocks. Bush, a friend of former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, ordered a review of the nation's pension laws and approved a Justice Department criminal investigation into the company's actions. 
Arthur Andersen, which kept the company's books, is also under investigation. Congress is holding hearings on the Enron collapse. 
Daniels' letter does not say how many federal agencies have contracts with the firms, but an aide said Enron and Arthur Andersen hold $70 million worth of federal contracts. 
""Recent reports have highlighted potential irregularities in work done by the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen LLP and the Enron Corp. Some of these allegations are serious in nature,"" Daniels wrote. 
He said federal rules require firms seeking or doing business with the government to have ""a satisfactory record of business ethics and integrity."" The federal agencies were asked to determine whether Enron and Arthur Andersen still met that standard. 
The agencies were given a summary of contracts awarded to the firms. 
Enron and Arthur Andersen, both of which were given copies of Daniels' letter, had no immediate comment. 
In a somber development elsewhere on Friday, a former Enron executive was found shot to death in a car in a suburb of Houston - an apparent suicide, police said. 
The executive, 43-year-old J. Clifford Baxter, had challenged the company's questionable financial practices and resigned last May. He was mentioned by name in a warning about hidden losses that Enron executive Sherron Watkins wrote last August to company Chairman Kenneth Lay. 
Meanwhile, a separate auditor's memo from last October shows that some officials at Arthur Andersen were worried about a ""heightened risk"" of fraud in Enron's books a week before the energy company shocked stockholders with huge losses. 
The e-mail by Andersen auditor Mark Zajac warned that a computer analysis of Enron's financial activities in the third quarter of last year indicated ""a red alert: a heightened risk of financial statement fraud,"" according to investigators. 
The Andersen auditor's October e-mail warning of possible fraud, released by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., added to mounting evidence that Enron's outside accounting firm had strong misgivings about Enron business practices. 
""We have considerable rascality,"" Dingell, ranking Democrat on the House Commerce Committee, summed up Friday on CBS' ""The Early Show."" ""We have to find out who is at fault for what."" 
A House hearing Thursday into the Enron collapse left lawmakers certain of only one thing: Thousands of documents were destroyed by Enron's blue-ribbon accounting firm. 
Questions about who ordered the shredding, and whether it was intended to stifle government investigations, were left unresolved after a House panel concluded its first public hearing into the largest and perhaps most devastating bankruptcy in history. 
A week after the ""red alert"" memo, Enron reported a $638 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, partly because of hidden debt built up by a complex web of partnerships. 
On the same day that Zajac wrote his memo to the head of the Enron auditing team, Andersen also hired a law firm in anticipation of possible lawsuits involving Enron, the Houston-based energy giant that spiraled into bankruptcy Dec. 2. 
Andersen played down the significance of the computer analysis. And Zajac in the memo acknowledged the system produces ""false alarms."" 
Enron and its employees contributed more than $500,000 to the Bush campaign last year. Kenneth Lay, who this week resigned as Enron chairman, has been one of Bush's strongest supporters over the years. Andersen gave Bush $146,000 during the past three years, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.

Enron Partnership Investors Sought in House Probe
2002-01-25 15:03 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 25 (Bloomberg) - Congressional investigators examining the collapse of Enron Corp., armed with subpoenas, are looking for investors who put money into partnerships that the bankrupt energy trader used to inflate earnings and hide debt.
     The partners, many of whom have never been named, may include Wall Street firms, institutional investors and pension funds, securities lawyers and investors said. Enron lured them with promised returns of 100 percent or more, one pension fund manager said. Enron needed partners to satisfy accounting rules that allowed the company to shift assets and liabilities from its balance sheet.
     ``It sounds like they were renting the (investors') names so they could keep this off their books,'' said Larry Soderquist, director of Vanderbilt Law School's Corporate Securities Law Institute.
     Through court documents or their own spokespeople, institutions identified as investors in the partnerships include General Electric Co.'s GE Capital; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce; and state retirement systems in Arkansas and California.
     Citigroup Inc. units Citicorp and Travelers Insurance Co. made total equity investment of more than $10 million in one of the investment partnerships, LJM2, a person familiar with the matter said.
     Court documents also identified the Citigroup investment as well as an investment partnership affiliated with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and American International Group Inc.'s American Home Assurance Co. as investors, the New York Times reported.

Records Requested

      Senator Joseph Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, said the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee's Permanent Investigations Subcommittee has subpoenaed documents related to the financing of Enron's partnerships.
     ``One of its focuses is going to be on the use of insider trading of separate entities that were dealing with one another without any understanding by the public that it was happening,'' he said.
     Representative Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said yesterday investigators have requested partnership records from Enron in an effort to identify investors. He spoke at a hearing at which executives of Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, testified about the firm's destruction of Enron audit documents.
     ``There obviously are many members of Congress who would like to know who these secret partners were,'' said committee member Henry Waxman, a California Democrat.
     Wall Street firms could be a target of a congressional inquiry, said Republican Representative Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania.
     ``Well if that's where our investigation leads us we certainly will,'' Greenwood said. ``We will leave no stone unturned.''

Enron Assets

     An Andersen internal memo released by the committee refers to CIBC, Canada's third-largest bank, as an investor in LJM2, a partnership set up and run by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. LJM2, which eventually raised $349 million, was used to hold or sell a number of Houston-based Enron's assets, including fiber-optic cable that it bought at a premium from Enron in June 2000 and resold six months later to another Fastow-controlled partnership.
     LJM1 and LJM2 were incorporated in the Cayman Islands.
     The investment banking arm of Merrill Lynch & Co. underwrote the LJM2 offering and was made aware of information concerning Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships, according to the New York Times. In 2000, potential investors were told that Enron, through its partnerships, controlled 50 percent more assets than it disclosed in Securities and Exchange Commission filings, the paper reported.
     The Arkansas Teacher Retirement System invested $5 million in LJM2 starting in 1999, Chief Financial Officer George Snyder said. The pension fund hasn't been contacted by congressional investigators, he said.

`Good Investment'

     ``The board at the time felt it was a good investment,'' said Snyder, who didn't work for the fund at the time.
     LJM2 was sold as a vehicle for purchasing and building companies, Bill Shirer, a fund manager for the Arkansas system, said in October.
     ``We had a limited investment of less than $5 million in LJM2,'' said GE Capital spokesman Peter Stack. ``It was some type of drawdown and I don't think we got up to the $5 million cap.''
     AIG spokesman Ned Burke, CIBC spokesman Rob McLeod and Morgan Stanley spokesman Bret Gallaway all declined to comment. Citigroup spokesman Richard Howe had no immediate comment.

Dozens of Partnerships

     Enron used dozens of partnerships to hold assets such as power plants. Accounting rules allowed the company to keep partnership debt off its books if an independent investor provided at least 3 percent of partnership funding. The hidden debt grew to billions of dollars, helping Enron meet 20 percent annual earnings growth forecasts.
     ``They had to do more off-balance-sheet financings, to get the debt off the books, to present the right balance sheet that Wall Street wanted to see,'' said Danny Bowers, chief investment officer for the Houston Firefighters Relief and Retirement Fund, which manages about $1.7 billion and represents 5,000 firefighters and retirees in Houston.
     In September 2000, an Enron trust called Osprey Trust raised $2.4 billion from institutional investors such as Putnam Investments, American Express Co., the Vanguard Group, Travelers and Prudential in a private placement of notes due in 2003 to help finance some of its partnerships, according to the New York Times.
     Because the notes were backed by Enron shares, they probably have lost 60 percent of their value, the newspaper said, citing estimates by McCullough Research, a Portland, Oregon-based utility consultant.
     Bowers said Fastow approached him about investing in LJM2 in January 2000. At the time, Fastow wanted to raise $400 million to buy and sell Enron assets, Bowers said. Bowers declined because of Fastow's dual role as Enron's CFO and LJM2's general partner.

`Blatant Conflict'

     ``There was a pretty blatant conflict of interest,'' he said. ``It was kind of a stinky deal.''
     Fastow, through a spokesman, has declined to comment since being ousted from Enron in October.
     In exchange for the investment, Fastow promised ``in the neighborhood of 100 percent, 150 percent returns,'' Bowers said.
``He didn't present it as no risk, he just presented it as a very high return opportunity.''
     Enron executives tried unsuccessfully to get the University of Texas endowment to invest in about a dozen partnerships and other entities over a three-year period in the late 1990s, coming by to pitch transactions as often as every other month, said Austin Long, who was in charge of private equity investments at the university at the time.

`Incredibly Favorable'

     ``These deals had one thing in common: they were incredibly favorable to Enron and they were incredibly overreaching,'' he said. In one case, Enron was trying to raise $200 million for a retail energy startup, valuing it at $2 billion even though it had no revenue and wasn't legally registered in any state.
     Many banks and investors who dealt with Enron have declined to comment on whether they invested in partnerships. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the second-biggest U.S. bank, wrote off $456 million in trading losses and loans to Enron in the fourth quarter. It still has exposure to potential losses of $2.06 billion. J.P. Morgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau declined to comment on whether any of those losses were related to partnership investments.
     Bank of America Corp., the third-largest U.S. bank, Wachovia Corp., and SunTrust Banks Inc. have written off Enron-related loans. None would comment on whether they invested in Enron partnerships.

Calpers

     The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund, invested in Enron partnerships dating to 1993, when the company was trying to finance an expansion into energy trading. Calpers invested $250.5 million in Joint Energy Development Investments, or JEDI, which bought stakes in independent natural gas producers.
     In 1998, Enron approached Calpers about buying into a second JEDI partnership. Calpers agreed on the condition that Enron repurchase its interest in the first JEDI partnership. To do that, Enron set up Chewco Investments LP to buy Calpers' stake for $383 million. The transaction resulted in a $133 million profit for Calpers, spokesman Brad Pacheco said. The fund has received $171 million from JEDI II, he said.
     Because Enron controlled both Chewco and JEDI II, it lacked the independent funding needed to keep the partnerships and their debt off the company's balance sheet.

Restated Earnings

     In November, Enron restated earnings to 1997, lowering profit by $586 million and adding $2.6 billion in Chewco debt to the company's books, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
     Calpers spokeswoman Patricia Macht said the fund was unaware of Enron's Chewco arrangement.
     ``When Calpers cashed out of JEDI I, the investment managers believed that the cash was coming from Enron,'' she said. ``The first we heard about Chewco was in the newspaper. To this day, we have no evidence that shows there was anything improper about JEDI I and JEDI II.''
     The earnings restatement marked the beginning of Enron's demise. On Dec. 2, the company filed the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy ever.
     ``Based on the investigation so far, it's clear to us that these off-the-balance sheet partnerships eventually contributed to the company's financial meltdown,'' said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the House commerce committee.
     The committee is one of 10 in Congress investigating Enron's collapse. The SEC and the Justice Department have begun their own probes. Investigators said they want to determine who invested in the Enron partnerships and for what reason.
     ``I think we have to understand who were the investors, why, who sold the investments in the partnerships, what were the gains to understand, was there activity here you could call bilking?'' said Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who leads the Senate Consumer Affairs Subcommittee, which also is investigating Enron.

Fedl Judge Gives Enron 60 Days To Decide On Commodities
By Kathy Chu

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal judge will give bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) 60 days, or until April 2, to decide whether it wants to commit to five commodities contracts.
""Forcing an early decision to accept or reject could result in a loss of value to the estate,"" said Judge Arthur Gonzalez, during a Friday hearing at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York. 
With this ruling, the judge rejected motions by Enron's creditors - Natural Gas Pipeline of America, Trailblazer Pipeline Co., Southern California Gas Co., San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and Superior Industries International Inc. (SUP) - aimed at forcing the company to immediately decide upon the agreements. 
The creditors claim that since Enron's bankruptcy, the company hasn't fully honored its commitments. This has required third parties to step in to supply natural gas and electricity. 
But Judge Gonzalez told creditors Friday that their businesses haven't been significantly impaired by Enron's bankruptcy, as sufficient supplies of gas and electricity continue to be available. 
Also, Enron has said that its supply of the commodities to two California public utilities - Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. - as well as other creditors are nearing 100% of levels prior to the Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing.

Ill. Regulators Likely To Strip Enron Energy-Sale Rights
By Jon Kamp

01/25/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

(This article was originally published Thursday.)
CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--The Illinois Commerce Commission will likely vote next week to revoke an Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) unit's permission to sell energy to end users in the state, a spokeswoman for the commission said Thursday. 
The unit, Enron Energy Services, continues to operate and is still managing the energy needs of hundreds of industrial and commercial customers around the country despite having joined its parent in bankruptcy court. But the Dec. 2 Chapter 11 filing sets the unit at odds with Illinois law, which requires providers like Enron to have solid financial standing before serving customers. 
""It's being revoked primarily because their financial rating has been downgraded,"" commission spokeswoman Beth Bosch said of Enron Energy Service's license to do business in Illinois. ""They lost one of the legs of their stool."" 
The commission punted the expected ruling Thursday, but is likely to follow a staff recommendation to cancel Enron Energy Services' retail-provider certificate when it picks up the issue again next Tuesday, Bosch said. 
If the commission issues the order to revoke Enron Energy Services' certificate, the company will have an undefined period of time to show why it believes its certificate should remain intact, Bosch said. The company could also voluntarily back out of the certificate and could reapply for a new certificate at a later date. 
It wasn't immediately clear what effect revocation of the certificate would have on Enron Energy Services' Illinois operations. In some cases, the unit supplies energy; in others, it acts as a billing agent. While the former activity requires the certificate, the latter falls into a gray area. 
Most Enron contracts in Chicago were for energy management or billing agent services, Bosch said. But some of those contracts might have evolved into electricity provider deals. In its eight-year contract signed with the City of Chicago last summer, for example, Enron was to provide management services for the first few years and then actual electricity for the remainder of the deal. 
Representatives of Enron Energy Services couldn't be reached for comment. 
Enron Energy Services in recent years signed many high-profile contracts in the Chicago area, with customers ranging from the City of Chicago itself to PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) unit Quaker Oats Co. Under the contracts, which often run for several years, Enron Energy Services usually serves as an energy manager for its Illinois customers by helping them arrange power deals with their local utility, Bosch said. 
But the Enron unit's scope of operations has shrunk, notably in the Chicago area, where it once had aggressive growth plans. A New York bankruptcy court judge approved in early January Enron's request to terminate 600 to 700 energy supply contracts. Enron was granted a request to terminate more than 50 Chicago-area deals, Crain's Chicago Business has reported. 
The University of Chicago decided to cancel its seven-year Enron deal last week and is now receiving service directly from Exelon Corp. (EXC) unit Commonwealth Edison Co., spokesman Larry Arbeiter said. The university has no immediate plants to seek another provider. 
""At the moment the price we're paying is lower with ComEd,"" Arbeiter said. 
Quaker spokesman Mark Dollins said the company backed out of its 10-year energy management contract with Enron Energy Services, signed in February last year, after the bankruptcy judge ruled they could leave earlier this month. 
""We have already secured other providers,"" Dollins said. 
The City of Chicago used a clause in its Enron contract to cancel the deal in early December.

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) Chairman and Chief 
Executive Ken Lay's career as a corporate board member could end this spring, 
corporate governance experts said. 

Pressure is starting to build on companies to remove Lay and other 
Enron board members from their boards, said Patrick McGurn, director of 
corporate programs at Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., which advises 
large institutional investors on voting matters. 

Earlier Friday, the AFL-CIO announced it sent letters to 21 public 
companies encouraging them not to renominate any Enron board members to their 
own boards when they send out proxies this year. 

""Typically, you want directors to bring praise, not scrutiny,"" McGurn 
said, ""it would be surprising to see (Lay) serve on any board after annual 
meeting season,"" McGurn said. 

Lay, who resigned as head of Enron on Wednesday, once served on the 
boards of a number of high-profile public companies. Over the past 12 
months, he has resigned from the all the corporate boards on which he served 
except for NewPower Holdings Inc. (NPW) and Enron. 

Richard Koppes, an attorney with Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue who 
advises companies on corporate governance issues, said Enron board members 
will have a much harder time now keeping and obtaining corporate board seats. 

""If I'm on a board and somebody said we wanted to bring on a former 
Enron board member, I'd start looking for another nominee,"" Koppes said. 

Lay resigned from the board of I2 Technologies Inc. (ITWO) in October 
2001 and stepped down as a director at Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ) and Eli 
Lilly & Co. (LLY) in December. He also had served on the board of EOTT 
Energy Corp. (EOT), but resigned in May. 

NewPower hasn't decided whether it will renominate Lay as a director 
for the coming year, according to spokeswoman Terri Cohen. The energy 
company plans to mail proxies to shareholders in mid-April for an annual 
meeting tentatively scheduled for sometime in May. 

""I can't speculate whether Mr. Lay will or will not be on the proxy"" 
for the upcoming annual meeting,"" Cohen told Dow Jones Newswires. 

Cohen said that ""if someone wanted to resign that's one thing, but 
that hasn't been discussed with Mr. Lay.""

AFL-CIO takes aim at Enron directors
Urges that they be kicked off other corporate boards

By Lisa Sanders <mailto:lsanders@marketwatch.com>, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 12:04 PM ET Jan. 25, 2002
WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) - The AFL-CIO on Friday called on companies with Enron directors on their boards to refuse to re-nominate the 10 people, citing the group's failure to properly oversee the bankrupt energy merchant's accounting practices.
Enron directors serve on boards ranging from Motorola to Lockheed Martin.
""Directors who permitted the accounting deception that led to the collapse of a company worth over $70 billion are not suited to serve on other boards,"" the AFL-CIO's Richard Trumka said in a statement.
Enron directors, among other things, failed to question the company's use of off-balance sheet financings to cover up debt and losses. The directors also waived conflict-of-interest rules to allow Enron executives to create limited partnerships that led to a $1.2 billion equity reduction, and they approved the annual report without confirming it was ""straightforward and comprehensible,"" the AFL-CIO said.
The AFL-CIO pointed out that shareholders could retaliate against board members they feel are unsuitable by withholding votes.
""Barring Enron's directors from future service at other companies will hopefully prevent this type of catastrophic loss for workers from happening again,"" Trumka said.
Enron director Robert Belfer also sits on the board of Westport Resources Corp.; Norman Blakes serves on Comdisco and Owens Corning boards; Ronnie Chan is a member of the boards of Hang Lung Group, Standard Chartered PLC, and Motorola; John Duncan sits on the board of Group 1 Automotive; Wendy Gramm, serves as a director for AMVESCAP PLC/Invesco Funds Group; Robert Jaedicke is a member of the board of the California Water Service Group; Ken Lay, who has resigned from Eli Lilly and Compaq's boards, sits on the NewPower Holdings board; John Mendelsohn is a member of the ImClone Systems board; Frank Savage serves as a director for Lockheed Martin, Qualcomm, and Alliance Capital Management; John Wakeham is a board member to Bristol & West PLC, Vosper Thornycroft Holding PLC, Michael Page International PLC, and Rothchilds Continuation Holdings; and Herbert Winokur is a board member at NATCO Group, CCC Information Services Group and DynCorp.

AFL-CIO To Cos: Purge Enron Directors From Your Boards

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Faulting Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) board of directors for its role in the energy company's collapse, the AFL-CIO is calling on other companies to refrain from renominating the directors to their own boards.
In letters sent to 21 companies, the labor federation's secretary-treasurer, Richard Trumka, cited the Enron directors' decision to waive conflict-of-interest rules to let Enron executives participate in related-party transactions, among other things. 
""The future retirement security of practically every American worker was hurt by the collapse of Enron,"" Trumka said in a press release. ""In our opinion, directors who permitted the accounting deception that led to the collapse of a company worth over $70 billion dollars are not suited to serve on other boards."" 
Trumka noted Enron's bankruptcy filing, multiple investigations into its accounting practices and the ""evaporation"" of $70 billion in market capitalization. 
He criticized board members for their failure to raise questions about ""Enron's extensive use of off-balance-sheet entities to remove debt and losses"" from financial statements and ""for the company's overall lack of transparency."" 
AFL-CIO affiliate union sponsored benefit funds have more than $400 billion in assets and the organization estimates the funds lost more than $1 billion. 
An Enron spokesman said it was premature to make comments about issues under investigation. Individual board members either didn't immediately return a call for comment or couldn't immediately be reached.

Auditors for U.S. Contractors Restricted in Consulting Work
2002-01-25 16:59 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Accounting firms auditing federal payments to Lockheed Martin Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and other contractors will be barred from many kinds of consulting work for those clients.
     U.S. Comptroller General David M. Walker, who oversees U.S. government auditing standards, announced the restrictions as Congress considers similar limits on accounting firms working in the private sector, following Enron Corp.'s collapse.
     The new consulting restrictions apply to all federal agencies, nearly all state and local agencies, and defense contractors, health maintenance organizations, hospitals or other organizations that get federal money. For private-sector companies, the restrictions apply to the parts of their businesses funded by the federal government.
     ``This standard represents an important step to enhance the independence of external auditors and better protect the public,'' said Walker, who heads the U.S. General Accounting Office. The consulting limits will take effect on Oct. 1.
     Congressional investigations are examining the issue of auditor independence as part of the investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP, which made $27 million from non-audit work for Enron in 2000, more than the $25 million it was paid as auditor.

Restrictions on Audits

     The comptroller general's standards would prohibit auditors from reviewing their firm's own consulting work or performing management functions or decisions. Accounting firm employees who work as consultants won't be permitted to assist with audits.
     Accounting firms opposed the new rule on grounds it would be inconsistent with the standards in the private sector, the comptroller general said. The firms also contended that the new standards ``could cause a hardship'' on clients who pay the same firm for audit and consulting services, the announcement said.
     The Securities and Exchange Commission, Congress and accountants have debated for years whether consulting fees may make auditors reluctant to challenge questionable accounting by clients. In 2000, accounting firms blocked a proposed SEC ban similar to the new federal rule.
     Spokesman for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants declined immediate comment. Spokesmen at Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, both of which have headquarters in Washington suburbs, couldn't be reached.
     Walker's plan had been opposed by the AICPA, the trade group that blocked the SEC's attempt two years ago to prevent possible conflicts of interest at firms that do other work for audit clients.

Congressional Demands

     The GAO standards were announced a day after members from both parties in Congress urged tougher standards during hearings yesterday on Enron's collapse and its implications for auditors.
Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, who led the fight for a consulting ban two years ago, asked Congress to consider a legislative response.
     Among the most common consulting services provided by accounting firms are to set up and manage computer networks for clients and establish financial management systems that provide data used in their financial reports.
     In 2000, Lockheed Martin paid Ernst & Young LLP $6 million for its audit and $16 million for other services, and General Dynamics paid Andersen $4.2 million in audit fees and $9.5 million for other work, according to filings with the SEC.
     Spokesmen at Andersen, Ernst & Young, and the Deloitte & Touche firm couldn't be reached.
     Walker urged the large accounting firms to tighten their own conflict-of-interest standards for the private sector. The firms are in talks with SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt about forming a private sector group to oversee accountant discipline and audit review.
     Pitt, a Republican, has opposed a consulting ban.

IN THE MONEY: Enron Loan Shrinks; Is Liquidation Next?
By Carol S. Remond

01/25/2002
Dow Jones News Service

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The financing is disappearing fast. Will the company follow?
Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) much trumpeted $1.5 billion interim financing, designed to help the distressed energy company get back on its feet as it restructures under bankruptcy protection, has quickly and quietly been shrinking. 
The loan was preliminarily approved by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez on Dec. 3, just a day after the company filed for bankruptcy. But Enron's lead bankers J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C) soon found out that other banks, worried about their own exposure to Enron, weren't willing to take on any new Enron financing, and the loan was halved. 
The original loan agreement, referred to as debtor-in-possession financing, or DIP, was conditional on a full syndication of the financing and the return of $550 million in credit that J.P. Morgan and Citigroup had extended to Enron in November. 
Court documents show that meetings to approve Enron's interim financing have been postponed three times already. A meeting is now scheduled for Feb. 13. 
The final size of Enron's financing is yet to be decided, but the credit facility could ""shrink down south of $500 million,"" a banker familiar with the financing said. 
Meantime, now that Enron has unloaded its most valuable asset, its energy trading operations, to UBS AG in exchange for a share of future revenues, it's unclear just how much, if anything, remains to be salvaged. 
This might mean that Enron's bankruptcy could turn into a liquidation rather than the earlier-described rescue operation, some observers suggest. 
""It's possible that they won't need a DIP after all,"" a bankruptcy lawyer said. ""They're going to focus on asset sales, and it's possible that very little will be left at the end."" 
Indeed, J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup made the first $250 million DIP installment available to Enron in early December, but Enron has yet to tap the credit facility. 
""We don't need the money right now,"" said Martin Bienenstock, an attorney for lawfirm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP which represents Enron. He said Enron currently has around $1 billion in cash. 
Regardless, additional financing from the DIP lenders is contingent upon J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup approving Enron's new business plan. The two banks turned back a plan submitted by the company in early January, asking Enron to provide more details about asset sales and receivables, people familiar with the matter said. 
A banker said Enron is now in the process of doing ""a more thorough 'bottom up' analysis of its actual cash needs."" 
Creditors of a bankrupt company often fight to minimize the interim financing because of the high cost of such loans. Enron's DIP loan carries an interest of 350 basis points, or 3.5 percentage points, over the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. 
Given that under bankruptcy law, DIP financing is senior to all other loans, Enron creditors are also likely to resist letting assets already used to securitize some of Enron's numerous liabilities be subrogated to the collaterization of Enron's interim financing. 
Enron lawyer Bienenstock said the company and its banks will agree on the new DIP amount before the meeting scheduled for Feb 13.

POWER POINTS: Not So Fast On Enron Liquidation Theory
By Mark Golden

01/25/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) story of the week is that it's really headed toward a liquidation, not reorganization.
Don't buy the idea too quickly, but don't buy Enron stock, either. 
While it seems clear that Enron's debts will greatly outweigh its assets, there are several profitable parts of Enron that could easily continue to operate under a reorganized company, though almost certainly after changing its name. 
""In most large cases, if there's a reasonable expectation that a profitable company will emerge, the creditors' committee will support reorganization,"" said bankruptcy attorney Bruce Borrus of Riddell Williams in Seattle, a member of the American Bar Association's bankruptcy committee. ""The company as a going concern will often be more valuable than the value of the liquidated assets."" 
Enron's natural gas pipelines, except for the one that it must sell to Dynegy Inc. (DYN), could form the basis for a profitable future Enron that is worth more to creditors than total liquidation. To that foundation, Enron's coming reorganization proposal likely will add its share of the UBS/Enron future trading profits and its Enron Energy Services division. Even if recent reports of hidden losses are true, EES is almost certainly profitable now as a result of the bankruptcy process, which allowed the unit to shed hundreds of contracts. 
That's not the ""Big E"" of old, but it's not a small company, either. Enron Jr. could have several billion in assets. 
In addition, creditors will get a tax benefit from an ongoing Enron which could carry forward operational losses for years, said Lynn LoPucki, bankruptcy professor at UCLA law school. Congress has been trying to crack down on the trafficking of such tax benefits for decades, LoPucki said. A company that has real assets and a real operational business is much more likely to carry forward the losses and tax benefits successfully. 

First, The Shedding 

Enron is already selling its noncore assets as well as its oft-described ""crown jewel"" - its U.S. wholesale energy trading unit, including traders, back-office systems and EnronOnline technology. The sale to UBS AG (UBS) unit UBS Warburg doesn't include Enron's trading book, the value of which has deteriorated substantially due to contract terminations. 
To be sure, Enron's traders had built up a lot of value. Energy traders have said for months that Enron wisely shorted the market while U.S. natural gas and western power prices plunged from peaks reached in the first half of 2001. When Enron filed Chapter 11, it estimated the value of the portfolio at between $5 billion and $7 billion. 
Last week, when the sale was approved in bankruptcy court, Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said the energy book is now worth $1.3 billion. Enron's failure to deliver contracted gas and power killed many deals and much of the book's value. 
Enron spokesman Eric Thode clarified McMahon's statement this week, saying that $1.3 billion is the value primarily of the physical contracts that Enron hasn't defaulted on. 
Terminating financial contracts is more difficult for Enron's counterparties. The majority of gas and power deals done by Enron in the past couple of years haven't been for actual physical delivery of gas or power, but instead simply guaranteed energy prices and are settled monthly in cash. Depending on the terms of the contracts, some customers can't just walk away from their high-priced financial deals the way they can from physical deals when delivery is in question. 
""There may be value in those contracts,"" Thode said. ""We have tens of thousands of contracts to work through."" 
Calpine Corp. (CPN), for example, will have to pay Enron perhaps as much as $160 million under the liquidation terms of its contract with Enron. 
Some companies that have decided they can walk away from mark-to-market losses to Enron may find themselves sued by Enron or its estate, several industry sources said. Those defendants could argue that bankrupt Enron had no ability to protect them from a market upswing, so why should they be forced to cover their losses. It's like someone being forced to pay a premium to an insurance company that can't possibly pay a claim. 
This could take years of litigation and negotiation, but eventually result in significant cash for Enron - another reason for creditors to see Enron emerge from reorganization. 
Enron's sale of its trading operation - without portfolio - to UBS Warburg (UBS) is structured to result in the continued existence of Enron. Enron got nothing up front for creditors, but gets a third of profits for 10 years. UBS looks to be serious about doing big volumes of business and it isn't afraid to take risks. Maybe Enron executives kept in mind their own career opportunities outside of Enron when they negotiated the UBS deal. 
Add Enron Energy Services to the future business. Though EES' past profits now are in question, it's unquestionably a profitable business going forward because the bankruptcy court allowed Enron to drop hundreds of contracts that were money losers. EES has been doing everything possible to maintain deliveries under the remaining, profitable contracts, apparently with a lot of success. 
The likely continuation of an Enron, however, means little to current Enron shareholders, attorney Borrus said. Unless Enron can pay its creditors in full, the creditors will be issued equity in the new Enron, and current Enron stock will be worthless.

USA: Grand jury investigating Milberg Weiss - source.

01/25/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

LOS ANGELES, Jan 25 (Reuters) - A federal grand jury is investigating Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, a shareholder class action lawsuits specialist, over allegations the firm improperly gave money to plaintiffs to appear in its lawsuits, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not provide further details. But according to the Los Angeles Times, Steven Cooperman, a Beverly Hills eye surgeon convicted of faking the theft of two famous paintings, is assisting in the investigation.
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office had no comment on the matter. 
A spokeswoman for Milberg Weiss said it was ""fully cooperating"" with all inquiries, but would not confirm or deny whether the firm was under investigation. 
Milberg Weiss is famed for filing class action lawsuits on behalf of shareholders of publicly traded companies. The law firm has filed numerous recent lawsuits on behalf of shareholders of bankrupt energy trading firm Enron Corp. . 
Cooperman, who was convicted in 1999 of conspiracy, wire fraud and money laundering for the case, has been a plaintiff in more than 36 shareholder lawsuits, some of them filed by Milberg Weiss, according to the Times. 
He was sentenced to 37 months in prison last July. 
Investigators are looking into whether Cooperman and others may have received improper payments to appear in the lawsuits. The case is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles.

Enron's conscientious objector tried to challenge from inside
By JEFF DONN
Associated Press Writer

01/25/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - She was Texas' best: homegrown, church-schooled, smart, the next hope of an influential family in a small town outside Houston. But she wanted to be somebody beyond the oil wells and scrubby plains. 
Today, she is. Sherron Smith Watkins has emerged as the most prescient and principled voice yet in the financing morass that swamped energy dealer Enron Corp.
If a rebel, though, Watkins is no Eastern-style whistle-blower or protester. By the accounts so far, she did not threaten to go public. She did not quit. Call her the public face of Enron's loyal opposition, which tried to save it from the biggest business bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
""She just felt duty-bound to do it, for the company's sake,"" said her mother, Shirley Klein Harrington. 
Of course, doing your duty isn't always easy - and it wasn't for Watkins. She wasn't just worried about Enron when she told former chairman Ken Lay that good ethics could be good business. She fretted about losing her job in retaliation for her blunt words. 
""It was not easy for her to come forward because the environment was such and the culture was such that ... everything seemed to be accepted,"" said her Houston lawyer, Philip Hilder, who specializes in white-collar crime cases. ""It took a person with a lot of moxie and fortitude."" 
Apparently sorting out her own liabilities and waiting to testify for investigators, she is refusing interview requests. 
Ordinarily, though, she ""speaks her mind, and she's a competitor,"" said her mother. ""I think she was born with it."" 
Even now, fewer than 10,000 people live in Tomball, Watkins' hometown about 20 miles northwest of Houston. But her roots grew not so much from prairie sod as from the professional and commercial worlds. 
Her father is a Houston lawyer; her stepfather, a former school superintendent and now mayor of Tomball. Her mother taught accounting in high schools. One uncle owns a local supermarket and another, a funeral parlor. A nonconformist, cousin Lyle Lovett took up country singing. 
The family had just two girls, and they were treated pretty much as equals to boys, said her mother. Watkins used to hunt duck and deer. It was good training for Enron, where she would joust with traders and accountants on corporate terrain long dominated by men. 
""She's a pretty aggressive person,"" said a colleague who is still working at Enron and so asked that her name not be used. ""She expects a lot of people. If they're not pulling their weight ... she just zeros in on them, and she just rips them apart."" 
""She was working in a very rough-and-tumble ... company, and if she didn't have those qualities, she wouldn't be able to survive,"" her lawyer said. 
With English and German blood, she went to Lutheran parochial school. At home and school, she learned that some things were OK - and some weren't. ""Because this is a conservative community, there are very definite lines,"" said Sommy L. Ham, managing editor of the weekly Tomball Magnolia Tribune. 
Still, by eighth grade, Watkins was challenging authority. It was enough to make her mother pity her teacher. By high school, she was showing her mother's ease with numbers. 
She snared both bachelor's and master's degrees in a five-year accelerated accounting program, finishing in 1982 at the University of Texas, one of the country's best schools for the field. In a class taught by Phillip Langefeld, she studied cases where businesses misled investors. 
""She had an extremely good ability to analyze situations and to make comments and recommend based on what she thought was right,"" recalls Langefeld, now an Austin accountant. 
Degrees in hand, she landed work near home in Houston at Arthur Andersen, one of the profession's elite companies - well before its Enron embarrassments. She later transferred to New York City where she lived for several years. She leased a house with friends in the Hamptons on Long Island, developed a fancy for global finance and left Andersen for Metallgesellschaft. The German trading conglomerate lost so much money in oil trading in the early 1990s that it eventually needed a bank bailout to skirt bankruptcy. 
Watkins got out. Eight years ago, she came back to Houston to work for Enron. Like her, it was young, fast, and self-confident. It swelled in those years, at least by its calculations, into the seventh biggest American corporation. 
Over the next several years, Watkins worked its mergers and acquisitions and its fiber-optic cable division. For a time, she was jetting back and forth to South Korea. 
Her discomfort, though, began to surface several years ago. Uneasy with accounting methods in one Enron partnership, she was allowed to transfer to another branch of the company in 1996. 
But she could find comfort in her own family now. Married to an executive in a Canadian oil company, she gave birth to a girl over two years ago and took on the additional job of mother. She took it seriously, like her other work. She went to programs on child discipline and put her daughter in Sunday school at her Presbyterian church. 
She no longer scuba dives as she once did. But she has kept her taste for the good life and the world beyond southeast Texas. She lives with her husband and daughter in a big, renovated two-story house in a just-so district of Houston near Rice University. Homes shaded by live oaks favor brick or stucco, you can buy used books and eat hummus, and joggers puff through quiet streets in the pre-dawn humidity before heading off to work. Watkins, now 42, works out at her church gym and a university track. 
At Enron, things turned much worse last year, as recession thickened and Enron stock values crashed. Some executives began cashing out their stock. Watkins' lawyer won't say what she did with hers. Her mother isn't sure how her daughter handled her own stock, but Watkins never advised her mom to sell. She didn't and said she lost a small sum. 
At midyear, Watkins began working for chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. Increasingly, she fretted about partnerships he set up. To her understanding, they were backed by shaky financing, open to conflicts of interest, and endorsed by accounting sleights of hand. She quietly asked for advice from colleagues she trusted. Some were asking similar questions in private. 
The abrupt departure of chief executive Jeff Skilling in August made Watkins even more nervous. She feared the burst of public attention would force the hidden deals into the light and make the company ""implode in a wave of accounting scandals,"" according to the seven-page memo she wrote to Lay, then chairman. 
At first submitting the memo anonymously, she later expanded it and added her name. Lay met with her, ordered an internal inquiry, and in a move designed to get her out of Fastow's supervision, made her vice president for corporate development. 
In October, Enron was forced to acknowledge losses it had long buried in the partnerships. Investor confidence quickly crumbled, Enron requested bankruptcy protection, and shareholders and workers sued. On Wednesday, Lay, who was chief architect and overseer of Enron almost since its founding in 1985, resigned his post. 
Meanwhile, Watkins' lawyer said she is overwhelmed by hundreds of requests for interviews. Neighbor Chris Cagley, also an accountant who contracted with Enron, has watched from close up. 
""It's a lot of stress ... in terms of the legal risk and just the attention. I don't think she's the sort of person to seek attention,"" 
Given that, she appears to be holding up well. ""I would be falling apart,"" said friend and next-door neighbor, Charlotte Ten Brink. ""She maintains her sense of humor. We joked about who will play her in the movie: She usually laughs and takes it all in stride."" 
""She's praying to keep her job and that the company survives,"" adds her mother. 
She still goes to work at Enron, where she has taken on a different title: vice president of communication. She expects to be doing plenty of communicating in coming months with lawyers, investigators, and reporters. She's somebody beyond her dreams, beyond her wishes.

Enron spread its net far and wide in bid to protect its business interests

The dollar trail snaked from Enron Corp.'s hometown of Houston to the Texas capital of Austin to Washington, D.C. Along the way, politicians who could help the energy trader got money for their campaign chests. 
From there, the largesse of the company and its employees extended well beyond George W. Bush, Texas' top elected officials and nearly half of Congress. Their charity donations built a web of goodwill nationwide while benefitting individuals and causes from cat shelters to art museums, from Christian missionaries to Planned Parenthood.
Former Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay, who resigned from his job this week but remains on Enron's board of directors, was known in Houston as the man to woo for favors and contributions to charitable causes and civic improvement projects. 
""Enron operated in a way that was reminiscent of the way tobacco companies historically operated before they came under so much fire,"" said Bill Miller, a political consultant based in Austin who has worked for both Democrats and Republicans. ""If you asked for $5,000, they might say, 'Well wouldn't $10,000 be better?""' 
Some Enron observers insist the company was simply doing an effective job protecting its interests at various political levels while being a good corporate citizen in Houston and beyond. But critics say the strategy was carefully planned to buy influence and improve the company's bottom line. 
""The ways they did it weren't unique, but they did it more aggressively than anyone else,"" said Andrew Wheat, research director for Texans for Public Justice, a group critical of Enron's contributions to state politicians in Texas and national politicians around the country. 
The donations are facing more scrutiny after the company's rapid collapse into bankruptcy late last year, following revelations that it hid billions of dollars of debt in a series of partnerships that benefited some company executives. It has raised questions of whether Enron managed to avoid scrutiny of its often secretive operations that might have revealed the company's problems earlier. 
""Maybe they trimmed the edges off of policies that would have been quite objectionable,"" said Daron Shaw, a government professor at the University of Texas in Austin. ""Since they were working both sides of the aisle, they wanted to minimize the chances of maximum regret."" 
An Enron spokesman said the company, once listed No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list, and its top executives acted no differently than any other top businesses and their leaders. 
The political contributions were ""something every company does to support like-minded individuals that support the efforts of a particular company,"" said the spokesman, Eric Thode. 
And he said it was a ""travesty"" that people might criticize Enron's charitable donations, saying ""it's a figment of the imagination that there is anything sinister about being a good corporate citizen."" 
Of the $5.77 million in contributions to candidates the company has made since 1989, nearly three-fourths went to Republicans. In the 2000 election, it gave $2.4 million to individual candidates, political action committees and soft money contributions to political parties, said the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog group. 
Over those 12 years, according to the center, 71 current senators and 188 House members have benefited from Enron's donations. Topping the list were Texas' two Republican senators, Kay Bailey Hutchison and Phil Gramm, each receiving almost $100,000, and seven Texan representatives led by Democrat Ken Bentsen with $42,750. 
Enron was a major contributor to the Bush presidential campaign and donated $100,000 for the Bush-Cheney inaugural gala last a year ago, a sum matched by Lay and his wife. 
Gramm's wife Wendy is on Enron's board and also served on its audit committee, which is supposed to keep a close watch on the company's financial practices. By their own accounting, the Gramms lost nearly $700,000 in stock options when the company went under. Wendy Gramm collected between $915,000 and $1.85 million from Enron in salary, attendance fees, stock options and dividends between 1993 and 2001, according to Public Citizen, a Washington watchdog group. 
Wendy Gramm took a seat on Enron's board in 1993, just five weeks after resigning as chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where she pushed through a key regulatory exemption that benefited Enron. 
She heads the regulatory studies program at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, which received $50,000 from Enron since 1996, less than 1 percent of total corporate gifts to Mercatus. 
Gramm said he had no warning of the company's bankruptcy or its dire financial situation. And he said his wife had done nothing wrong from her vantage point on Enron's board and audit committee. 
Another board member on the audit committee, Lord John Wakeham, a former leader of the British House of Commons, received a $72,000 yearly consulting contract for ""services rendered"" to Enron's European arm, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And Enron board member Herbert S. Winokur Jr. is a managing partner of the company that owns the National Tank Co., which had $370,294 in sales to Enron subsidiaries. 
The side deals with board members raise serious questions about their ability to perform their duty of making sure top managers were doing their jobs, said Harold Star, a management professor and corporate governance expert at the State University of New York at Buffalo. 
""You've got a board that's passive, co-opted and basically corrupted in terms of its role,"" Star said. 
Enron board members also had ties around the country through their charitable contributions. For example, Robert Belfer, the company's largest shareholder, and his wife gave $7.5 million for the Robert and Renee Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. He graduated from the school. 
Lay and his wife Linda gave generously to causes primarily based in Houston through the Linda and Ken Lay Family foundation, which donated $2,546,771 in 2000, according to Internal Revenue Service records. 
The foundation also contributed to out-of-state groups, including $10,000 to the American Dance Festival in New York; $28,900 to the Washington, D.C.-based Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy; $125,000 to the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago; $6,700 to Knox Theological Seminary in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; $60,000 to Louisiana State University's Manship School of Mass Communications; and $6,627 to Ozarks Public TV in Springfield, Mo. 
Lay's influence alone was profound in Houston, where he had a sterling reputation as one of the city's most prominent movers and shakers. 
Miller, the political consultant, said he and other lobbyists asked for Lay's help several years ago when a problem finding financing for a parking garage threatened a plan to bring a basketball arena to Houston. 
""He sent a memo to some CEOs for a meeting in Houston, and it meant forking over a lot of money, millions of dollars,"" Miller said. ""When the meeting was over, the deal was done. You can only do that if you are giving a lot of money or helping a lot of other people make money."" 
It was Lay's connection to influential black groups in Houston that helped get out the vote in favor of a successful 1996 referendum to build a new baseball stadium that would be named Enron Field, said David Walden, chief of staff to Houston Mayor Bob Lanier from 1992 to 1998. 
Walden said he believes Lay worked to improve Houston out of a sense of civic duty. 
""He thought it was important for the image of the city to have the stadium downtown,"" Walden said. ""Having pro sports franchises and the ballet was a great recruiting tool and the folks he wanted to attract (as Enron employees) paid attention to those things,"" Walden said. 
But Enron's generosity was also aimed at impressing influential people with the power to help or hurt the company, said Ralph Estes, accounting professor emeritus at American University and the author of ""Tyranny of the Bottom Line: Why Corporations Make Good People Do Bad Things."" 
""Most of the rationale is that somehow it will pay off on the bottom line,"" he said. ""It's calculated to pay a dividend, and these actions can keep the wolves from the door.""

CAPITAL VIEWS: Enron, Stimulus & More On 'Phraseology'
By John Connor

01/25/2002
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan sees a silver lining in the Enron debacle.
""I'm surprised, as I suspect most of us are, at the extraordinary interest that has been devoted to this particular episode,"" Greenspan told the Senate Budget Committee Thursday. ""And I think it's a very good sign. 
""I think that it tells us that because the whole structure of American business is so fundamentally based on trust, that any abrogation of that trust creates a real furor, which it should,"" the Fed chairman added. 
""Think of the worst outcome, namely, that we went through this particular episode and nobody cared,"" he said. 
""We are increasingly getting firms which are conceptual, and Enron being a classic case, whose value depends increasingly on reputation and trust,"" Greenspan continued. ""And if you breach that, that value goes away very rapidly."" 
He said an abrogation of goodwill clearly has happened in the Enron case and that this has been taken very seriously by peoplein the U.S. ""And I think that's very good,"" he said of the reaction. 
Sen. Jon Corzine, D-N.J., the onetime major-domo of Goldman Sachs, wondered if the Enron mess can so call into question the efficacy of accounting standards and investments as to have an impact broadly applicable to the economy, leading perhaps to an increase in the cost of capital and to serious concerns by foreigners who have been investing in the U.S. 
""It just strikes me that this runs the risk of truly undermining businss and consumer confidence in a way that is not given the centerpiece,"" Sen. Corzine said. 
Greenspan wasn't buying it. ""I actually don't have that concern,"" he told the senator. He said the extraordinary response to Enron is ""an indication that people in this society have - require that we maintain a very high standard of trustworthiness in our business operations."" 
Greenspan said that ""the reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking in a lot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to information coming of business and into the investment community."" He said, ""I think we're going to find there's going to be a good deal less of that and that the old issue of competing for reputation is going to reemerge."" 
On fiscal policy, Greenspan let considerable air out of the ongoing stimulus debate on Capitol Hill, telling the Senate panel that ""I myself am conflicted on the issue"" and that ""it's not clear that we might need that insurance."" 
Republicans and Democrats have been duking it out since last autumn on stimulus. The pace quickened in recent days, with Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., depicting Senate Majority Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., as a poster boy for obstructionism and Daschle calling the Republican hand by putting a slimmed-down stimulus plan on the Senate floor as the second session of the 107th Congress got underway. 
Greenspan said he hasn't come to a conclusion on the need for a stimulus package. He said there are pluses and minuses. And then he said, ""I do not think it is a critically important issue to do. 
""I think the economy will recover in any event,"" he added. 
Elsewhere, as has been widely noted, Greenspan also spiked his Jan. 11 San Francisco commentary about ""significant risks"" and put a happier glow on his economic outlook. 
Greenspan explained that he was talking Jan. 11 to markets (that ""have been assuming a far more rapid snapback than I frankly think is likely to happen"") and that he used ""a phraseology which, in retrospect, I should have done differently, which sort of has implied that I didn't think that the economy was in the process of turning. And I tried to rectify that in today's remarks."" 
Extraordinary, as the man himself might put it. 
Included in Greenspan's explanation was what might be called a central banker's lament: ""It's very difficult, in giving any speech of, say, 20 minutes, 25 minutes, to capture a particular view at a complex time such as this.""

Enron Asks Ct For Quick OK Of India Unit Sale To BG Grp
By Kathy Chu

01/25/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
(This report was first published late Thursday.) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) is asking a federal bankruptcy court for speedy approval of its Enron Oil & Gas India unit sale to BG Group PLC (BRG) for $350 million cash.
The transaction must be completed by Feb. 15, according to court documents, or BG Group, a U.K. oil and gas company, can walk away. 
An ""overwhelming need"" exists to promptly close the sale, the distressed company said in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York. Failure to ""expeditiously authorize the approval of the sale of EOGIL will adversely affect the ability to close on this valuable transaction,"" according to Enron. 
The operation, or management rights, of Enron's upstream oil and gas assets in India is not a condition of the re-negotiated deal. 
The energy-trading company - which originally signed a deal to sell the assets to BG for $388 million - is asking the bankruptcy court for an early February hearing to consider approval of the transaction. 
Enron's deal with BG Group represents its ""highest and best offer,"" the bankrupt company said, and comes after about 18 months of talks with more than 70 different parties. 
BG Group couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
The purchase price is subject to working-capital adjustments of $66 million, as well as a $10 million fee-and-service payment to Enron subsidiaries. 
Enron has agreed to transfer certain computer equipment and provide operational support for 60 days to BG Group. With the deal, Enron believes that it will be ""burdened"" with the continuing costs of maintaining the unit, which conducts upstream oil and gas activities and owns interests in three production-sharing contracts with the Government of India. 
Enron Oil and Gas India has more than 200 employees. 
Enron Asset Holdings LLC - the parent of Enron Oil and Gas India - will escrow net proceeds of the sale transaction. The funds could be subject to any claims by Enron's post-petition lenders, according to court documents. 
Jeffrey B. Sherrick, president of the unit, will resign his position upon completion of the deal. He will remain a director of the company until BG Group appoints its own board members. 
The sale of the unit, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, is part of Enron's attempt to focus on its core operations. 
Since filing for bankruptcy Dec. 2, the company's efforts to shed away some of its 3,500 subsidiaries - expected to give it a better shot at successfully reorganizing - have intensified. Enron has fielded offers for its turbines, generators, power-plant projects, and oil and gas interests, among other assets, according to the filing. 
Late Thursday, Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez - who is overseeing Enron's Chapter 11 case - scheduled a hearing to consider the sale of the Enron unit for Feb. 13 at 2 p.m. EST. 
The court, on that day, is also expected to address the bankrupt company's final debtor-in-possession financing proposal.

Enron LNG Shipping Co Files For Chapter 11 Protection
By Kathy Chu

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Another Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) subsidiary has filed for Chapter 11 court protection, bringing the distressed company's bankrupt units to 38.
Enron LNG Shipping Co., in a late Thursday filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, listed total assets of $952,099 and total debts of $935,331, excluding off-balance sheet transactions and contingent obligations. 
The unit, which charters liquefied natural gas tankers for company affiliates, is entirely owned by Enron Global LNG - also under bankruptcy court protection. 
Enron LNG Shipping has no secured creditors and doesn't list its 20 largest unsecured creditors, stating instead that this portion of the application is ""not applicable."" 
The unit, incorporated in Grand Cayman of the Cayman Islands, is being pledged as collateral under Enron Corp.'s credit agreements, including a debtor-in-possession financing led by J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C). 
The bankruptcy court has assigned Enron LNG case number 02-10346. 
The beleaguered company and its units began filing for Chapter 11 Dec. 2. It's the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

Dynegy Seems To Have Options In Enron Deal
By Rebecca Smith and Robin Sidel
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal

With the stock market telling Dynegy Inc. that energy trader Enron Corp. isn't worth even half what Dynegy has offered to pay, analysts and investors are paying close attention to the circumstances under which Dynegy could bargain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal. 
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy offered to buy its far larger cross-town rival in an all-stock deal that currently values Enron shares at $10.85 apiece, or a total of about $9.2 billion. But in the wake of post-agreement disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substantially less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m. trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cents to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the per-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.
Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreement with Enron contains a broad ""material adverse change"" clause as well as some specific trigger points that could be invoked. 
Dynegy officials performed ""due diligence"" throughout the holiday weekend, seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffered a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved assets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnerships. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an ""accounting error"" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since Oct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earnings. 
An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the two sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provisions ""are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy shareholders."" Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreement. 
Clauses related to a ""material adverse change,"" also known as a ""material adverse effect,"" have been the focus of much attention among merger professionals this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the economic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisitions. 
But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are considered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctant to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins. 
Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views that a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-processing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of meat-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP's earnings and a write-down of an IBP subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, saying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP's business and the accounting issue. 
In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr. wrote that "" . . . the important thing is whether the company has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operations that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercially reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rather than months."" 
That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, prompting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under which deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a handful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity would qualify as a ""material adverse change,"" or MAC. 
A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change is ""whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is it just a hiccup,"" says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acquisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that a court ""may be skeptical"" if Dynegy claimed that Enron's post-merger agreement disclosures were a surprise. 
The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting either side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a substantially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In such a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million ""topper fee"" to Dynegy and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc. 
Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces ""pending or threatened"" litigation liabilities that are ""reasonably likely"" to cost Enron $2 billion. If those liabilities hit $3.5 billion ""an Enron material event will be deemed to have occurred,"" presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In some situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well. 
Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn't believe that losses arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material event. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company faces more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other offenses. 
Deal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in Enron's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate its terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron's worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be difficult in light of the company's highly publicized problems and Dynegy's frequent statement that it clearly understands Enron's businesses. Still, there is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dynegy to terminate the deal if ""any representation or warranty of Enron shall have become untrue."" 
Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in stock prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of Topeka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western's utilities. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its ""duty of good faith and fair dealing"" and said the New Mexico company tried to ""sabotage"" the deal as the two companies' stock prices diverged. Public Service denies the accusations.

NEW YORK -- The options market dozed, as many participants stayed home to recover from too much turkey and football. 
The Chicago Board Options Exchange's market volatility index, or VIX, which measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 Index option prices to gauge investor sentiment, remained in a tight range during the abbreviated trading session the day after Thanksgiving. It fell 0.53 to 24.79.
VIX typically ranges between 20 and 30. A rise indicates traders and money managers are becoming anxious about the stock market; a fall shows investor optimism. 
Volatility has been dropping from post-Sept. 11 levels in recent weeks amid victories over the Taliban in Afghanistan and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and other central banks. VIX ranged between 30 and 40 for several weeks following the attacks. 
Volatility is likely to remain low, said Mika Toikka, head of options strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston. ""Typically, going into the Thanksgiving and December holidays, we tend to experience a seasonal drift lower in implied volatility. We would expect the same this year, especially in markets outside the U.S. where volatility is still lingering at high levels,"" Mr. Toikka wrote in a recent research note. 
The CBOE's Nasdaq Volatility index, or VXN, a sentiment barometer for the technology sector, fell 1.86 to 50.82 while the American Stock Exchange's Nasdaq volatility index, or QQV, dropped 1.03 to 42.74. 
Elsewhere in the options market: 
Calls in Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, continued to trade briskly, with one investor buying 10,000 January 5 calls and simultaneously selling 12,250 January 10 calls. 
More than 14,800 of the January 5 contracts traded, compared with open interest of 3,640, as shares fell 33 cents, or 6.6%, to $4.68. These calls cost $1.40 on the American Stock Exchange where most of the volume was traded. 
More than 15,000 of the January 10 contracts traded, compared with open interest of 30,674. These out-of-the-money calls cost 30 cents on the Amex. 
Eli Lilly & Co.'s December 80 out-of-the-money puts also were popular Friday, as shares fell 91 cents, or 1.1%, to $82.42. Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the company to neutral from outperform, saying the stock has become too expensive even with Food and Drug Administration approval of its potential blockbuster drug Xigris, which treats septic infections. More than 3,000 of these puts traded, compared with open interest of 6,427. They cost $1.25 on the CBOE, which saw much of the volume.

The Corporation: Acquisitions
The Other Instant Powerhouse in Energy Trading

It's not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in October, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at more than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chairman David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drilling for more oil and gas. 
Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is making the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, while ChevronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operations, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's earnings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says analyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping oil at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Chevron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene Nowak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have margin improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and other ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment. 
Until now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stake for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled three of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake has been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says. 
Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, ChevronTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O'Reilly to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a natural-gas company. Maybe it's not so bad being No. 4.

ALL EYES ON THE ENRON PRIZE If the deal holds, Dynegy will walk away with some juicy assets
By Stephanie Anderson Forest, with Wendy Zellner in Dallas, and Peter Coy and Emily Thornton in New York

As Houston-based Enron Corp. imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its finances, few would have blamed Dynegy Inc. CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher crosstown rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garnering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business. 
Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, CEO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay didn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and the company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic answer could be: Bail us out.
So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of coffee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy announced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 billion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key to the deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up Enron's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dynegy's 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp. 
Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $100 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``I don't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's been incredible to watch.'' 
Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment yet. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $200 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now. 
That would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has worked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, believing it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expertise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and paper. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It would have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to match Enron's. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commercial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers such as Wendy's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to get rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, including the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in India. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will have the right to Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estimated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. 
Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operation earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We looked under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it was.'' 
But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs ticking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial partnerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the necessary due diligence,'' says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities Inc. Dynegy's Bergstrom counters: ``We're pretty certain that most everything of material consideration has been disclosed.'' If not? The massive earnings boost provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of course, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for its intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy's operations are more conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to issue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It should help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parachute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a management job with the new company. 
Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online trading and commercial services. Still, Dynegy's 361% stock gains last year eclipsed Enron's 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay's execs got more credit. ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been at the forefront of this business,'' says Bruce M. Withers, who sold his Trident NGL Inc. to Dynegy in 1995. Watson will get more attention next year--he's a 15% owner of the new Houston Texans pro football team. But with his bold takeover of Enron, Watson has ensured that he's off the sidelines for good.

CONFUSED ABOUT EARNINGS? You're not alone. Here's what companies should do--and what investors need to know
By Nanette Byrnes and David Henry 
With Mike McNamee in Washington

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After years of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past three years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It was confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had announced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hideously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Management pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to exclude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's net worth. 
Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far short of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, but it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge off a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory that aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if companies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those charges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s.
Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issue--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If even the most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company actually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial markets have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made the U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporations. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, could fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnished. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' says Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board. 
Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in their own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors and analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variety of names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such version. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcement, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring net income'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn? 
Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numbers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a company's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts, and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone who uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. accounting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performance of ongoing operations. 
That's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calculated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, comparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certainly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and perhaps restrict use of pro formas. 
What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings and a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, investors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited net-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the other. ``OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when tallying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, would be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standards Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings. 
``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures has grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of hand,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnings are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, we better all know what we're looking at.'' 
Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to generally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in earnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It's $10.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to the SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies.) 
The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers using GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38. 
How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with increased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earnings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conventional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. These customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and allowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma formulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&P's tallies fall between the two: S&P's numbers are more systematic than pro forma, but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investors are facing a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired KPMG partner. ``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.'' 
That makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter ended on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three earnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the telecommunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possible pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,'' including some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still better 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges,'' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivables. Wall Street chose the rosiest one. 
Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointing out that they're merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a measure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for those operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operating earnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, as companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and investors are free to ignore everything else. 
There's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Near the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its assets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions into line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Despite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions and involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year ending in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past five years added up to only $5 billion. 
Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of hand. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion charge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to describe what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R. Muller, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Analysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business is going to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic--a fair gauge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investors to judge. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operating earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including severance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company of stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairment of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of an asset. 
When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the difference between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using GAAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the company put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cents. 
The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investors shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring charges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked for comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it still wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off another wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new rules. 
The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attacks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rules for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told companies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a company's general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those costs out in their unaudited press releases. 
Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shaping up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aftereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that are unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a growing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time charges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterday's errors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better. 
The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a charge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to distort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall into a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructuring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were purchased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inventory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School professor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling these charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from their pro forma calculations. 
Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings history. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real shareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so far this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareholders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings can obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate operating earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best possible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the income statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings break out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out there for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should investors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999, and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and potential? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had booked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these aren't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economics & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanished into write-offs. 
Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that excess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnings can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or charges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for most companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been taken in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earnings. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' says Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant. 
Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug them off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poised for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared with a 6% runup for the S&P 500. 
Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, information-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could depress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-time events?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperformed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors are apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy doesn't continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that changes the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that reflects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangible assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their properties periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its member controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect to take more charges. 
But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless there is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, valuing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. ``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors coming up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Professor Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.'' 
While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings games, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the dot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``funds from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FFO is very simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than another one's even if they had identical fundamental results.'' 
There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and restore GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanley, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens says companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their press releases with the SEC. 
At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see numbers floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no question is more important to investors.

High-Gloss Glossary
Companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin on
their results. Here's what those terms mean:
DEFINING EARNINGS:
NET INCOME
The bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Sometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securities &
Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.
OPERATING EARNINGS
An adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrelated
to the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figure
called ``operating income'' (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it is
not an audited figure.
CORE EARNINGS
Another term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings are
calculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything the
preparer wishes.
PRO FORMA EARNINGS
The 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometimes
excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The
granddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries that
carried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widely
quoted.
ADJUSTED EARNINGS
A new term for pro forma.
DEFINING COSTS:
SPECIAL CHARGES
A general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and
therefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.
ASSET IMPAIRMENTS
Charges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to its
current market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on internal
venture-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks at
inflated prices.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS
The same idea as asset impairments except they're used to write down the
premium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible assets
acquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because of a
change in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill
amortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair values.
RESTRUCTURING RESERVES
An accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down a
portion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs and
if overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.
WRITE-DOWN
Lowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It is
often excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cost
long ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cash
costs, such as investment-banking fees.

What did the company earn? That's the most basic question an investor can ever ask. The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the years depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron Corp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were overstated by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without auditors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek included) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accounting rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Corporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial reporting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the global marketplace (page 76). 
The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriously wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business model customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expenses in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Street conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the method of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.
A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GAAP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-time expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing operations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The result is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call standards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAAP. How can investors make intelligent decisions? 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agency Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating earnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedowns from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merger and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill, and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should build on. The accounting anarchy has to end.

Up Front: AFTERLIVES
FREE AND CLEAR OF ENRON'S WOES

Back in Enron's heyday, one of its rising stars was Rebecca Mark. Nicknamed ``Mark the Shark'' because of her ferocious ambition, she made her name in the early '90s building the energy giant's international operations, including the now-troubled Dabhol power plant in India. Once rumored to be a successor to Enron CEO Ken Lay, she resigned from Enron in August, 2000, after two years of heading Enron's ailing water company spin-off, Azurix. 
These days, as Enron struggles to stay afloat, Mark-Jusbasche (who hyphenated her name with that of her husband of two years) is watching the action from the sidelines. And she'd like to keep it that way. ``I'm very surprised and saddened by [what has happened at Enron], and I wish them all the best,'' she says. Beyond that, Mark-Jusbasche, 47, is not much interested in talking about Enron, which is being acquired by a small rival after a spectacular Wall Street flameout. Mark left Enron with millions of dollars worth of Enron shares, although she says she has sold them since.
Mark-Jusbasche spends most of her time serving on advisory boards, both at Yale and Harvard business schools, as well as the school where her 16-year-old twin sons from a previous marriage are sophomores. 
In her spare time, she seeks out opportunities for investing. Currently, Mark-Jusbasche is considering alternative-energy and water-technology companies. A farm girl from Missouri, she has one investment focus that's especially dear to her heart: looking into expanding her cattle ranches. She now owns 15 acres in New Mexico. ``I'm doing things that are fun, interesting, and important to me--family and community,'' she says. Sure beats being anywhere near Enron.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron still optimistic of averting financial meltdown.
By ANDREW HILL and SHEILA MCNULTY.

11/26/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron said yesterday it was still expecting outside investors to inject $500m to $1bn into the group, as talks continued to avoid a financial meltdown at the energy trading group. 
Dynegy, whose rescue bid for its Houston rival is crucial to Enron's survival, spent last week's Thanksgiving holiday and the weekend reviewing Enron's operations and finances.
Dynegy said it remained ""optimistic for the potential of the merger to be completed, and in the time-frame we originally announced - six to nine months"". 
Enron's fate depends on a delicate, unofficial pact between its lenders, Dynegy, and credit ratings agencies, which have resisted downgrading the group's debt while the deal is pending. 
If the pact stays in place, at least $500m is likely to be invested in Enron by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, Enron's key lenders and advisers. A further $500m is being sought from private equity firms. 
But if Dynegy pulls out of the deal, the cash infusion could be put in jeopardy and the ratings agencies could downgrade the debt to junk, triggering debt repayments across a network of partnerships and off-balance-sheet vehicles linked to Enron. 
Enron confirmed yesterday that it was still seeking additional liquidity from new equity investors, but would not discuss their identities. 
Enron's crisis of confidence became more acute last week when the shares fell from $9 to $4.74 following a regulatory filing that revealed the extent of the group's debt burden. 
Completion of a $1bn secured credit line from JPM Chase and Citigroup, and the postponement of a $690m notes repayment due tomorrow were not sufficient to prop up the share price. The bonds also fell to levels consistent with a potential bankruptcy filing. 
The slide in the share price has encouraged speculation that Dynegy is preparing to renegotiate its all-stock bid, now worth $9.3bn, compared with Enron's market value of $3.5bn. 
But people close to Enron say renegotiation of the deal would not in itself have any impact on the energy group's finances. Latest news, www.ft.com/enron.

Schwab Chief's Main Theme: Diversification
By Lynnette Khalfani
Dow Jones Newswires

11/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- More than two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many investors remain edgy. But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has shown remarkable resilience. 
Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, experts say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep their wits about them.
In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive of Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokerage firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mistakes they should avoid. 
Here are some excerpts from the interview: 
In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you think is in the financial markets? Or do you think it's just that people's perceptions about risk have changed? 
I've been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, the risk hasn't changed. The risk is always there. There's risk in investing in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctuations]. There's risk in real estate, too. 
So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Over a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty darned well. When they don't . . . sometimes it's fatal. If the only stock an investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal. 
What do you say to people who say they're too scared to invest right now? That because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afghanistan, the recession, and so forth, there's just too much uncertainty in the markets? 
I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. We were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thing is no different. It's awful -- particularly for our children. But this country is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and the strength of our government. 
There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we've had many recessions. It's not fun, especially when you begin reading about all these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pretty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won't get better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully before the economy goes up. 
There's $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That's a huge resource and buying power that's definitely available for new investments. 
What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past two or so months? 
They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn't use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver. 
Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You're not going to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles of fear and greed. Even when I'm fearful of something, I say to myself: ""This is still the time to invest."" 
My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, ""I just don't want to be in the stock market at all."" And it's just the time that people should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio. 
Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the poster child of the last cycle. Or people say, ""I'll get back in [the market] when I see the economy turn around."" Well, by the time they see that, it's too late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.

Enron Pursuing a Cash Infusion Energy: Company is seeking as much as $1billion as it tries to shore up its endangered acquisition by Dynegy.
From Bloomberg News

11/26/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition
C-2
Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. said talks are continuing with potential investors for an infusion of as much as $1 billion as the biggest energy trader tries to avoid a collapse of its planned purchase by Dynegy Inc. 
An investment would ease concern that Enron's weakened finances may prompt Dynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms of the transaction, which is valued at $23 billion in stock and assumed debt.
Enron is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in cash but wouldn't divulge details. ""We are not going to discuss the particulars of who we are talking to,"" Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Sunday. 
Shares of the Houston company fell by 48% in the last three trading sessions on the New York Stock Exchange. At Friday's closing price of $4.71, the stock sells for less than half the $10.85 that Dynegy is slated to pay in the acquisition. That's a sign investors are skeptical the transaction will go through as planned. 
Enron is likely to have approached Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co., Blackstone Group and Carlyle Group for a private equity investment, said industry analyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net. 
The firms have declined to comment. 
In a conference call Nov. 14, Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said the company is in talks with several private investors and expects to receive $500 million to $1 billion from those sources. 
On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690-million note due this week, gaining more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was ""encouraged"" by the commitment to extend the note payment as well as the closing of a $450-million credit facility. He said Dynegy remained committed to the purchase. 
Enron already received $1.5 billion in cash Nov. 13 from ChevronTexaco Inc. as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In return, Dynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline. Under the deal's terms, if Dynegy and Enron fail to merge, Dynegy can acquire the pipeline company. 
But Barron's reported over the weekend that Dynegy's right to the pipeline might be challenged by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., which accepted the asset as collateral for $1billion in loans to Enron. 
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa declined to comment on Enron's attempts to secure financing or whether more cash for Enron is a condition of keeping the merger alive. 
Enron's dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a federal investigation of the company, which restated its earnings and saw its credit ratings cut. 
The company said in a Securities and Exchange filing a week ago that it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left.

Dynegy Optimistic That Enron Merger Will Succeed - FT

11/26/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) remains optimistic, after further review of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) finances last week, that it will be able to buy the company, the Financial Times reported Monday. 
Dynegy said that it, ""remained optimistic for the potential of the merger to be completed, and in the time frame we originally announced - six to nine months,"" the FT reported.
Critical investment in Enron by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup will proceed only if an unofficial pact between Enron, Dynegy, and Enron's lenders and credit rating agencies remains intact, the report said. Investment from these two is likely to total between $500 million and $1 billion, while Enron continues to look for a further $500 million from private equity firms. 
The deal suffered a setback last week, when a regulatory filing revealed a greater debt burden than some investors had realized. Enron's share price fell following the report, to $4.74 from $9.00. 
A $1 billion secured credit line from J.P. Morgan Chase and an extension of a $690 million repayment due Tuesday weren't enough to keep the share price from falling. This led to speculation that Dynegy was considering renegotiating its all-stock bid, now at $9.3 billion, compared with Enron's market value of $3.5 billion, said the report. 
Renegotiating the deal wouldn't have any impact on Enron's finances, unnamed sources told the FT. 
But if Dynegy pulled out of the deal altogether, there might be no cash infusion from J.P. Morgan chase and Citigroup. Credit ratings agencies could then downgrade Enron's debt to junk, forcing partners to repay debts, the report said.

Dynegy Purchase Prompts Antitrust Concerns, L.A. Times Says
2001-11-26 07:36 (New York)


     Washington, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- California Attorney
General Bill Lockyer is examining Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
acquisition of rival energy seller Enron Corp. for possible
antitrust violations, the Los Angeles Times reported.

     The California Independent System Operator, which manages the
state's electric grid, has asked federal regulators to ban Dynegy
and other major power sellers, including Mirant, and AES Corp.'s
Williams Cos., from selling electricity at market prices in the
state, the Times said.

     Throughout the state's power crisis, Governor Gray Davis and
other officials accused Dynegy, Enron and other power companies of
withholding electricity and manipulating the cost of wholesale
power to gouge consumers, the Times said.

     Enron is negotiating with bankers to restructure $9.15
billion in debt.

     ``I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust
implications would consider this one carefully,'' California State
Senator Steve Peace, a Democrat, told the Times. ``If anything,
Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to
manipulate markets than it was before.''

India's Aditya Birla Not Eyeing Enron's Stake In Dabhol

11/26/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Aditya Birla Group on Monday denied local media reports that said it is considering acquiring U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s (ENE) stake in Dabhol Power Co. 
""I have checked with our directors and can tell you that the Aditya Birla Group has shown no expression of interest in Dabhol,"" said group spokeswoman Pragnya Ram.
The Economic Times and Financial Express reported the group is exploring the possibility of submitting an expression of interest with Indian financial institutions to buy Enron's stake in Dabhol. 
Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power plant located in Maharashtra state. 
Enron holds a controlling 65% stake in Dabhol. Costing $2.9 billion, the power project is the single largest foreign investment in India to date. 
Aditya Birla Group is a leading Indian conglomerate whose interests include textiles and cement. Its two joint ventures with Britain's Powergen PLC (PWG) to produce more than 1,000 MW of electricity in two Indian states haven't made much progress since their announcement in the mid-1990s.

The Enron scandal
A V Rajwade

11/26/2001
Business Standard
10
Copyright (c) Business Standard

Enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in risk management. It put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and had very strong management."" James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm. 
As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of management of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate disclosure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events over a period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its share value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest reports create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong?
No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India, Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project, elsewhere it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance and general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures would make an excellent case study!) 
But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, without much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 billion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, the charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launched an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly involved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other senior officials were sacked. 
Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards, reducing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat similar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating was downgraded. 
It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas trading, but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO. These comprised private equity, and Enron's share in each of the investee companies was kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts. To this end, outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fall below agreed threshold(s). 
All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations including J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suffered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid this and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creative accounting genius. 
Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over the rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by the company's auditors one of the Big Five firms, which was paid $ 25 million as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by Enron last year. 
The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the Enron management/board and the auditors were forced, on review, to admit that at least some of the transactions should have been on, rather than off, balance sheet. Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come out, but what has come out is bad enough. 
But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billion) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warrant. But it turned out to be just that for Enron. 
Perhaps because it was too arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lacked transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was always somewhat fragile? 
But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between trading and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aware of the opaqueness of the accounts,but few questioned the management aggressively on the subject. Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified the spirit of the times trading assets was what the ""masters of the universe"" did, not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars. The Enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal activity of trading in power and gas, with Skilling, the former CEO, claming that ""we are on the side of angels. We are taking on the entrenched monopolies. We are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world."" (The quotation is from an interview in BusinessWeek, prior to Skilling's inglorious exit from Enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst). 
For the analysts, there was also safety in numbers. Skilling claimed that ""Enron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial technologies and physical technologies"", bringing derivatives theory to trading in power and gas! Obviously, the fate of Long Term Capital Management has not led to more sober management of trading risks. 
Surely the role of ""markets"" should be to reduce the distance, and cost, between producer and consumer? One does feel that there is something perverse in a society that values, in terms of compensation, the trader (don't forget this is just a euphemism for the speculator) over the producer whether in the bond, currency or power and gas markets. The markets and, indeed, greed obviously have a role to play, but surely the pendulum needs to swing a little bit to the left?

India's Mehta Comments on Birla Group Offer to Buy Enron Stake
2001-11-26 03:42 (New York)

     Mumbai, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Jaywantiben Mehta, India's
union minister of state for power, comments on reports of Aditya
Birla Group, which owns Grasim Industry Ltd., the nation's third-
biggest cement maker, bidding for Enron's stake in Dabhol Power
Co.

     Enron wants to sell its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power,
India's biggest foreign investment, at cost. The project is mired
in a tariff dispute over $64 million in bills that haven't been
paid by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, for eight months.

     ``One more bidder will increase competition, which is
welcome.

     ``Any step in the national interest is good.

     ``Cheap energy is always in the national interest since we
want to increase electricity generation and sell it at a
reasonable price.

     ``I can't comment on the time-frame of buying out the Enron
stake until the legal wrangles are solved. Once that's cleared,
then we will try and clear the proposal quickly.''

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Enron plans asset sell-off to slash debt 


'We made some very bad investments,' Lay admits 

By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 

Enron Corp. officials admitted they made serious investment errors in recent years and will step up the pace of selling off those investments, including its broadband services group and some international operations.

Those business units, which are worth as much as $8 billion, could be sold off or spun out over the next year, the company said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. That would bring in more cash to pay down debt and trim away money-losing operations. 

Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay surprised many with a blunt assessment of the company's poor judgment in recent years that led to the rapid implosion of the energy trading giant's reputation and value in the past month. 

""In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,"" Lay said. ""The negative impact of these investments has been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet. We fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence."" 

To help make the cuts, the company is breaking its businesses into three groups: those that are the most profitable and part of its core business, such as energy and gas trading; those that are unprofitable and nonessential, such as overseas power plants; and those that have good profit potential in the near future that are under review, such as its steel, pulp and paper-trading operations. 

The noncore operations will be sold or closed down in an orderly fashion in the next year, said President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley. Those operations under review will be studied to see if they can contribute to the company's bottom line any time soon 

""These are businesses that have strong prospects and that we feel have good potential, but we'll need to look at each carefully,"" he said. 

The company's central businesses of energy and gas trading are not expected to be cut back significantly, Whalley said, and should remain intact until the merger. Despite reports that many employees are leaving those business groups, company officials have said repeatedly that is not the case and that top employees are being retained. A stipulation of the Dynegy-Enron merger agreement prevents Dynegy from recruiting or hiring Enron staff for a certain period, in case the purchase is not completed. 

The $8 billion in business units that could be sold in the coming year do not include Portland General Electric, the Oregon power company that was already under contract to sell for $2.9 billion next year. Nor do they include about $800 million in asset sales that are expected to close by year's end, Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said. That includes about $250 million for a Brazilian gas distribution business, $266 million for a power plant in Puerto Rico and $332 million for certain offshore energy properties in India. 

The company did not file a final version of its third-quarter financial statement Wednesday as previously expected but rather said it would be five days late with the document. Enron did, however, share some more details about some of its financing partnerships, including the Marlin and Osprey investment vehicles. 

Marlin is a vehicle created to acquire Azurix, an Enron unit that owns British water utility Wessex. It has over $900 million of debt that's due in July 2003. McMahon said that if the value of Wessex is 25 percent below its current book value of $2.6 billion when Marlin's debt falls due, this would result in a charge of $650 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Osprey was created to acquire energy assets and other assets, and has $2.4 billion of debt that falls due in January 2003. McMahon said that if the Osprey assets were valued at less than 25 percent of their current book value when the debt falls due it would result in a charge of $600 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Analysts asked repeatedly if executives were confident that no other surprise liabilities were hiding in the books, referring to the $1 billion in equity write-downs the company reported last quarter due to several off-balance-sheet financing deals, and a restatement of 4 1/2 years of financial statements to include an additional $600 million in losses. 

McMahon said the company has gone through the books carefully, but he noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission and a special committee of the Enron board of directors were still conducting their own investigations. 

""Everything we know, you now know,"" Lay told the analysts. 

Lay said the fourth-quarter results are expected to be hampered by severance and restructuring costs, however, but couldn't provide more details. He said the company is also seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity investments.

WSJ Says Enron Officials Knew About Chewco Partnership 

Top Enron executives, including Chairman Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, knew about the controversial partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing minutes from a November 5, 1997 meeting. Former CFO Andrew Fastow and several board members including external director Herbert Winokur Jr were also at the meeting that discussed Enron's partnership Chewco, named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca. Chewco, which was supposed to be completely independent, but was run and partly owned by Enron executive Michael Kopper, who also attended the meeting. Federal investigators and private litigants are trying to find out who knew what about Chewco and when. An attorney for Winokur says the executive committee was told that Chewco was a special-purpose vehicle not affiliated with the company. The board never waived the conflict-of-interest policy for Kopper nor was the board told that Kopper was involved with Chewco.

Lay Breaks Date with Congress After Report Issued

Enron attempted to systematically manipulate its financial results and deceive shareholders as top executives made personal gains of millions of dollars, according to William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School in testimony to be delivered before Congress yesterday. There was also failures in the performance of Enron's outside advisors. And there was a fundamental default of leadership and management, starting with former CEO Ken Lay and reaching to the board and senior managers. As Congress begins a week of hearings, the House Financial Services capital markets subcommittee also heard from SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt. Powers joined the Enron board to investigate events leading up to the company filing for bankruptcy on December 2nd. He has issued a 218-page report that found Enron fattened its profits by almost $1 billion through a web of financial partnerships used to hide losses, while top managers made millions of dollars they should never have received. ! He laid some of the blame for on Lay and of Jeffrey Skilling. Powers said former ex-Enron CFO Andrew Fastow made at least $30 million, while former senior executive Michael Kopper made at least $10 million through their involvement in off-the-books partnerships. Enrons board of directors failed in its duty to provide leadership and oversight and in the end, the tragedy could and should have been avoided, Powers said. After the report was released, Lay canceled plans to testify before a Senate committee and before the capital markets subcommittee.

AEP May Sell Some Foreign Assets 

American Electric Power may sell Seeboard, which serves 2 million power and natural gas users in the UK, and CitiPower, an Australian retail and distribution unit, to lower debt as it switches its focus to wholesale markets and away from household power supply. Like Reliant and Mirant, AEP is selling foreign assets to protect its credit ratings. Enrons bankruptcy has caused many energy companies to slash capital spending and sell assets to lower debt. AEP has $2.6 billion in debt maturing in the next 2 years. Seeboard is valued at about $2.1 billion and CitiPower at as much as $760 million. AEP, which acquired Seeboard in a $10 billion buyout of C&SW, said will consider all potential options for Seeboard. AEPs 4th quarter earnings fell 41% due to mild weather. It is selling common stock and convertible preferred shares to raise cash and shore up its balance sheet. Last year, AEP sold Yorkshire Power in the UK and purchased 2 power stations. AEP has also been expanding it! s energy trading business after Enrons collapse. It bought Enron's Scandinavian businesses and hired 22 coal traders from Enron. Seeboard is likely to fetch a good price since it is the only supply business for sale in the UK. E.ON, Electricite de France and Scottish & Southern Energy have been named as likely bidders for Seeboard. CitiPowers sale will probably happen in the 3rd quarter, according to AEP. Possible buyers could be Australian Gas Light, United Energy and Origin Energy. AEP bought the retail and distribution company for $1.1 billion in 1998.

Williams May Sell Midwest Oil Products Pipeline

Williams may sell its 8,000-mile Midwest oil products pipeline and storage depots for between $500 million and $1.5 billion, to help defray costs from possible exposure to $2.4 billion from Williams Communications. Last week, Williams postponed the release of 4th quarter results to review costs associated with Williams Communications Group, which was spun off in April. Williams said that those costs will be included in the 4th quarter earnings report. Williams Energy Partners which is 60% owned by Williams has been mentioned as a likely buyer for the pipeline. Williams has sold securities and cut capital spending to shore up its balance sheet amid heavier scrutiny by credit rating agencies following Enrons bankruptcy. Williams 7.5% coupon bonds maturing in 2031 were down about $44 to $879 per $1,000 face value from $923 last week, with the spread above US Treasuries climbing to 330 basis points from 285. None of the rating agencies has downgraded Williams debt yet, but S! ?has says it may lower Williams ratings because of concern about the company's finances. S?rates Williams BBB+, Moody's rates it Baa2 and Fitch rates it as BBB, all investment grade. Williams is aiming complete the Midwest pipeline sale by the end of the 2nd quarter.

Lay Makes Himself Scarce

A congressional committee trying to serve a subpoena on former Enron Chairman Ken Lay can not seem to locate him. His personal attorney does not know where he is and would not accept the subpoena. The House of Representatives Financial Services Committee finds the whole situation quiet puzzling. Lay's attorney says he is ill and has no idea where Lay is. Lay resigned from Enrons board yesterday as two congressional committees vowed to force him to come before them to testify or take the 5th Amendment. He had been scheduled to appear before a House Financial Services subcommittee, but backed out over the weekend. It had hoped to compel him to appear today. Lay had also been scheduled to appear before a Senate committee, but canceled that date also.

TRADERS DEBATE SHORT SIDE OF MARKET

Although Monday's price action on the New York Mercantile Exchange is perhaps best described as lackadaisical, some traders see inspiration to take the short side of the market where others are focusing on a longer term trend higher.  ""When the March contract expired (January 29), it got as low as $1.97 and developed a modest countertrend higher. As long as the market was able to continue trading above the previous day's low, that advance worked well,"" noted Dean Hazelcorn, trader with Coquest, Dallas.  ""Today looks like a sell signal. The high of the March contract did not exceed Friday's high and today's low was lower. That sets up a trade down to $1.97. I look for a slow deteriorating front end of the board,"" he noted.  ""I'm back in a bearish mode, and I think we're headed below $2.00. I believe that there is a 99% probability the market will work lower, but it may take 3 months to do it,"" he cautioned.  Other traders are more optimistic.  ""Longer ter! m I'm bullish,"" says John Beaver, President Private Futures Group, Oklahoma City.  ""It's more difficult to be bullish on the front of the board, but looking at the charts it suggests that prices may be set to rise.  There's a gap on the weekly chart between $2.17 and $2.20 on the weekly chart (week ending January 18, and January 25). and if prices could fill that gap, it would be a positive sign that prices were set to move higher,"" he said.  A gap is a pattern on the price charts followed by market technicians. The idea is that the gap may act as a barrier to (in this case) further price advances. Once the gap is ""filled"", however, a potential limitation to price advances has been removed and prices would be empowered to move higher.  ""I don't have any interest in being short the market at the $2.00 level. I don't want to be in a trade that may only make 10 or 15 cents and have to worry about it,"" he said.  ""If you are a commercial trader are you going to get short at $1.85! ? What is your board of directors going to say?""

Natural Gas Futures Drop on Technicals


    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX tumbled
$0.14 yesterday to $2.254 per MMBtu after locals battled funds and
lost. The March contract lost $0.109 to $2.254 per MMBtu. There was a
technical strategy from large marketing firms to bid up the contract
in an attempt to chase funds out of their short positions, however,
it blew up in their face. The locals wound up long and had to sell-
off rapidly. The market opened strong, hitting a high of $2.405 per
MMBtu on the strength of an AGA report that lowered the year-on-year
surplus, but then quickly dropped below $2.25. Open interest
increased by 9,689 contracts Wednesday to 464,452 contracts, in what
by yesterday morning indicated a contrived effort to sell up the
market. Look for resistance at $2.36 and support at $2.20, $2.125 and
$2.02. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada
generally flat to up $0.05 per MMBtu yesterday. Without much cold
weather moving either market, the spread between futures and cash
stayed at $0.03  $0.05 without much movement. Natural gas for next
day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.03 to $2.33 per MMBtu.

 PG&E Claims California Owes It Billions


    Pacific Gas & Electric has filed a $4.1 billion damage claim
against California for allegedly breaking a regulatory contract to
let it sell power at prices set by the FERC. The claim stems from the
1996 law that deregulated the state's power market and helped trigger
California's energy crisis. PG&E says that under the law, it agreed
to divest most of its in-state power plants to increase competition
in the local electricity market. In return, the state would allow
PG&E's remaining hydroelectric and nuclear plants to sell power at
market prices overseen by the FERC. That would end the California
PUCs authority to set prices, and shifting regulatory oversight to
FERC's less stringent system of managing prices. PG&E says the market
value of its power was not less than $4.1 billion. It also says that
under an emergency energy bill passed last January, the state broke
the agreement for FERC regulation. The state board has 45 days to
reply to the claim.

Westchester County, NY Battles Millennium Pipeline


    Westchester County, north of New York City, will petition the
FERC to reconsider its decision to permit Columbia Gas to build the
530-mile Millennium pipeline from Ontario to Mount Vernon, NY. The
pipeline would transport 700,000 Mcf per day to New York City and
southern parts of the state. The county alleges that the FERC
prematurely granted Columbias request to build the pipeline. They say
that Columbia does not have the needed state approvals to proceed
with construction and that the company did not provide crucial
information about using dynamite to blast in environmentally
sensitive areas in the Hudson River. A FERC study found that the
pipeline would have limited adverse environmental impact and was the
preferred alternative to deliver natural gas to New York. The
commission has 30 days to respond to the countys petition. If denied,
Westchester can then seek a court order to block construction. The
county has asked several state regulatory departments to deny future
approvals and cancel existing permits already granted. Westchester
will also refuse to grant Columbia permits for construction on county
land. Additionally, the county is questioning whether the pipeline
violates a state plan to protect coastal areas from environmental
damage. Federal law prohibits a federal agency from granting approval
for projects that affect the coastline if a state finds it violates
its own coastal plan. In addition, county officials have asked the
governor to intervene when he attends a FERC conference later this
month.

Enron Paid Very Few Taxes


    Enrons use of Caribbean tax havens to legally shelter profits
reflects the power Washington lobbyists have in creating tax havens
for the rich and powerful. Offshore tax havens among the small
islands of the Caribbean have been used for years by individual
investors, companies, drug traffickers and money launderers to hide
cash. But the disclosure that Enron paid no income taxes in 4 of the
last 5 years by using 900 subsidiaries in tax-haven countries and
other techniques kept its US tax bill a next to nothing. Enron used
881 subsidiaries abroad, including 692 in the Cayman Islands and 119
in the Turks and Caicos, and other legal tax-avoidance techniques
common to major companies to zero-out US tax bills. The Cayman
Islands, a tiny British colony of 35,000 residents just south of
Cuba, is one of the world's leading financial centers with some 600
banks and thousands of foreign corporations.

Andersen Memo Details Meeting on Enron


   A February 6, 2001 Andersen memo detailing a executive meeting
where the amount of debt kept off Enron's books was discussed has
surfaced. Andersen said the meeting was just a standard annual review
of Enron. The executives discussed whether Anderson should drop Enron
as a client, and also talked about how key the off balance sheet
transactions were to understanding the energy firms finances. It has
also been revealed that Andersen was warned of trouble at Enron last
summer by the same executive who sent Kenneth Lay a memo detailing 
her concerns over the companys financial practices. The Enron
executive then raised those same concerns in a conversation with an
unidentified Andersen partner. Andersen was assured by Enron that an
outside law firm had been hired to look into the allegations. The
memo is likely to lead to questions about the role of accountants and
the steps they take before signing sign off on a company's financial
statements. The chairman of the SEC is expected to announce a new
accounting oversight panel to include accountants and non-
accountants, possibly similar to the Public Oversight Board.

Recession and Mild Weather Lower Dukes Profits


    Duke says 4th quarter profits dropped 21% due to lower energy
prices, mild weather and the recession. Earnings fell to $225
million, or $0.28 per share, from $284 million, or $0.38 a year ago.
Revenue was off 30% to $10.7 billion from $15.4 billion the year
before. Duke's field services unit, which processes natural gas
liquids saw its earnings tumble 34% because of lower prices. The
companys electric utilities, which provided more than 30% of its
earnings, fell 41% as moderate temperatures and a drop in industrial
demand ate into power sales. Dukes power sales slid 7.6% in the
quarter for residential customers and 9.5% for industrial customers,
the company said. Natural gas prices plunged 59% from a year earlier
and wholesale power prices in Dukes service region fell by 50% to
about $25 per MWh. Duke also said that it took a charge for special
items totaling  $46 million, or $0.06 per share, to reflect
accounting adjustments at its utilities and exposure to losses from
dealings with Enron. Excluding the one-time charge, profit was $271
million, or $0.34 per share. The average of analysts estimates was
$0.45 per share. The company remains optimistic that it can achieve
10% - 15% growth this year. Duke's revenue last year was $59.5
billion compared to $49.3 billion in 2000. More than half of its
natural gas and power contracts hedged through 2004.

ISO Merger Talks Continue in Northeast and Midwest

   Merger talks are underway in the Northeast and Midwest to
consolidate control of large parts of those grids. The New York ISO
is in discussions with ISO New England to form a regional
transmission organization between the two grid operators. The talks
currently do not include the PJM Interconnection, which last week
announced that it reached a letter of intent to create a single
market with the Midwest ISO. The FERC has a pending decision on
Northeastern RTO formation, based on confidential mediation
discussions from last summer that were aimed at developing a business
plan to create a single Northeast RTO. It expects to release the
results of its own cost-benefit analysis of forming a single
Northeastern RTO next month, but has not decided on the size and
numbers of RTOs in the region. Also, former members of the Alliance
RTO are in negotiations to form an independent entity within the
existing Midwest ISO. The discussions concern a FERC rulemaking
session last month that declared the Midwest ISO to be the single RTO
for the region, saying that the Alliance did not meet its conditions.

Accenture Now Glad Andersen Name Lost

   About a year ago consulting firm Accenture was called Andersen
Consulting, but lost a bitter fight with its sister firm, Arthur
Andersen, to retain the brand name of Andersen. Now, the name loss
looks like manna from Heaven, as the once fabled Andersen name sinks
in the Enron quagmire. Once one of the pillars of accounting, the
Andersen name is now only associated with the Enron debacle. That is
very different from the scenario that prevailed during the bitter
battle between the accounting firm and its consulting arm. A Paris
mediator ruled in Andersen's favor in August 2000. That was a seen as
a huge victory for the accounting firm. The dispute began when
Andersen Consulting, which had seen its profits soar with the booming
economy, felt it was not being paid enough for its work. Ultimately,
Andersen Consulting won independence, but was forced it to relinquish
the Andersen brand name. Be careful what you ask for, you might not
really want it after all.

Canadian Drilling to Drop this Year

    The Petroleum Services Association of Canada says that Western
Canadian producers expect to cut drilling by 26% this year and
natural gas will continue to dominate exploration activity. It
predicts 13,386 wells will be drilled in western Canada, down from
last year's record 18,024. Natural gas will account for 8,189, or
61%, of its forecast well completions this year. PSAC expects 10,309
wells to be drilled in Alberta, down 26% from 2001; 2,323 wells in
Saskatchewan, a 25% drop; and 674 in northeastern British Columbia,
down 29%. There were 11,177 natural gas completions last year in the
Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, with another 26 natural gas wells
drilled in the East Coast offshore.

"FROM RAYMOND BOWEN, JR., EVP, FINANCE & TREASURER","To:		All Enron Employees

From:	Raymond Bowen, Jr.
		EVP, Finance & Treasurer

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

"Organizational Announcement","
As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

I am currently planning on having Dave run the west risk desk,  and leaving O over Texas.  So I just want to make sure that we are still on the same page with Dave coming back down here.  If not,  I need to make some changes to the organization.

Thanks

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Enron's Lay Turns Down Severance Pay
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp. said its chairman, Kenneth Lay, has decided to forgo a severance payment of $60.6 million that could be triggered by Dynegy Inc.'s planned acquisition of Enron. Mr. Lay's decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice. 
Early in the day, an Enron filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission laid out Mr. Lay's severance package. By midday, Enron indicated that Mr. Lay would keep only one-third of the payout, which he would take in stock in the combined company, and that he intended to donate one-third to a foundation to help displaced Enron employees. The remaining third would cover income-tax liabilities.
But by the end of the day, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said that Mr. Lay, following a meeting of Enron energy traders, had decided against taking any of the severance pay. Though Mr. Lay didn't attend the traders' meeting, senior managers told him that ""opinions were expressed that he shouldn't receive the payment,"" Mr. Palmer said. ""He decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment."" The opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of Enron's profits. Questions for Mr. Lay were directed to Mr. Palmer, who said he had spoken with Mr. Lay and other company officials during the day. 
The initial disclosure about Mr. Lay's hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell Enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago. Last Friday, Mr. Lay even said that Enron had other options to the Dynegy purchase, which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent, though he declined to elaborate. ""Things weren't desperate . . . we had alternatives,"" Mr. Lay said. The 59-year-old Mr. Lay won't have an executive position at the combined company, though he might be a director. 
For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million through the exercise of Enron options, according to disclosure reports compiled by Thomson Financial. Last year, Mr. Lay was paid $8.3 million in salary and bonus and more than $10 million in stock awards and other compensation. 
Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company's extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers. Those dealings are under investigation by the SEC. Last Friday, Enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller Houston-based Dynegy for stock, currently valued at about $10.7 billion. The merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies. 
Separately, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which owns about three million Enron and 500,000 Dynegy shares, said it would oppose the appointment of any current Enron board member to the board of a combined company. Michael Flaherman, chair of CalPERS investment committee said that it appeared that Enron's board ""failed in its responsibility"" to monitor the activities of Enron executives. 
Mr. Palmer, the Enron spokesman, said Mr. Lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from 1989 forward. In February 2000, when Enron stock was trading between $60 and $70 a share and Mr. Lay was being widely lauded for his performance, he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously. Last August, when Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling quit unexpectedly, Mr. Lay assumed Mr. Skilling's duties and his contract term was extended by two years to Dec. 31, 2005. 
Under the terms of his contract, Mr. Lay is entitled to payment of $20.2 million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract, in the event that his employment terminates within 60 days of a change in control. Thus, Mr. Lay is entitled to three full years of payments, or $60.6 million. 
Mr. Lay, who took charge of the then-Houston Natural Gas Co. in 1984 when it was a regional pipeline company, wasn't the only member of his family to benefit from Enron's heady rise to a global energy giant. SEC filings show that in recent years a sister of Mr. Lay, Sharon Lay, and a son, Mark Lay, received millions of dollars in salary, commissions and bonuses related to Ms. Lay's travel agency and a paper-products company connected to the younger Mr. Lay. 
Mr. Palmer said it is a ""cheap shot"" to criticize the Lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements. ""The contracts were bid out and fairly awarded,"" Mr. Palmer said. Ms. Lay said her travel agency, of which she is president and half-owner, had won its Enron business through competitive bidding and by providing ""the very best service possible."" Mark Lay couldn't be reached for comment. 
Coming on top of disclosures of Enron's dealings with partnerships run by its own executives, the relationships between Lay family members and the company again raise questions about Enron's willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests. Former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and possibly other Enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships. 
Mark Lay's dealings with Enron date back to 1994, according to the available SEC filings. In May 1997, Mark Lay and ""certain other individuals"" who together had been officers, directors or shareholders of a company called Paper & Print Management Corp., or PPMC, entered into employment agreements with an Enron unit, Enron Capital & Trade Resources, according to Enron's 1998 proxy statement. The individuals helped set up ""a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products,"" according to the SEC filing. Mr. Palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of Enron's profitable paper and pulp-trading business. 
As part of the deal, Enron agreed to reimburse PPMC $1 million for certain expenses. Mark Lay and his colleagues also agreed to ""convey"" to Enron ""certain intangible property rights"" from PPMC. 
Mark Lay also got a three-year employment contract from Enron as a vice president of Enron Capital & Trade. He got a signing bonus of $100,000, a minimum monthly salary of $12,500, a minimum annual bonus of $100,000 for 1997-1999 and an option to purchase 20,000 Enron shares. Mark Lay is no longer with Enron and is now attending a seminary, said Mr. Palmer. 
Since 1985, Sharon Lay's firm, Lay/Wittenberg Travel Agency in the Park Inc., has provided travel arrangements for employees of Enron and its predecessor company. For this work the agency received $6.8 million from 1996 through 2000. In an interview yesterday, Ms. Lay said Enron accounted for more than half of her firm's revenue in some years. She said her brother's position was ""more a problem"" than an asset since it led some to assume she hadn't worked hard enough to get Enron's business.

Inside Track
Enron CEO Cut Stakes in Firms Where He Sits in Director's Seat
By Cassell Bryan-Low
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Kenneth L. Lay, Enron Corp.'s embattled chairman and chief executive, in recent weeks has cashed in nearly $2 million of shares in companies at which he sits on the board. 
Mr. Lay, 59 years, sold $1.2 million of shares, or more than a quarter of his holdings, of Compaq Computer Corp., where he has been a director for 14 years. In his first sale of the Houston-based company's shares since 1999, he disposed of 124,596 shares Oct. 29 for $9.25 each, leaving him with a 340,724 share stake. Apart from two directors who resigned, he is the only Compaq insider to have sold shares this year.
The sale comes as the computer company awaits completion of its planned merger with Hewlett-Packard Co. -- a deal the board has repeatedly said it supports. In a Nov. 7 news release, the board, including Mr. Lay, said it ""reaffirmed its strong support for the proposed merger."" A day earlier, H-P's founding Hewlett family, which controls 5% of H-P stock, said it intended to oppose the merger, throwing the deal's future into uncertainty. Compaq shares traded at $8.80, up $1.14, as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. 
The sale, Mr. Lay said, wasn't related to his views on the merger. ""It's no negative [reflection] on Compaq,"" he said. Mr. Lay, who also sold shares of drug maker Eli Lilly & Co., where he has been a director since 1993, said of both sales, ""I needed to have a little more liquidity."" 
On Oct. 31, he sold 10,000 shares of Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, representing roughly a 16% reduction of his holdings, at prices of $77.55 and $77.56 a share, or $775,550 total. That figure is $34,250 above what he paid for the same number of shares Feb. 20 at $74.13 each. After the sale, Mr. Lay owned 54,528 Eli Lilly shares. 
Eli Lilly shares traded at $78.97, up 75 cents, on the NYSE yesterday. Eli Lilly had no comment on the sales, and Compaq spokesman Arch Currid said, ""We don't comment on the personal financial transactions of board members."" 
Mr. Lay also noted that much of his net worth is tied up in Enron, shares of which tumbled by as much as 80% during the past several weeks alone. Enron shocked investors Oct. 16 when it announced a third-quarter loss of $618 million. The Houston energy company has since announced huge write-offs of assets, reductions of shareholder equity, major downward restatements of past earnings reports; and it has disclosed a regulatory probe into its complex transactions with off-balance-sheet partnerships. Shares have recovered some ground since Friday's announcement by Dynegy Inc., a rival Houston independent power producer, of plans to acquire Enron. Shares of Enron traded at $9.98, up 74 cents, or 8%, on the Big Board as of 4 p.m. 
As previously reported, Mr. Lay sold $25.7 million of his Enron shares this year, as the stock fell from about $78 to under $44, and his remaining stake is valued at about $28 million. For 2000, he earned a salary of $1.3 million, a bonus of $7 million, plus $7.5 million in Enron restricted stock and other benefits, including use of a personal plane, according to Enron's proxy statement. 
Mr. Lay, who was Enron's CEO from 1985 until February of this year, resumed the post after his successor, Jeffrey Skilling, stepped down in August after only six months on the job. At that time, Mr. Lay agreed to stay on through 2005, but his employment agreement provides for a lump-sum payment under a change of control, such as the proposed merger with Dynegy, according to a regulatory document filed yesterday. The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Mr. Lay would be entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment within 60 days of the merger. In addition, Mr. Lay is entitled to an amount for any related tax penalties if the payment was deemed to constitute an ""excess parachute payment,"" the filing said. 
Mr. Lay also serves on the board of EOTT Energy Corp. -- the general partner of EOTT Energy Partners LP -- and NewPower Holdings Co. 
Mr. Lay also recently sold his stake in i2 Technologies Inc., according to his spokesman, following Mr. Lay's resignation from the board of that company Oct. 25 after serving for a year. As of March 2001, he owned 13,000 shares of the Dallas business-software company, a stake that would have been valued at about $64,000 at the time he resigned.

THE MARKETS: Market Place
Enron Chief Will Give Up Severance
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and FLOYD NORRIS

11/14/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Trying to quell a furious reaction from employees outraged that he stood to profit from a merger with Dynegy Inc., Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman and chief executive of the Enron Corporation, decided late yesterday to give up a severance package worth more than $60 million. 
The tumult at Enron's headquarters in Houston began after the company disclosed in a securities filing earlier in the day that Mr. Lay was in line to collect $60.6 million in pay after the deal closed next year, $20.2 million for every full calendar year left in his employment contract.
Mr. Lay had been a popular leader as Enron grew in the last 15 years from a pipeline operator into the nation's largest energy trader, a business largely of his invention. Employees shared in the gains, though none gained as much as Mr. Lay, who has collected more than $300 million since 1989, mostly through exercising stock options. 
But the value of employees' stock options and their 401(k) accounts evaporated this fall as Enron shares plummeted amid concerns over the company's accounting practices. And traders and other workers started the day yesterday gossiping angrily about Mr. Lay's severance package. 
Then, at an afternoon meeting of employees in the company's core natural gas and electricity trading operation, which provides by far the biggest part of Enron's profits, ''quite a bit of concern was raised about the news people had been seeing about this change-of-control payment,'' Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said. 
At about 4 p.m. Central time, two senior executives who had attended the meeting, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen, told Mr. Lay about the reaction of employees. ''Ken made a decision shortly thereafter that the best thing to do would be to waive the payment altogether,'' Mr. Palmer said. Even if Dynegy's directors later voted to award Mr. Lay a new severance agreement, he would turn it down, Mr. Palmer added. 
''What Ken said is that this is the absolute cleanest way to remove any doubts, that he was not going to profit as a result of this change of control,'' Mr. Palmer said. ''This issue was causing enough concern among employees that he wanted to deal with it.'' 
Severance pay had been an awkward matter for Mr. Lay in the last week. The only reason that Enron was being acquired -- putting the severance clauses in his employment contract into effect -- were the financial problems that have occurred on his watch. The company's shares have lost almost 90 percent of their value after peaking in the summer of 2000. 
During merger discussions last week, Mr. Lay told Dynegy's chairman, Charles L. Watson, that he wanted to rework the severance package, Mr. Palmer said. On Monday, Mr. Watson disclosed that Mr. Lay wanted much of the severance to be in the form of stock options. 
By yesterday afternoon, Enron officials were saying that Mr. Lay planned to take two-thirds of the severance in stock or other noncash compensation. And, they said, he wanted to give half of that amount, or one-third of his total package, to establish a charitable foundation to benefit Enron employees. 
It was about an hour later that Enron said Mr. Lay would give up the severance entirely. 
Mr. Lay has not decided whether to accept an invitation to be on the board of the combined company, which will be called Dynegy. 
The deal could still fall victim to antitrust objections or disclosures of further financial problems at Enron. 
Whether Mr. Lay's gesture will placate Enron's traders, who are now deluging other energy-trading companies with resumes, remains to be seen. Dynegy is known as a much more conservative firm than Enron, and analysts renewed their concerns yesterday about the cultural clash draining the talent, and value, from the combined company. 
''So much of their top talent is going out the door, I don't know what Dynegy gets,'' said a senior executive at another rival firm. 
The stunning near-collapse of Enron -- bankruptcy was only averted, some analysts say, by the Dynegy acquisition -- closes a chapter on one of the most influential careers in the history of the energy business. 
The ugly circumstances of Enron's downfall, including the revelation that partnerships were used to move debt off the company's balance sheet and that Enron overstated profits in the last five years by almost $600 million, have left Mr. Lay's reputation in tatters. 
Just months ago, Mr. Lay was widely hailed -- or decried, in some circles -- as the genius behind energy deregulation. His friend, George W. Bush, had been elected president, and policies favored by Enron were front and center in the administration's energy policy. Mr. Lay retired from day-to-day management, making plans to pursue new business interests. 
But he again assumed the chief executive's post at Enron in August, after the unexpected resignation of his handpicked successor, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and the accounting problems swiftly unfolded in the weeks that followed. On Monday, Mr. Lay said he might revive the business plans he set aside during the summer, but he declined to say what those plans were. 
Even without the severance package, Mr. Lay has become enormously wealthy running Enron. 
All told, from 1989 through this year, Mr. Lay collected about $13 million in salary (his exact salary for this year is not known) and $26.8 million in cash bonuses. But those sums were dwarfed by the $266.7 million in profits that he received in selling stock. 
The bulk of his income from exercising options came in the last four years: $13.1 million in 1998, $43.9 million in 1999, $123.4 million in 2000 and $20.7 million this year -- a year in which he sold stock by prearrangement on every trading day through July 31, and then stopped, not wanting to appear to be selling as the stock price was declining. 
The options he has cashed in recent years, as well as those he now owns, are badly out of the money at Enron's current stock price of $9.98, down from a peak reached in 2000 of $90.75. 
His bonus in 2000 was $7 million, an award that Enron's board said was based on the company's rising profits and high shareholder return. The company restated those profits last week, explaining that it had improperly applied accounting rules. It said that about 40 percent of its profit in 2000 came from transactions with partnerships that were controlled by Andrew S. Fastow, who was then Enron's chief financial officer. 
The company's stock price, which was in free fall after questions about the Fastow partnerships prompted an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, fell to $7 a share in the wake of the disclosures. That was the lowest price for the stock since 1991. It rebounded to nearly $10 after Dynegy agreed to acquire the company in a stock swap. 
In January, Enron's board awarded another bonus to Mr. Lay, of $3.6 million. That was based entirely on the company's shareholder return from 1997 through 2000, which came to 294 percent, the company said. All of that return has since been wiped out. 
Also in January, Mr. Lay was awarded 106,578 shares of restricted stock, to vest periodically through 2004. All the shares will now vest when the Dynegy deal is completed, and while their value has plunged, the award is still worth more than $1 million. 
Still, Mr. Lay suffered huge paper losses this year. 
At the end of 2000, he had 5.1 million options that could have been exercised for profits of $257.5 million, and another 1.5 million options that would have been worth another $104.1 million when enough time had passed that they could be exercised -- assuming the share price stayed level. He exercised 565,928 of those options this year, making a profit of $20.7 million, but the ones he did not exercise are now under water.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Regulators face new boundaries in Enron deal.
By NANCY DUNNE and PETER SPIEGEL.

11/14/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Regulators wading into the competitive landscape following Dynegy's offer to buy Enron will be scrutinising a new industry where traditional yardsticks like market definition and barriers to entry have yet to be determined. This will make gaining approval of the $10bn deal an uncertain and complicated task, experts said. 
Dynegy and Enron have insisted the merger, which will combine the largest energy trading company in the world with one of its largest competitors, will be approved by federal regulators without significant conditions or divestitures.
But competition lawyers said this week that because the market for energy trading is so new - indeed, it was all but created by Enron in the 1990s - that federal agencies will have to spend months finding out how rivals compete in order to develop guidelines to measure the merger's impact. 
""We don't have any track record here,"" said Ernest Gellhorn, an antitrust expert at George Mason University. 
The deal will be reviewed by state and federal agencies, but the most critical approvals will come from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and US antitrust agencies. 
Central to the antitrust review will be how competition authorities define the market - how big it is, which companies are included as competitors, and how the market share is divided up. 
Former antitrust officials said Enron might be forced to resort to a ""failing firm"" defence, which is occasionally used by companies with large market shares when attempting to add to their dominant position. 
But Robert McTamaney, an antitrust partner at Carter Ledyard & Milburn, said the failing-firm route may be difficult for Dynegy and Enron to prove, since it requires a showing that without the merger, Enron's trading business would exit the market completely. 
Helping the companies, however, is the relative ease with which competitors can enter the trading market, experts said. 
An analysis of barriers will hinge on whether rivals can successfully argue that the level of expertise in the industry is so sophisticated - or that Enron's trading technologies are so specialised - that it would be impossible for new entrants to duplicate the company's operations. 
Dynegy executives said they expect more scrutiny from FERC, though it rarely rejects mergers, and its guidelines put an emphasis on speed of reviews.

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS: Enron chief will turn down Dollars 60m takeover windfall 
Financial Times; Nov 14, 2001
By SHEILA MCNULTY and PETER THAL LARSEN

Ken Lay, the chairman and chief executive of Enron, is set to turn down a Dollars 60.6m pay-off to which he was entitled following the troubled power group's takeover by Dynegy.
Mr Lay, who oversaw Enron's rapid rise and its subsequent collapse and sale to Dynegy, was due the payment under an employment contract he extended when he resumed full control of the company in August 2001.
However Mr Lay decided yesterday after meeting with some Enron employees that he would turn down the payment.
""Ken Lay will not accept the Dollars 60m when he leaves,"" an Enron spokeswoman said. ""He felt like it was not the right thing to do.""
According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr Lay is entitled to Dollars 20.2m in cash for every remaining year in his employment contract if he leaves Enron within 60 days of the company being taken over.
Mr Lay's decision is in sharp contrast to other senior US executives who have negotiated - and accepted - ""golden parachutes"" which guarantee them large payments even if they oversaw large-scale destruction in shareholder value.
Mr Lay had previously come under fire from shareholders for selling some of his Enron shareholding before the collapse in the company's stock price. Between January and July this year, he sold Enron shares with an estimated value of more than Dollars 27.5m.
At the close of trading yesterday Enron was valued at Dollars 7.5bn, compared with a peak of Dollars 65.9bn in August last year.
The terms were part of Mr Lay's original employment contract, which had been due to expire in December 2003. But in August, following the sudden departure of chief executive Jeff Skilling, Enron's board extended Mr Lay's contract by two years.
At the time, the contract extension was seen as an attempt by Mr Lay to restore investor confidence in the company. But it also ensured he would receive an additional Dollars 40.4m if he left following a sale.
After the Dollars 10.8bn Dynegy takeover, Mr Lay is expected to give up his executive responsibilities. He may join the combined group's board of directors but this will not affect his eligibility for a pay-off. The deal, which requires the approval of US competition authorities, is expected to be completed next year.

Enron Chief Relinquishes Severance Pay

Enron Corp. Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay on Tuesday waived a severance payment of at least $60 million due him when Dynegy Inc. completes its expected acquisition of Enron next year, company officials said. 
The potential payment, disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory filing Tuesday, would undoubtedly have sparked additional controversy, given Lay's primary role in the sharp fall of Enron's stock and worsening financial condition, which led to the Dynegy deal.
The payment would have been one of the biggest rewards for failure in corporate history, said Graef Crystal, a leading compensation expert. 
The payment would have topped the nearly $40 million Mattel Inc. paid former Chief Executive Jill Barad after she was ousted in 2000 after spending $3.6 billion to purchase a money-losing software business the company eventually gave away to a technology group in return for a slice of future profit. 
It would have been almost double the $35 million in severance collected by former Xerox Corp. Chief Executive Richard Thoman when he was fired in May 2000 after a disastrous reorganization of the copier company's sales force. 
According to Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne, Lay spoke to a number of employees Tuesday and ""decided that the best course of action would be for him to waive his right to payment."" 
""Instead,"" Denne said, ""the combined company would decide the best use of those funds."" 
Lay and Enron have run into a storm of criticism in recent weeks after the disclosure of a series of partnerships and the dismissal of several top executives who invested in those ventures. 
News of the partnerships and their losses forced the Houston-based company to restate its earnings last week, reducing corporate profits over the last four years by $586 million, or about 20%, to $2.3billion. 
Shareholders have filed a series of lawsuits against Enron, charging the company with failing to disclose key information about its operations and financial structure. 
The negative disclosures sparked a cash crunch and threatened Enron with collapse until it was saved by an agreement Friday to be acquired by Houston-based Dynegy for $9 billion. 
Shareholders have watched the value of Enron shares decline almost 90% from a high of nearly $90 on Aug. 23, 2000. Its shares closed Tuesday at $9.98, up 74cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
CEO Already Reaped 
$150 Million in Options 
According to the regulatory filing, Lay stood to collect $20.2 million a year, plus certain extraordinary tax expenses, for each of the full years remaining on his contract once the company was acquired. 
If the Dynegy deal is completed as expected next year, Lay's payment would have totaled at least $60.6 million. His contract ends on Dec. 31, 2005. 
Lay already reaped about $150million in stock option gains the last two years alone. Those gains were in part made possible by rosy Enron profit statements, which the company restated downward last week, Crystal said. 
""It is a good move to waive the payment,"" Crystal said. ""But that's just the down payment on what he should give back. There is probably another $100 million in option profits he should give back. Had they correctly stated the books, the stock would not have risen as high and he would not have made as much from exercising his stock options in the company."" 
A stock option gives the holder the right to purchase a share of a company at a predetermined price. Options are a common executive pay incentive, allowing the individual to purchase and sell the shares, pocketing the gains in their appreciation. Lay made $123 million off such transactions last year and $26 million this year, Crystal said. 
Lay since 1989 has had a ""change of control"" clause that awards him a special payment if Enron changes hands. The company described the clause as a standard part of executive employment agreements common to many companies. 
Some Wall Street analysts said the liability for the payment would be Dynegy's problem at the point the merger is completed. Enron shareholders already have suffered all the damage they are going to see. 
""Enron has clearly lost the vast majority of its shareholders over the last six months with its piecemeal disclosure, destruction of shareholder value and loss of credibility,"" said Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities in New York. 
John Sousa, a spokesman for Dynegy, said the company was aware of the severance clause and had factored the expense into its acquisition, which ""we believe is a very strong financial transaction"" regardless of the potential payment to Lay.

Enron CEO Says No to $60.6 Million

Kenneth Lay, chairman and chief executive of Enron Corp., decided yesterday to forgo an expected $60.6 million severance payment because of the impact of Enron's plunging stock price on the company's employees, a spokesman said. 
Until yesterday, Lay was preparing to accept the severance payout, which would be triggered at the completion of Enron's purchase by rival Houston energy company Dynegy Inc., a deal announced on Friday. Enron faced a cash crisis after disclosing it has overstated its earnings by $586 million over the past four years because of improper accounting treatment of its investments in outside partnerships that were managed by its chief financial officer.
The severance package was reported yesterday by Bloomberg News, which included a blistering comment by Andrew Whalley, manager of a trust that sold $5 million in Enron stock in April because of concerns with Enron's financial reports, Bloomberg said. 
Whalley called the settlement ""a ridiculous amount of money"" to pay the chairman of a company that suffered ""a textbook financial collapse, where he obviously had some knowledge of what was going on."" 
Enron spokesman Karen Denne said around midafternoon yesterday that Lay intended to donate one-third of the severance to Enron employees, keep one-third and use the remainder to pay taxes on the entire package. Lay, who built Enron into the world's largest energy trading company, was entitled to a payment of $20.2 million multiplied by each year remaining on his employment contract if it was terminated before it expires at the end of 2005. The purchase by Dynegy is expected to close in 2002, assuming regulatory approvals are forthcoming, giving Lay three years of payments. Lay said last week that he will retire once the deal is done. 
Denne checked again with Lay later in the afternoon and was told that he had decided not to accept any of the severance payment after a meeting yesterday with Enron employees. ""He realized this was extremely sensitive given the financial condition of Enron employees,"" Denne said. 
Many Enron employees hold the company's stock in savings and retirement plans, and the stock price has fallen from a high of $90 a share in August 2000 to a low of $8.41 last Thursday. 
Enron's price has picked up since the purchase announcement, closing at $9.98 yesterday. Dynegy has agreed to pay $23 billion for Enron, about $10 billion of that in stock (about $10 a share, when the deal was announced), while assuming Enron debt for the rest. 
Lay's compensation was increased nearly threefold, to $18.3 million, last year, when the company's annual revenue reached $100 billion and its stock hit an all-time high. 
Lay realized a gain of $123.4 million from exercising stock options last year. He is entitled to purchase 782,830 shares of Enron stock over the next seven years through stock options, according to a company filing, but those grants currently are worthless because of the collapse of Enron's stock price.

Greenspan takes on energy at Rice award presentation 
By SHANNON BUGGS 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The audience assembled at Rice University Tuesday evening may have wanted a briefing from the world's most influential economist about the U.S. strategy for combating a recession. 
What they got was Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's assessment of the market forces and technology shaping the oil and gas industries. 
Greenspan, chairman of the Fed since 1988, came to Houston to accept the Baker Institute's Enron Prize for Distinguished Public Service. Previous award recipients include Nelson Mandela, former president of South Africa; Mikhail Gorbachev, former president of the Soviet Union; and Colin Powell, U.S. secretary of state. 
However, Greenspan declined the cash and crystal sculpture that accompany the prize. 
It's logical that Greenspan talked about energy, considering the award is named for an energy trading company, the institute is researching energy supply and security issues, and the home of the institute is the world's energy capital. 
""As we, as economic policymakers, understandably focus on the impact of the tragedy of Sept. 11 and the further weakening of the economy that followed those events, it is essential that we do not lose sight of the policies needed to ensure long-term economic growth,"" Greenspan said. 
""One of the most important objectives of those policies should be an assured availability of energy. That imperative has, if anything, been elevated by the heightened tensions in the Middle East -- an area that harbors two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves."" 
Greenspan reviewed the nation's experiences with seesawing energy prices and episodes of imbalances in supply and demand. He also discussed technologies to augment energy supplies, including coal mining, nuclear power and fusion power. 
""Energy issues present policymakers and citizens with difficult decisions and trade-offs to make outside the market process; as always, national security and environmental concerns need to be addressed in setting policy,"" Greenspan said. 
At the end of the speech, Greenspan answered pre-selected written queries from the audience of students, faculty and invited guests. One questioner asked if the state of economy caused Greenspan to second-guess his monetary policies. 
Greenspan rephrased the question as to whether or not he had made a mistake. After much rhetoric, he in effect said no. 
""The notion that people have that monetary policy changes one little notch and the economy goes up, clearly has never been the case and is not the case today,"" Greenspan said. 
The evening ended with James Baker, former U.S. secretary of state and of the treasury, and Ken Lay, head of Enron, presenting Greenspan with the award. 
Rice University officials said it's premature to know whether the name of the Enron Prize will be changed if the sale of Enron to Dynegy is completed. 
Lay indicated the award would live on when he said, ""I'm looking forward to our first woman recipient."" 


USA: Enron's Lay says no to hefty pay package.
By Andrew Kelly

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Enron Corp chairman Ken Lay has turned down the chance to cash in on his company's financial troubles by refusing to accept a $60 million payment due him if a proposed buyout by power-trading rival Dynegy Inc goes through, a company spokeswoman said on Tuesday. 
He decided it was not right to take the money under the circumstances now confronting the company, Enron spokeswoman Anne Denne said.
Enron, the nation's top trader of gas and electricity, agreed on Friday to be bought by the much-smaller Dynegy in a stock swap worth about $9 billion after a controversy over questionable business deals had sapped its finances to the point of near-collapse. 
""After having discussions with employees today he decided that this is the right thing to do and he's going to leave it up to the combined company to determine the best use of that money,"" Denne told Reuters. 
Lay's contract, which runs through 2005, calls for him to get $20.2 million for each full year left in his contract if Enron is taken over by another company. Enron and Dynegy officials have said they expect to complete their merger by the third quarter of next year. 
Denne said the clause, which is known in corporate circles as a ""golden parachute,"" has been in his contract since 1989 and is a ""standard provision"" for chief executives. 
Denne said Lay told Enron employees of his decision in a company-wide e-mail. 
Enron has been under the gun from Wall Street since mid-October when it said shareholder equity had been cut $1.2 billion because of off-the-balance sheet deals with partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into the transactions, which sent Enron's stock and credit ratings into a tailspin and drained its cash as trading partners refused to extend credit. 
On Friday, Enron and Dynegy said they had agreed to merge at what seemed a firesale price for Enron, which last year had $100 billion in revenues and $1 billion in earnings. 
Also, on Tuesday night, Lay presented the Enron Prize for Distinguished Public Service to Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in an event at Rice University in Houston. Previous winners have included the likes of Nelson Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev. 
Prior to accepting the award, Greenspan told students that the most important thing for anyone in the business world was to be ethical. 
""I don't deny that there is an extraordinary amount of activity in the business community which is less than exemplary...but the best chance you have of making a big success in this world is to decide from square one that you're going to do it ethically,"" he said.

Enron Chairman Lay Decides to Forgo $60.6 Million Severance Payment

11/14/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. said its chairman, Kenneth Lay, has decided to forgo a severance payment of $60.6 million that could be triggered by Dynegy Inc.'s planned acquisition of Enron, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
Mr. Lay's decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice.
Early in the day, an Enron filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission laid out Mr. Lay's severance package. By midday, Enron indicated that Mr. Lay would keep only one-third of the payout, which he would take in stock in the combined company, and that he intended to donate one-third to a foundation to help displaced Enron employees. The remaining third would cover income-tax liabilities. 
But by the end of the day, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said that Mr. Lay, following a meeting of Enron energy traders, had decided against taking any of the severance pay. Though Mr. Lay didn't attend the traders' meeting, senior managers told him that ""opinions were expressed that he shouldn't receive the payment,"" Mr. Palmer said. ""He decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment."" The opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of Enron's profits. Questions for Mr. Lay were directed to Mr. Palmer, who said he had spoken with Mr. Lay and other company officials during the day. 
The initial disclosure about Mr. Lay's hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell Enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago. Last Friday, Mr. Lay even said that Enron had other options to the Dynegy purchase, which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent, though he declined to elaborate. ""Things weren't desperate . . . we had alternatives,"" Mr. Lay said. The 59-year-old Mr. Lay won't have an executive position at the combined company, though he might be a director. 
For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million through the exercise of Enron options, according to disclosure reports compiled by Thomson Financial. Last year, Mr. Lay was paid $8.3 million in salary and bonus and more than $10 million in stock awards and other compensation. 
Enron (ENE), the nation's largest energy trader, saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the company's extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers. Those dealings are under investigation by the SEC. Friday, Enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) for stock, currently valued at about $10.7 billion. The merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies. 
Separately, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which owns about three million Enron and 500,000 Dynegy shares, said it would oppose the appointment of any current Enron board member to the board of a combined company. Michael Flaherman, chair of CalPERS investment committee said that it appeared that Enron's board ""failed in its responsibility"" to monitor the activities of Enron executives.

Enron chairman says he won't take dlrs 60 million compensation package if Dynegy deal closes
By KRISTEN HAYS
Associated Press Writer

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. Chairman Ken Lay turned down up to dlrs 60.6 million that he stood to receive once the nation's top buyer and seller of natural gas is merged into its smaller, but stronger rival Dynegy Inc. 
""He has told the employees that he has given a lot of thought to this over the last few days and in light of the circumstances surrounding the company and after listening to the employees he has decided the best thing to do is waive his right to the payment,"" Enron spokesman Vance Meyer said.
Lay decided it best to forego the Enron compensation package after consulting with employees Tuesday. He let those who work for him know of his decision via voicemail. 
Meyer said the compensation package was the only merger-related payment Lay was eligible for from Enron. A Dynegy spokesman, John Sousa, said the company was unsure if Lay could receive a retirement package from them. 
Enron had a conference call scheduled for 1430 GMT. 
Dynegy's purchase of Enron, worth at least dlrs 9.8 billion in stock, would trigger a clause in Lay's contract that gives him a lump sum of dlrs 20.2 million for each full calendar year remaining in his contract if there is a change in control of Enron, according to documents filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Lay's contract with Houston-based Enron runs through 2005. 
Dynegy executives have said they hope to complete their acquisition of Enron by next summer. The Houston-based energy marketer will assume dlrs 13 billion of Enron debt. The Enron name will vanish when the deal is completed. 
Investors continued to bid up both companies' shares Tuesday, in the second day of trading following announcement of the deal. Dynegy shares rose dlrs 2.63, or 6 percent, to close at dlrs 44.94 on the New York Stock Exchange, where Enron shares rose 74 cents, or 8 percent, to close at dlrs 9.98. 
Enron shares have gained 17 percent since Thursday, the day before the merger was announced, but the shares are still a fraction of their 52-week high of dlrs 84.87. 
Dynegy entered talks to buy Enron last month as the trading giant's stock price plunged about 80 percent in the weeks following Enron's posting of a dlrs 618 million third quarter loss. The company also disclosed a dlrs 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to partnerships run by company officers, which allowed Enron to keep about half a billion dollars in debt off its books. 
Those partnerships are now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Enron ousted chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who ran some of the partnerships, and restated its earnings back to 1997. But those actions failed to restore investor confidence. 
Chuck Watson, Dynegy chairman and chief executive, will retain those roles for the combined company while Lay steps down when the deal is done. 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Tuesday the compensation provision given a merger or other change of control has been in Lay's contract since 1989. Such protections are common for chief executive officers, she said. 
In February, Jeff Skilling replaced Lay as president and CEO of Enron and Lay retained his title as chairman. Lay stepped back into the other roles when Skilling unexpectedly resigned in August, citing personal reasons.

Enron's CEO to turn down $60.6 million severance pay 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Ken Lay, Enron Corp.'s chairman and chief executive, won't take the $60.6 million in severance he would be due after Dynegy closes its deal to buy his troubled company. 
Lay made his decision Tuesday after employees' sentiments about the money were relayed to him, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 
At a floor meeting Tuesday for energy traders and marketers and back-office employees to discuss the merger, Lay's severance ""was a very active topic apparently,"" Palmer said, adding that ""quite a bit of concern"" was expressed. 
Documents on a variety of Enron matters, including Lay's severance, were filed with federal securities regulators Tuesday morning. 
Under his employment contract, if Lay ends his employment within 60 days of a so-called ""change of control,"" he gets a lump-sum payment equal to the number of full calendar years left in his employment contract times $20.2 million. 
The merger was announced Friday, but isn't expected to close for six to nine months. Lay's contract runs through Dec. 31, 2005. 
Palmer said a change-of-control clause had been in Lay's contract since 1989. 
Lay won't have a management role with the combined company to be called Dynegy. He's been offered a seat on the new board, but hasn't decided whether to take it. 
Lay's contract was set to expire on Dec. 31, 2003, but was extended in August after CEO Jeff Skilling unexpectedly resigned and Lay jumped back into his former job as chief executive. 
Declining the money, Palmer said, was the best way for Lay to assure employees that he wouldn't profit from the severance provision. 
Last year, Lay made $18.3 million from various forms of compensation, including a $7 million bonus, according to Enron's March proxy statement. 
He was also awarded options to buy 782,830 shares of Enron stock at specified prices over a number of years. The options, though, are worthless at current Enron stock prices. 
This year through Aug. 21, Lay made $25.5 million by exercising options and selling those shares, Graef Crystal, a compensation expert who writes a column for Bloomberg News, said. 
Lay made an average of $31.5 million a year from 1993 to 2000 in various forms of compensation, including exercising options and selling the shares, Crystal said. 
Dynegy on Friday announced a deal to buy its rival for almost $9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $13 billion in debt and $2 billion in preferred stock. 
The price came at bargain-basement rates for a company whose shares as recently as late January closed at $82. Tuesday, shares in Enron closed at $9.98. 
Among Enron's woes: a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, questions on Wall Street about its financial reporting practices and shareholder lawsuits. 
Investors reacted negatively to word that Lay could get $60.6 million. 
""This is ridiculous after what has happened,"" said Donald Coxe, who manages the Harris Insight Equity Fund, which at the end of last month owned about 78,000 shares of Enron. ""The idea that there would be a golden parachute for somebody who as a parachute captain sent his stockholders out of the plane without a parachute strikes me as pretty odd."" 
Even before Tuesday, Lay had other ideas for the severance. 
Early last week, Palmer said Lay proposed to Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chairman and chief executive, that he get two-thirds of what he was due in a noncash payment, such as stock in the merged company. 
With half of the noncash payment, Lay wanted to set up a foundation to provide assistance to Enron employees in need. 
A significant portion of the rest, according to his plan, would have been cash to cover taxes. 
Dynegy declined immediate comment about Lay's Tuesday decision. 
But Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, quipped: ""That might stave off one shareholder lawsuit.""

Enron offers reasons for selling to Dynegy 
Underperforming assets, heavy debt cited 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Among Enron Corp.'s reasons for agreeing to be bought out by rival Dynegy: Underperforming assets were draining cash and earnings, and debt load was stretching the company. 
That Enron faced a loss of confidence from financial markets and departures of some senior executives also played into the decision, documents filed by Enron on Tuesday with federal securities regulators said. 
Before agreeing to a merger with Dynegy, Enron also considered staying independent, an infusion of private equity and an infusion from a strategic partner. 
Friday, the two companies announced Dynegy would buy Enron for almost $9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $13 billion in debt and $2 billion in preferred stock. 
Under the deal, Enron shareholders get 0.2685 share of Dynegy per Enron share. The ratio is subject to ""downward revision"" under certain circumstances, the documents said. 
Also, ChevronTexaco, a Dynegy shareholder, gave Dynegy $1.5 billion. Dynegy on Tuesday injected that money into Enron, aiming to shore up its core energy trading operation. 
In return for the money, Dynegy gets preferred stock and other rights in Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline system. If the deal doesn't close, Dynegy could buy all of Northern Natural Gas, which includes about 17,000 miles of natural gas pipeline. 
The filings say Dynegy's right to buy Northern Natural Gas is first subject to a right of Enron to repurchase Northern Natural Gas. If the merger should not close, Dynegy, under certain circumstances, has the option instead to convert its stake in Northern Natural Gas to Enron stock. 
Also of note in the documents: 
? Enron will finish its second downtown office tower, now under construction, and will keep moving employees into the new building ""at this time."" 
? The merged company will assume the ""rights and obligations"" under Enron's naming-rights deal for Enron Field. 
Enron also made filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning agreements announced Nov. 1 to get $1 billion in credit lines from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup. 
The filing detailed a provision in those agreements that, based on Enron's current credit rating, would have prevented it from tapping those lines. An Enron spokesman said Tuesday the banks have waived that provision. 
Also Tuesday, Enron said it named company executive Raymond Bowen Jr. as treasurer to replace Ben Glisan, who was fired last week. 
Dynegy stock continued its upward movement Tuesday, closing $2.63 higher at $46.94.

Enron chief may hit jackpot CEO's contract calls for a giant payout if control changes

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth Lay stands to receive up to $60.6-million (U.S.) once the top buyer and seller of natural gas in the United States is merged into its smaller, but stronger rival Dynegy Inc. 
Dynegy's purchase of Enron, worth at least $9.8-billion in stock, would trigger a clause in Mr. Lay's contract that gives him a lump sum of $20.2-million for each full calendar year remaining in his contract if there is a change in control of Enron, according to documents filed yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Lay's contract with Houston-based Enron runs through 2005. 
Dynegy executives have said they hope to complete their acquisition of Enron by next summer. The Houston-based energy marketer will assume $13-billion of Enron debt. The Enron name will vanish when the deal is completed. 
""That's a ridiculous amount of money for a man who's already made himself probably tens of millions of dollars,"" said Andrew Whalley, manager of the Legg Mason International Utilities Trust, which sold a $5-million stake in Enron in April because of concern about its bookkeeping. 
""It's a classic golden parachute,"" said Raymond James analyst Jon Kyle Cartwright, noting that it is comparable to financial safety nets in other top corporate contracts. 
But shareholders might not appreciate the parachute given the once-mighty company's recent troubles, Mr. Cartwright said. 
""That's a tough call,"" he said. ""It certainly would have been fair if you had been looking at Enron up to a couple of months ago. Following that it gets dicey, and I'm not sure how shareholders are going to take it."" 
Investors continued to bid up both companies' shares yesterday in the second day of trading following announcement of the deal. Dynegy shares rose $2.63, or 6 per cent, to close at $44.94 on the New York Stock Exchange, where Enron shares rose 74 cents, or 8 per cent, to close at $9.98. 
Enron shares have gained 17 per cent since Thursday, the day before the merger was announced, but the shares are still a fraction of their 52-week high of $84.87. 
Dynegy entered talks to buy Enron last month as the trading giant's stock price plunged about 80 per cent in the weeks following Enron's posting of a $618-million third-quarter loss. The company also disclosed a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity related to partnerships run by company officers, which allowed Enron to keep about half a billion dollars in debt off its books. 
Those partnerships are now under investigation by the SEC. 
Enron ousted chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who ran some of the partnerships, and restated its earnings back to 1997. But those actions failed to restore investor confidence. 
Chuck Watson, Dynegy chairman and CEO, will retain those roles for the combined company while Mr. Lay steps down. 
Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declined comment yesterday on Mr. Lay's agreement with Enron, noting that the companies will operate independently until the merger is finished. 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said yesterday the compensation provision given a merger or other change of control has been in Mr. Lay's contract since 1989. 
In February, Jeff Skilling replaced Mr. Lay as president and CEO of Enron and Mr. Lay retained his title as chairman. Mr. Lay stepped back into the other roles when Mr. Skilling unexpectedly resigned in August, citing personal reasons.

City - Enron chief in line for $60m payout.

Associate City Editor 
KENNETH Lay, chairman and chief executive of Enron, is in line for compensation of more than $60m ( #42m) if he leaves the US company following its $8 billion rescue by its smaller rival Dynegy.
According to documents filed with America's Securities & Exchange Commission, Mr Lay is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to $20.2m for every year remaining on his contract. His contract expires at the end of 2005, while Dynegy's takeover of Enron, announced on Friday, is due to be completed in the third quarter of next year. 
The contract was extended by two years in August, when he resumed chief executive duties following the departure of Jeffrey Skilling. It provides that, in addition to his compensation, he will receive an extra amount to cover tax penalties if the sum he gets is considered to be an ""excess parachute payment"". 
Enron, once valued at $80 billion, has seen its shares lose 80pc in the past three weeks after announcing a $586m loss, an equity write-down and a regulatory inquiry into off balance sheet dealings.

MARK TO MARKET: Retail Sales To Surge On Free Money
By Jim Murphy

11/14/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Professionals and amateurs alike agree that at 8:30 a.m. EST the Commerce Department will report that U.S. retail sales rose in October.
Some observers believe that retail sales not only rose last month, but that they surged - 5.5% being the top of the forecast range. 
All again agree that the main stimulant was the zero-percent financing offered by the major automakers. 
In September, sadness and other negative emotions engendered by the events of 9/11 helped to fashion a 2.4% drop in overall retail sales and a 1.6% decline when auto sales were excluded. 
The Dow Jones Newswires median forecast of 21 economists has it that overall retail sales rose 2.5% in October, while they were ahead only 0.4% when auto sales were excluded. 
While it is difficult to believe that any market will move lower in response to a notable improvement in retail sales, the most compelling ways in which the report can be ""spun"" are all negative. 
A few examples. The October increase will be from a depressed September level. 
Yes, October retail sales were goosed by zero-percent financing, but November won't get such a lift even though the zero-percent sales campaign isn't over yet. 
That's because even if ""free"" money lured me out of my shell and into the showroom in October, it will have no effect on me in November or in December. I already bought a new car. Unless I'm a rich collector, that's it for at least year or two. 
The more metaphysical of commentators will also note that many October car sales spurred by zero-percent financing were ""in a very real sense"" stolen from subsequent months. Without ""free"" money, I might, for example, have waited until April of 2002 before buying a new car. 
Then, too, there is the cost to the automakers of the zero-interest loans. GM's General Motors Acceptance Corp., which finances the parent's cars, will remain a profit center, but it won't be from auto loans made in October. 
I'll leave the summing to a professional (because I agree with him). 
""Retail sales probably reversed the plunge in September, although mainly because of a spike in autos that is unlikely to be sustained for more than one month,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, economist at UBS Warburg. 

Vienna Meeting Overshadowed 

Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Ministers began meeting today in Vienna. 
Most oil traders are looking for them to cut daily output by around 1.5 million barrels. But who ever really knows with OPEC, which I have cleverly punned, more than once, into opaque. 
Besides there's a war going on in Afghanistan and oil-rich Iraq may be next - and who knows but that the House of Saud won't be toppled by Islamic fundamentalists. To name but a few topics that are more compelling than a periodic quota buck-and-wing by OPEC. 

Would You Believe The Enron Award? 

I told you in Tuesday's mornings M2M that I failed after searching for an hour to find out what Fed Chairman Greenspan was doing at Rice University Tuesday evening. 
Wouldn't you just know it? I found out this morning what Mr. Greenspan was doing in a dispatch from the Associated Press. He went to Rice to receive the Enron Prize for Distinguished Public Service from the University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. Enron will be taken over by Dynegy Inc. So this will probably be the final Enron award, and no I'm not going to avail myself of a handy invitation to irony. 
Mr. Greenspan had some things of interest to say to the folks at Rice, but none that we haven't heard from him before. Such as, "" ... there is no evidence that we have, in this process of events since March of the year 2000, significantly altered the long-term underlying structure of productivity growth."" 
With all due respect, Al, productivity growth is not likely to be exponential as in a nuclear reaction, but appears tied to earth by the Law of Diminishing Returns. 
The big guy is on the stump again today. 
Mr. Greenspan gives the keynote address at an ""economic forum"" in Washington D.C. sponsored by the board of directors of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
Dow Jones Newswires says the speech begins at 3:00 p.m. EST. That's our story and we're sticking to it. 
Another major wire service says, depending on which calendar or story you look at, that the speech begins at both 3:00 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. In this business, mistakes are made. 
Anyhow, no big deal. If you might need to hear what the big guy might say just begin paying attention at 3:00 p.m.

Just stick it out or be a sucker
Abracadabra / Shubhrangshu Roy

11/14/2001
The Economic Times
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

YOU move a step forward and you are a sucker, you move a step backward and you are a sucker still. That just about sums up Indias predicament in trying to get one-time US energy trading giant Enron off its back and off the 2,100 MW Dabhol power plant for some time now. 
For the past fortnight or so, the institutions have been bargaining hard to find a buyer for Enrons assets in Maharashtra, having committed over Rs 6,200 crore in loans. Last weekend, they even went into a huddle in Singapore to sew up the loose ends of a bail-out.
Little seems to have been thrashed out so far. Little possibly will. Unless, of course, the FIs tighten the screws with a take-it or leave-it offer. The time to make that choice is now. 
A gentleman in pin-stripes whos done a lot of running around these past few weeks to help sew up the deal, told me the other day that Enron had indeed agreed to part with its stake in DPC at a 30 per cent discount. 
That would have fetched it just about $800-odd million spread over a five-year period. So, why hasnt a deal been struck? 
Its probably not worked out because of what Enron considers a fair discount on what it has sunk into the project. Prospective buyers consider this too high an asking price. 
For the record, Enron claims to have sunk in $1.2 billion in the project together with its partners GE and Bechtel who have supplied equipment and helped construct the plant. 
But my gentleman friend in pin-stripes suggests that $1.2 billion isnt exactly their equity contribution in Dabhol. That amount works out to just about $800 million. 
Enron, actually splurged close to $200 million on development expenses, which in gentlemens lingo is another way of saying that the energy giant could have ended up bribing its way to see the once coveted project through besides fighting sundry court cases in India. 
And it wants part of that money back. Now which prospective buyer will compensate Enron for possible bribes or for making court appearances? 
Enron, it appears, has also claimed another $140 million as its share of Dabhols retained earnings, which should eventually go to all stake-holders in DPC (the MSEB included) once the companys board passes a resolution that the amount is shared proportionately among all those who have invested in Dabhols equity capital. Till then, leave the retained earnings aside. 
So, what Enron should work on is a fair discount on its equity contribution in the project, which is no more than $800 million. Now given its willingness to take a 30 per cent knock, Enron should not expect more than $560 million as the asking price for walking out of Dabhol. 
Add to that, if you will, another $140 million by way of retained earnings and Enron should not be getting more than $700 million at the most. Is Enron willing to take this knock? 
Given a choice, it could resist this offer. But Enron has no choice. And thats reason for cheer. Last week, Enron, close to the present American dispensation (chairman Ken Lay was the biggest fund-raiser for President George Bushs campaign effort last year) opted for a $7.8 billion rescue offer from smaller Houston rival Dynegy after narrowly escaping credit ratings cut to junk status. 
For the past several months Enron had been using its clout with Mr Bush to push through a bail-out package on Dabhol that suited its terms. That privilege now seems to be gone as the company grapples to stave off a Securities Exchange Commission inquiry into off-balancesheet transactions. 
And until Enron clears several questions back home about its finances, it will remain suspect in the eyes of US investors. 
In India, where Enrons made more news for its misses than its hits, the timing couldnt have been more opportune than now for prospective private bidders to strike a potentially lucrative deal. 
Two such bidders, Tata Power and BSES, are said to have offered no more than $400 million to buy out Enrons stake in DPC. Its time they stuck to that price. Or else, we could still end up being suckers. What?

Deal made; now Dynegy must make it work
David Greising

11/14/2001
Chicago Tribune
North Sports Final ; N
1
(Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)

When three top Enron Corp. executives proposed a merger to one of his lieutenants two weeks ago, no one needed to tell Chuck Watson that Enron was desperate. 
The founder and chairman of Dynegy Inc. is a wily old energy trader. He can smell desperate two oil fields away. Or three city blocks away, as was the case between these Houston rivals.
A liquidity crisis threatened to reduce Enron's credit rating to junk status. Wall Street analysts were hostile after disclosures about conflicts of interest and huge losses on outside trading partnerships. Investors had fled. 
When the approach came, Watson didn't jump. He sat. He sent word to have Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay call him if the offer was serious. 
A nice negotiating move, for sure. Watson put the seller at a minor tactical disadvantage. But Watson adds a kindlier spin: He didn't want to appear to be pouncing on Enron's troubles. 
Two weeks of negotiations and demi-due-diligence later, Watson and Lay had their deal. Dynegy would buy Enron, a company three times its size, in a $24 billion deal. 
Watson takes satisfaction that Dynegy, the company that was always smaller and stodgier than Enron, became the buyer. Most of his career, Watson has operated in Enron's shadow. 
The two companies were formed the same year, 1985. After 15 years at Conoco, Watson persuaded Morgan Stanley to give him a line of credit to form a small energy trading company. Lay, meanwhile, engineered the merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth of Omaha. 
""Ken put two pipelines together to make that company. I had six people and a smile,"" Watson told me during the Chicago stop of an East Coast-to-Texas barnstorming to sell the deal to investors. 
Enron was always the bigger glamor play. Lay's move from a base of trading natural gas and electric power into the engineering of exotic financial deals in areas as diverse as communications bandwidth, paper, steel and media won a huge Wall Street following and doubled Enron's stock price last year, to above $80 a share. 
Dynegy by contrast seemed downright dull. Though it dabbled in broadband communications, Dynegy stuck mainly to the business of generating, trading and delivering gas and electricity. Though Dynegy's stock price nearly quadrupled last year to $59, Dynegy never turned heads the way Enron did. 
Today, Enron has no friends left. The messy breakdown of Enron's trades with outside partnerships has forced it into Dynegy's embrace. Watson thinks Wall Street went hard on Enron because of the company's high-handed manner when it was on top. ""If you have that personality and things go wrong, I mean, everybody's going to take your legs off,"" Watson says. 
This would be a tidy tortoise-and-hare tale except for one thing: Enron's problems are such a mess, they could make for rough going at Dynegy, too. 
Watson thinks he has protected himself. He can walk from the deal if Enron's legal entanglements exceed $3.5 billion. If, on the other hand, Enron's problems don't get worse and other bidders emerge, he gets a healthy $350 million break-up fee and ownership of a key Enron pipeline. 
That's better than nothing. But it's hardly a failsafe. Some Enron trades with the outside partnerships don't unwind for years, so problems might not emerge until after Dynegy has closed its deal. 
There are more mainstream challenges, too. 
Roughly half of Enron's operating profits last year came from off- balance sheet transactions Watson wants to eliminate. Replacing that won't be easy. And Watson needs to handle at least $14 billion in Enron debt. 
Enron's high rollers might not fit into Dynegy's careful culture. Watson's team also must stretch to run a company that, even with divestitures, will jump to at least three times Dynegy's current size. 
Watson's personality can be aw-shucks disarming. Born at Great Lakes Naval Air Station in Illinois, the son of a Navy officer, he lived in 22 places before he graduated high school. Now, if he closes the deal, he'll be running one of the country's largest companies. 
No one would get a kick from taking Watson down a notch. But that hardly means investors won't knock him if he can't make the Enron deal work.

Dynegy defends merger partner ; CEO says Enron errors not illegal
Melita Marie Garza, Tribune staff reporter

Chicago Tribune
North Sports Final ; N

(Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)

The downfall of energy-trading titan Enron Corp. was the result of ""bad business practices"" rather than illegal activity, says Chuck Watson, chief executive of Dynegy Inc., the company acquiring Enron in a deal valued at $24 billion. 
""I'm not persuaded that you'll find anything illegal,"" Watson said Tuesday, commenting on the Securities and Exchange Commission's probe into Enron's off-balance sheet transactions in energy partnerships.
Watson's comments came as Enron, in a filing with the SEC, disclosed that Kenneth Lay, the company's chairman and chief executive, could walk away with a golden parachute worth more than $80 million if the merger succeeds. Under terms of a pre-existing employment contract, Lay would receive $20.2 million a year for each full year outstanding on his contract if control of Enron changes hands during his employment. 
At the same time, Enron issued a letter to employees warning that the deal with Dynegy was likely to result in workforce reductions at Enron. ""As with any merger,"" the letter said, ""some elimination of positions is almost inevitable."" 
Enron, the nation's largest trader of natural gas and electricity, has seen its stock price collapse in recent weeks largely because of soured transactions with energy partnerships run by one of its former executives and additional revelations about questionable accounting practices at Enron. 
Power-trading rival Dynegy, owner of downstate utility Illinois Power, moved last week to acquire its hobbled competitor, agreeing to pay the equivalent of about $10 a share for a company that as recently as last January traded above $80 a share. 
In a wide-ranging interview, Watson criticized the practice at Dynegy of permitting Enron executives to sit on the partnership boards and profit from them. ""You don't let that happen,"" Watson said. ""It would never have gotten by me."" 
Watson sees the distinction between illegal conduct and bad judgment at Enron as significant because the absence of illegality would minimize grounds for shareholder lawsuits. 
Dynegy has said the merger is contingent on litigation costs over Enron's problems staying under $3.5 billion. ""I don't think it's going to be anywhere near that level,"" Watson said. 
Enron's misfortunes, Watson said, paved the way for Dynegy's opportunity. ""This is all about brand,"" he said. ""They lost credibility and investor confidence."" 
Dynegy's takeover of its higher-profile rival is a coup for Dynegy, which has been viewed by some as an ""Enron wannabe."" But Watson brushed off the description. ""That's actually not true,"" Watson said. ""It's clearly not true now."" 
Watson asserted that nothing had gone wrong with Enron's core businesses. That fact, he said, had been lost--by investors and potential Enron suitors--in the controversy surrounding the off- balance sheet transactions. 
""Maybe the tires fell off the car and the paint was chipped, but the engine was still strong,"" Watson said, referring to Enron's core businesses. 
In an apparent conundrum, Dynegy's bid for Enron at what is viewed as a bargain basement price has not brought any other companies to the bargaining table. Enron's problems reportedly scared off some prospective bidders, such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. 
Watson argued that Dynegy was uniquely positioned to pursue the Enron deal, in large part because the rivals had extensive business dealings together. 
""It took our guys days--not months--to do due diligence,"" Watson said. ""We were right there in town. It was the time factor, the knowledge that we had of the industry and the business."" 
For example, Watson said Shell Oil Co., another company thought to have an interest in acquiring Enron, would not have had the background to move as quickly as Dynegy had in putting together the merger. 
While saying that he had respect for the regulatory approval process, Watson reiterated his belief that the merger posed no antitrust concerns. ""We don't have a pipeline business, they do,"" Watson said. ""They don't have a generation business, we do.""

USA: UPDATE 1-Calpers calls on Enron board to step aside in merger.

11/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

PASADENA, Calif., Nov 13 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. pension fund said on Tuesday the board of energy trader Enron Corp should step aside if the company moves forward with its plans to be bought by Dynegy Inc 
The California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers) said it would oppose any efforts by Enron to place its current board members on the new board of a company resulting from the proposed $9 billion stock-swap merger announced on Friday.
Calpers owns about 3 million Enron shares, or about 0.4 percent of all shares outstanding. However, the public pension fund is widely watched for its stances on corporate governance. 
The merger would value Houston-based Enron at a fraction of what it was worth a year ago. The shares have lost 89 percent of their value over the past 52 weeks. 
A spokesman from Calpers and a spokeswoman from Enron could not be reached for comment. 
In declaring its position on the merger, Calpers cited reports that Enron was seeking the right to appoint three of its current board members to the combined company's board. 
Enron in recent weeks has reshuffled its management in response to a U.S. regulatory probe into murky financial transactions. The company has said that former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who abruptly left the company last month, had made $30 million managing limited partnerships that conducted outside transactions with Enron. 
""There have been serious allegations of self-dealing on the part of Enron's senior management,"" Michael Flaherman, chair of Calpers Investment Committee, said after a meeting of the pension's administrative board. ""And it appears that Enron's board may have failed in its responsibility to monitor the activities of Enron's corporate officers."" 
""Until all of these issues are sorted out,"" he continued, ""the interests of shareholders are best served by retiring all of the current directors from involvement in Enron's successor entities."" 
California state officials and Enron clashed last year over the state's power crisis, which triggered the bankruptcy of California's largest utility Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp 
California Gov. Gray Davis and others blasted Enron and other state power companies, accusing them of manipulating the market and jacking up prices. 
Enron is by far the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the United States, with analysts estimating it is involved in some 25 percent of the daily trades in those markets. 
Calpers said it also has a stake in Houston-based Dynegy but it did not provide details on that investment.

HOUSTON (AP) - Maybe they'll call it the Dynegy Prize next time. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was in Houston on Tuesday night to pick up the Enron Prize for Distinguished Public Service, an award named for the teetering energy company that is being bought by rival Dynegy Inc. for about $9 billion.
At one point Greenspan expounded on the values of ethicism to the Rice University crowd while Ken Lay, whose company has been blasted on Wall Street for concealing transactions with entities run by the company's chief financial officer, looked on. 
""My experience is that it really works to be as ethical as possible as one knows and to define one's values in a very succinct and important way,"" Greenspan said when asked by a pending college graduate about venturing into the work world. 
Lay, in his first major public appearance since the merger announcement, was met with warm applause and made some brief congratulatory remarks. 
No mention was made of Enron's current woes or Lay's decision earlier in the day to waive about $60 million he would be due as the merger closes. 
Past winners of the Enron Prize, awarded by the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice, include Colin Powell, Nelson Mandela and Mikhail Gorbachev.

CalPERS Opposes Enron Board Members' Appt To Dynegy Board

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The board of the California Public Employees' Retirement System Tuesday said it will oppose the appointment of any current Enron Corp (ENE) board member to a board created by the planned merger of Enron and Dynegy, Inc (DYN), a CalPERS spokesman said. 
""There have been serious allegations of self-dealing on the part of Enron's senior management,"" said Michael Flaherman, Chair of CalPERS Investment Committee, in a release. ""And it appears Enron's board may have failed in its responsibility to monitor the activities of Enron's corporate officers. Until all of these issues are sorted out, the interests of shareholders are best served by retiring all of the current directors from involvement in Enron's successor entities.""
Calpers holds 3 million shares in Enron and a $500 million stake in an Enron partnership called Joint Energy Development Investments II. 
Dynegy announced Friday its plans to buy Enron for $8.85 billion. As part of the deal, Enron would be able to appoint at least three members to the board of the combined company. Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay was offered a seat on the new board, but has not yet said if he will accept. 
Concerns about Enron's dealings with off-balance sheet partnerships like JEDI II drove the company's stock price down 80% in the three weeks before the merger was announced. Its credit ratings were also downgraded to one level above junk. 
On Oct. 30, California state Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, wrote CalPERS Chief Executive James Burton urging the pension fund to take steps to defend its investment in Enron. 
""CalPERS may play a significantly larger and more active role in the governance of Enron to ensure that Enron directors do not have conflicting interests, that Enron adheres to a policy of full financial disclosure and transparency and that Enron's board is comprised of a substantial majority of truly independent directors who understand their accountability to shareholders,"" Peace wrote. 
CalPERs, the nation's largest public pension fund with assets totaling $151 billion, has a strong history of shareholder activism. It was not immediately known if the board would take any additional action regarding Enron, a spokesman said.

Jesse Jackson Asks Energy Companies to Hire More Minorities

11/13/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Associated Press 
HOUSTON -- The energy industry has an untapped resource in minorities who traditionally have been overlooked by big business, including the energy sector, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said Tuesday.
Mr. Jackson has been in Houston -- dubbed the nation's energy capital -- for two days, bringing together more than 700 representatives of minority-owned businesses with those running some of the nation's largest energy companies at his inaugural Wall Street Project Energy Summit. 
""We do not have a talent shortage,"" Mr. Jackson told the minority business owners who sat in on a discussion with representatives from Enron Corp. (ENE), Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Shell Oil Co. (RD). ""We have an opportunity shortage."" 
Mr. Jackson, speaking at a hotel just down the street from the headquarters of troubled Enron, said now was the time for minorities to make their presence known with the proposed Dynegy purchase of Enron, its larger rival. He said spinoff companies and other opportunities created by the proposed merger, as well as deregulation of the Texas energy market, offer possibilities for those who possess knowledge of the changing industry. 
""The question is not 'Can we produce?' The question is 'Can they see our capacity to produce,'"" Mr. Jackson said. ""We are a knowledgeable people. We have a low profile, but we have a place in the industry."" 
Energy company representatives agreed. The question for them, however, was how to change what has become business as usual, they said. 
""Most CEOs who do business in corporate America are comfortable with who they do business with,"" said Milton Scott, Dynegy's chief administrative officer and senior vice president. ""Many of them are not inherently racist."" 
""I would call it racism 10 years ago,"" Mr. Jackson replied. ""Today I would call it cultural blindness and part of our job is to take the patch off their eye."" 
Gaurdie Bannister, Shell Oil's vice president of business development, said there are a number of individuals in large companies who are willing to ""break eggs"" with minority-owned businesses but often run into roadblocks because those companies are unable to cushion a large risk that would be taken, for example, in an offshore project. 
""If you are not big and you don't have the capital to take that risk with me, I can't use you,"" he said. 
Mr. Scott said a way for smaller minority-owned businesses to get around such obstacles and get the big contracts is to combine their strengths. 
""Join forces,"" he said. ""Set your egos aside and you are going to have a lot more success because then you take away some of the risk."" 
Reducing risk isn't the goal, Mr. Jackson said. Instead, it's a level playing field for everyone.

Enron Names Raymond Bowen Treasurer

11/13/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) named Raymond M. Bowen, Jr., treasurer and executive vice president-finance, replacing Ben Glisan, who was fired last week. 
In a press release Wednesday, the energy company said Bowen had been serving as chief operating officer of Enron Industrial Markets.
Last week, Enron, in the midst of heavy scrutiny over its finances and talks regarding a possible acquisition of Dynegy Inc. (DYN), announced plans to restate its financial statements for the past few years to account for losses related to a number of limited partnerships, including several under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The company also said it had fired two executives - Glisan, managing director and treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, managing director and general counsel - for their supposed involvement with the limited partnerships formed by Enron's then chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
Fastow earned as much as $30 million through his role with the partnerships, while a number of other Enron employees also invested in them personally. 
The other employees involved, including executives Michael Kopper, Kathy Lynn and Anne Yeager, no longer worked for Enron.

USA: Enron names Raymond Bowen treasurer.

11/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , which in recent weeks has reshuffled its management in response to a U.S. regulatory probe into murky transactions, said on Tuesday it named Raymond Bowen treasurer and vice-president of finance. 
The troubled energy trader said Bowen previously served as both chief operating officer of Enron Industrial Markets and treasurer of Enron Capital & Trade Resources.
Houston-based Enron has shed almost $20 billion in market value in the past month and has sufferend a series of credit rating downgrades as a result of the probe. On Friday, smaller rival Dynegy Inc. said it would buy out the beleaguered company for about $9 billion. 
Enron shares rose 75 cents to close at $9.99 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

USA: Enron earnings restatement a sign of deceit-suits.
By David Howard Sinkman

11/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Lawyers filing lawsuits against Enron Corp. on Tuesday said the restatement last week of more than four years of earnings is a clear sign the energy trader and its chief executives misled investors. 
At least 10 law firms are seeking class action status on behalf of plaintiffs they said were deceived by false and misleading statements or because adverse information was concealed, causing Enron's shares to be artificially inflated.
""Enron restating its earnings is certainly going to help our case. It demonstrates that in their opinion their earnings were false when initially published,"" said lawyer Arthur Stock of Berger & Montague PC in Philadelphia, one of the law firms seeking class-action status. 
Enron declined to comment. 
The lawsuits name the company, Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, former CEO Jeffrey Skilling and Andrew Fastow, a former chief financial officer, as defendants. 
In another blow to its damaged reputation among investors, the Houston-based company last week admitted it erred in reporting past results. It reduced its earnings from 1997 to 2000 by $591 million, or 22 percent of the amount that had previously been released on its financial statements. Earnings for the first two quarters of 2001 also were restated. 
Enron has garnered investor ire since it unexpectedly reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion in mid-October, saying off-balance sheet transactions had contributed to that and to $1 billion in charges. 
The company's stock plunged as almost daily developments sullied investors. It lost almost 80 percent of value from the day the company reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16, to the announcement last week that rival Dynegy Inc. would buy Enron for about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of about $13 billion in debt. 
Enron shares closed Tuesday 75 cents higher at $9.99 on the New York Stock Exchange, far off its August 2000 high of $90.56. 
INCREASED TIME FRAME 
In the latest lawsuit to be filed against Enron since it was rocked by a U.S. regulatory probe in October, the law firm of Cauley Geller Bowman & Coates said misrepresentations and omissions by the defendants violated their duty to release accurate and truthful information on the company's finances. 
""Each of the defendants is liable as a participant in a fraudulent scheme and course of business that operated as a fraud or deceit on purchasers of Enron common stock by disseminating materially false and misleading statements,"" said Cauley Geller in a lawsuit filed in Texarkana, Texas. 
The suit was filed Nov. 9, the day after the restated earnings were released, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. 
Prior to the restatement of results, prompted by concerns raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the lawsuits filed against Enron were on the behalf of shareholders who bought common stock between Jan. 18, 2000 and Oct. 17. 
However, since Enron restated its results, Cauley Geller increased the time frame, or ""class period"" on behalf of investors who bought Enron stock, from Jan. 18, 1999 to Nov. 8. 
""The effect of the restatement was dramatic,"" said Cauley Geller. ""Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors."" 
Cauley Geller said selling of Enron stock by key executives was ""unusual and suspicious given its timing."" Lay sold $11.2 million worth of shares during the period, and Skilling sold $6.41 million in stock, the law firm said. 
""People who have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars are naturally angry, Stock said. ""It is expected in this type of situation."" 
In a filing with the SEC on Tuesday, it was reported Lay could walk away with more than $80 million if the acquisiton by Dnyegy closes this year.

USA: S&P says Dynegy deal saves Enron from junk rating.
By Nancy Leinfuss

11/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , teetering on the brink of junk status, got a reprieve late Friday when Standard & Poor's cut the troubled energy trading company's credit ratings but stopped a notch short of the speculative-grade category, after news of its potential acquisition by Dynegy Inc. 
""The way to look at the Dynegy transaction is it really in a sense maintains the investment-grade quality to Enron's credit rating,"" said Todd Shipman, analyst at S&P. ""It's safe to say that absent a Dynegy deal, Enron was quite likely to end up non-investment-grade quality because of what had happened,"" Shipman said.
Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, has been struggling to overcome a plummeting stock price and falling credit ratings in the past month following disclosures of off-balance sheet deals now under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for possible conflict of interest. 
S&P lowered its long-term corporate credit rating on Enron to BBB-minus from BBB, its lowest investment-grade rating. A cut below that, to junk, would make it tougher for Enron to issue debt and run its day-to-day business. 
The rating agency also placed the ratings of Dynegy on creditwatch negative after the energy provider said it had agreed to acquire Enron for about $9.5 billion. 
Terms of the Dynegy transaction call for Dynegy to swap 0.2685 shares of its own stock for each Enron share, the companies said. That would value Houston-based Enron at $10.41 per share, including convertible stock, a premium of about 21 percent over Friday's closing price of $8.63. 
The takeover announcement halted a free-fall in Enron's stock, which has lost about 75 percent of its market capitalization in the past month. On Tuesday,, Enron shares closed at $9.99, up $0.75 cents, or 8.12 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Enron's debt, which has been trading at levels associated with higher-risk junk bonds, moved higher on the news. The company's 7.875 percent notes due 2003 were traded at 92 cents on the dollar, up from the mid-80's range last week, traders said. 
Industry experts said the most critical component of the deal was an immediate cash infusion by Dynegy shareholder ChevronTexaco into Enron. 
ChevronTexaco, which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, has agreed to infuse $1.5 billion immediately into Enron to support it until the deal closes. It would inject another $1 billion into the merged company once the deal closes. 
""That was an important part of that whole deal, not just Dynegy coming in and offering money to buy Enron out, but also providing that up-front liquidity to protect the value of Enron's trading business, which is really the crown jewel, so to speak, that Dynegy is interested in,"" said Shipman. 
S&P said Dynegy's corporate credit rating is likely to remain within the BBB category, as a result of its purchase of Enron, ""We saw an investment-grade company, within a range of BBB-plus to BBB."" said Shipman. ""If things go as planned, Dynegy would keep its credit rating."" 
S&P said it will continue to monitor the planned acquisition by Dynegy of Enron and warned that a downgrade to junk status for Enron would be likely if the transaction is not completed. 
""The main thing we'll be monitoring at this point is Enron's liquidity and the value of its trading franchise, because that's really what Dynegy is interested in,"" said Shipman. 
""If there were to be an effect on Enron's trading business that would be significant enough to reduce Dynegy's interest in Enron, that would raise the possibility that the merger would not be completed, then the possibility of downgrade would be very strong for Enron,"" Shipman said. 
Moody's Investors Service, another major U.S. rating agency, could not immediately be reached for comment on any potential rating actions after news of Enron's buyout by Dynegy. Moody's rates Enron debt in line with S&P, at ""Baa3,"" its lowest investment-grade rating. 
Enron, with $100 billion in revenues and $1 billion in profits last year, is fifth on Fortune 500's list of largest U.S. companies. Dynegy, 54th on the Fortune list, had $29 billion in revenues and $500 million in earnings.

Enron's Board Should Step Aside From New Company, Calpers Says
2001-11-14 00:22 (New York)

Enron's Board Should Step Aside From New Company, Calpers Says

     Pasadena, California, Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s
board should not be allowed to stay if Dynegy Inc. completes its
proposed purchase of the energy trader, the California Public
Employees' Retirement System said.

     Calpers, which owns about 3 million Enron shares, said it
intends to oppose any such appointments because the company's
board failed to properly monitor Enron's senior management. Fund
officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment on a press
release distributed by Business Wire.

     Enron partnerships run by the company's former chief
financial officer, Andrew Fastow, are being investigated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The entities bought and sold
Enron shares and assets. Enron ousted Fastow in October.

     ``Until all of these issues are sorted out, the interests of
shareholders are best served by retiring all of the current
directors from involvement in Enron's successor entities,''
Michael Flaherman, chair of Calpers Investment Committee, said in
the statement.

     Calpers is the country's largest public pension fund.

     Enron shares rose 74 cents to $9.98. Dynegy shares rose $2.63
to $46.94. Both companies are based in Houston.

Enron CEO Won't Accept $60.6 Mln in Severance, Spokesman Says
2001-11-13 18:04 (New York)

Enron CEO Won't Accept $60.6 Mln in Severance, Spokesman Says

     Houston, Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay will not accept severance pay
of more than $60 million that he would have received after Dynegy
Inc. took over the company.

     ``He decided the best thing was to waive it altogether after
speaking to employees at a meeting this afternoon,'' Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer said. Lay declined to comment.

     Lay is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to $20.2
million, multiplied by the number of full calendar years remaining
on his contract, if he terminates his employment under certain
circumstances, such as the acquisition by Dynegy, Enron said in a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.

    ``That's a ridiculous amount of money for a man who's already
made himself probably tens of millions of dollars,'' said Andrew
Whalley, manager of the Legg Mason International Utilities Trust,
which sold a $5 million stake in Enron in April because of concern
about its bookkeeping.

     Lay had gains of $123.4 million from the exercise of options
in 2000, in addition to his regular salary.  Robert Doty, Dynegy's
chief financial officer, refused to discuss severance packages for
departing Enron executives at a meeting with investors in Boston
today.

                           Mind Changed

      Dynegy says its buyout of Enron, the biggest energy trader,
is expected to close in 2002's third quarter. Lay's contract runs
through the end of 2005.  If the Enron buyout were to close this
year, or if there were another form of ``change of control'' at
Enron, Lay would be entitled to receive $80.8 million, the Enron
filing indicates. If it closes next year as planned, he'll get at
least $60.6 million.

     Lay's contract provides that he also could receive an amount
to cover tax penalties if the payment he gets is deemed to be an
``excess parachute payment'' under tax rules, the filing said.

Palmer said Lay was unlikely to qualify for the additional money.

     Earlier today, Lay planned to propose to Dynegy that he take
two-thirds of his severance pay in ``non-cash form,'' presumably
Dynegy stock and use half of the stock to set up a fund to provide
``need-based assistance'' to former Enron employees, Palmer said.

     After the employee meeting this afternoon, Lay decided the
employees would prefer to have him waive it altogether. It will be
up to Dynegy to decide if a fund should be set up for former Enron
employees, Palmer said.

                        $23 Billion Buyout

     Enron agreed on Friday to be acquired by rival Dynegy for at
least $23 billion in stock and assumed debt, ending a financial
crisis that threatened to bankrupt Enron and disrupt U.S. power
and natural-gas markets.

     Lay, 59 years old, has said he won't be an active manager in
the new company, which will be led by Dynegy Chairman and CEO
Charles Watson. No decision has been made about whether he might
serve on Dynegy's board, the companies said.

     ``They need Ken Lay to close the deal because of his skill
with regulators,'' said Mark Maloney, who helps manage $1.1
billion in the John Hancock Patriot Funds, who attended a
presentation to investors by the two companies in Boston today.
``Lay is close to the Bush administration, and that couldn't
hurt.''  The Patriot Funds don't own shares of Enron or Dynegy.

      Lay has been chairman since February 1986. His contract was
extended by two years, to the end of 2005, when he resumed the
CEO's job following the departure of Jeffrey Skilling in August.
Skilling didn't get a severance package because he quit, Enron has
said.

     The company more than tripled Lay's pay package last year to
$18.3 million following its best share-price performance in 20
years, according to a proxy filed in March with the SEC. Enron
shares have plunged 90 percent this year. Lay made $5.97 million
in 1999, according to Enron's proxy.

     Lay also received options to buy 782,830 shares over seven
years, most at $47.31 each, the March filing said. Those options
are now worthless because Enron's stock price is below the price
at which they could be exercised.

     Shares of Enron rose 74 cents to $9.98. Dynegy rose $2.63 to
$46.94. Both companies are based in Houston.

SWITZERLAND: Swiss EWZ suspends planned power venture with Enron.

11/14/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

ZURICH, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Swiss utility Elektrizitaetswerk der Stadt Zuerich (EWZ) has suspended its planned power trading joint venture with Enron Corp that was supposed to start up in January, EWZ said on Wednesday. 
Enron, hit by financial problems, is on the verge of being taken over by smaller rival Dynergy Inc , which agreed last week to buy Enron in a stock swap worth about $9 billion.
""Given these circumstances, EWZ...has decided to suspend the prepared start of a joint trading company of EWZ and Enron and to review the strategy of future cooperation with Enron or Dynergy,"" it said in a statement. 
It said the review would determine which aspects of the cooperation accord could still be attractive and if the proposed venture could be revived at some future date.

Headed For A Fall ; Companies issued special zero-coupon bonds, assuming they'd never have to pay them off. Now shareholders could be on the hook for a $65 billion tab.

It was an irresistible proposition: Borrow billions of dollars, pay no interest, reap millions in tax breaks, and then wait for the debt to simply disappear. That was the promise of zero-coupon convertible bonds, and companies from Enron to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money. 
But, of course, there was a catch: For this scenario to play out, a company's stock price had to rise sharply--and quickly. That's because investors bought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity--if the stock tanked, the bonds would no longer be worth converting. So to make them more attractive to buyers, companies had to build in an escape hatch: If the stock price failed to rise sufficiently, investors could ""put"" (that is, sell) the bonds back to the company--in many cases, after just one year.
And that's exactly what's about to happen--to the tune of some $65 billion over the next three years. Stock prices have fallen so far that for at least half of these special hybrids, the prospect of conversion is now absurd. It simply won't happen. So bondholders are looking to get their money back the first chance they can. And because of the put feature, that is possible. Suddenly companies like Tyco, Comcast, and dozens more are on the hook for billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they'd never have to pay. 
That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies. After all, they're the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt comes due. Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay bondholders. Companies without enough cash-- and the majority fall into this camp--are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow money anew. That means sharply reduced earnings. Especially at risk are investors in companies with poor credit ratings--prime candidates for killer refinancing costs. Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay off the debt, creating significant shareholder dilution, especially at current depressed prices. To make matters worse, this is happening at a time when the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrinking. ""This is a ticking time bomb,"" warns Margaret Patel, manager of the Pioneer High Yield Bond fund, a top-performing junk fund. 
The seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000, when the stock market started to falter. Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling stock while their share prices were struggling. Zero-coupon convertible bonds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn't have to make cash interest payments on the bonds (hence the name ""zero""). Instead issuers offered an up-front discount--for instance, investors would buy a bond for $700 and collect $1,000 when it matured. 
Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed number of common shares. But the bonds were structured so that conversion would make sense only if the stock price rose significantly--in many cases, by more than 50%. With that protective feature (called the conversion premium), zeros took off. Corporate issuers would pay no interest, and once their stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels, the debt would be swept away into equity. ""If the bonds are converted, it's a home run for everybody,"" says Jonathan Cohen, vice president of convertible-bond analysis at Deutsche Bank. 
That four-bagger, of course, depends entirely on the stock price rising. If it doesn't, the bondholders, armed with that handy put feature, can simply sell the bonds back to the company. Great for bondholders, but not so hot for the company or its shareholders. But, hey, what are the odds of that happening? ""CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go up,"" says Cohen. ""They don't worry about the bond getting put."" 
If all this seems a little complicated, that's because it is. A real-life example should help. California-based electric utility Calpine issued $1 billion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt. At the time, the company's stock was trading at about $55 a share--severely undervalued in the opinion of company management. ""We really didn't want to sell equity at that point,"" says Bob Kelly, Calpine's senior vice president of finance. So the company instead opted to sell zeros, setting the conversion premium at a hefty 37%. 
Still, with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise significantly to make conversion worthwhile, the bonds weren't exactly a screaming buy for investors. So Calpine added the put feature: Investors could sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase price, eliminating any downside risk. 
Things haven't exactly worked out as management had hoped. The stock has since plummeted to $25, and it now has to triple before conversion makes sense. So it's looking as though Calpine will be liable for the $1 billion in borrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April. There's also the refinancing cost. According to Kelly, Calpine's borrowing rate could run in the neighborhood of 8.5%--an extra $85 million per year in cash. ""Obviously, nobody plans for their stock to go down,"" Kelly says. ""I don't think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put."" 
Calpine's potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating is straddling junk. ""If you are a borderline investment-grade company, a financing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the world,"" notes Anand Iyer, head of global convertible research at Morgan Stanley. The problem is, there are a slew of companies with far worse credit ratings out there: Jeff Seidel, Credit Suisse First Boston's head of convertible-bond research, estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall into the junk category. And others are at risk of having their ratings downgraded before the put date. Today, with junk yielding as much as 5 1/2 percentage points above bonds rated investment grade, refinancing can be a pricey proposition. 
Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high price of junk. It has $845 million in zeros that it will probably have to buy back this January, and another $4.2 billion coming down the pike over the next couple of years. Because of slower- than-expected sales, the company was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies. And if Solectron's credit is downgraded, the zeros would slide into junk status, a situation that could cost the company--and its shareholders--tens of millions of dollars in refinancing charges. 
Refinancing isn't the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros. Companies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds--up to 3% of the amount raised. If the debt is sold back, many will have spent millions for what essentially amounted to a one-year loan. ""They're getting bad advice,"" claims one banker who didn't want to be named. ""Look at the fee the banker earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into."" 
As if those potential consequences were not scary enough, shareholders can also get whacked when the bonds are first issued. That's because some 40% are bought by hedge funds, which short the company's stock (sell borrowed shares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price) at the same time that they buy the bonds. If the stock goes down, the shorts make money from their position. If it goes up, they profit by converting the bond to stock. This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet, at least for a while. Grocery chain Supervalu, for example, recently lost 10% of its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $185 million in zeros. 
Despite all the pitfalls, the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continues, thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they provide. In fact, the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form of financing. Even better, thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code, companies can rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they're actually paying. All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest if certain conditions prevail. Verizon Communications, for instance, would pay 0.25% annual interest on its $3 billion in zero bonds if its stock price falls below 60% of the issue's conversion price. In the eyes of the IRS, oddly, that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction, for tax purposes, of 7.5%--the same rate it pays on its regular debt. (Why? Trust us, you don't want to know.) That adds up to an annual deduction of more than $200 million, even if Verizon never shells out a dime in interest. Not surprisingly, more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain similar clauses. ""It's an incredible deal for them,"" says Vadim Iosilevich, who runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management. ""Not only are they raising cheap money, they're also doing tax arbitrage."" 
So despite the enormous risks to shareholders, companies continue to issue zeros at a steady clip: According to ConvertBond.com, seven new issues, totaling $3.5 billion, have been sold since Oct. 1 alone. ""I think the power of the tax advantage is going to keep them around,"" says CSFB's Seidel. Call it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly--it doesn't really matter. Either way, it's the shareholders who'll be left paying the bill.

When zero is a negative number 
The danger posed by convertible zero bonds depends on a number of factors, according to Morgan Stanley's ConvertBond.com: the size of the bond, the put date, the company's credit rating and cash on hand, and how far the stock must rise for the bond to convert to equity.

Solectron 1/27/02 $845 $2,800 $13.25 155% Investment grade In the danger zone. May be downgraded to junk if results don't improve. Has additional $4.2 billion at risk in 2003 and 2004. 
Calpine 4/30/02 $1,000 $1,242 $25.50 180% Inv. grade/Junk Possibly a pricey tab. On the border between investment grade and junk, the energy company faces high refinancing charges.

Western Digital 2/18/03 $126 $201 $4.25 547% Junk Hard drive ahead. The tech outfit has already paid down some of its zeros by issuing stock. More dilution possible. 
Brightpoint 3/11/03 $138 $67 $3.25 609% Junk Watch out. This mobile-phone distributor plans to repurchase the bonds and is likely to incur high refinancing charges.

Verizon 5/15/04 $3,270 $3,000 $50.00 70% Investment grade Verizon faces little risk because of its strong credit rating and the long lead time on its put dates.

Manager's Journal: What Enron Did Right
By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy. 
Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage.
We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation. We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is needed. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value. 
-- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and electric power industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of bidding by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit. Enron was the leader in pioneering this business. 
Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S., and is spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have been consumers, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The contrary experience of California, the poster child of those who would re-regulate the power industry, is an example of not enough deregulation. 
-- Innovation and the ""de-integration"" of power contracts. Under the old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were offered a one-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system was inflexible and inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer. 
To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc., and offered customers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's investors did too, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors. Arguably, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the ""process of Creative Destruction."" But creative destroyers are not necessarily likable, pleasant folks, which may be part of Enron's problem today. 
-- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended the logic of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper company, for instance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate activities better than smaller, specialized firms. Enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of ""customers"" and ""suppliers."" Enron envisioned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the bet that the free-market terms would be better than those of the internal operations. The development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by which divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the economy. 
-- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated environment, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pipeline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a number of possible sources, opening the customer to the benefits of competition, and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies. Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network, so that they could nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use, and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons. This policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tremendous value for both customers and suppliers. 
-- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the trading risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal controls. Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among the best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of Enron Online, where Enron made new positions valued at over $4 billion each day, it became essential to have up-to-the-second information on company-wide positions, prices and ability to deliver. 
The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's ability to finance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite, counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance. It was the erosion in equity, rather than trading risk, that destroyed the firm. 
-- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal, slow, and full of excuses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company -- Enron only 15 years ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron became bumptious, impatient, lean, fast, innovative, and demanding. It bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses, create markets, and transfer within the firm. 
Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and an open-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs. This was a lightning rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could serve as a model for more hide-bound enterprises to emulate. 
Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformation of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet corners of the business economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in which it did business. It thrived on volatility. 
The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D establishment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover following Enron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time-consuming antitrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enron's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all should hope, because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake their industries.

J.P. Morgan Wins (by Not Losing as Much)
By Susanne Craig
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

You know things are bad on Wall Street when the winner of a stock-selection contest can't come close to breaking even. 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s portfolio was the only one in The Wall Street Journal's quarterly stock-picking survey to slide less than 10% during the three months ended Sept. 30. The value of its stock basket fell 8.6% during the third quarter.
Just six of the 15 financial firms managed to beat the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which dropped 14.7% during the period. Among the star performers that came to J.P. Morgan's rescue: Northrop Grumman Corp., SBC Communications Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co. 
""It has turned into a real stock-picker's market,"" says J.P. Morgan equity strategist Douglas Cliggott. ""In the first half, the market bought cyclical stocks, such as credit cards and brokers, in hopes of a recovery. We don't think those stocks will get interesting until sometime in 2003."" Instead, the firm's portfolio is weighted toward health care and consumer staples, as well as cyclical stocks such as energy and farm equipment. 
The quarter was among the roughest in years for Wall Street investors. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 helped contribute to the stock-market losses, which drove down the value of all portfolios in the survey, though the markets have since recovered to their pre-Sept. 11 levels. The last time the group posted results this bad was during the third quarter of 1998, during the Asian financial crisis. 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston finished at the bottom of the pack, falling 23.2% and 30.1% respectively. The performance of last-place finisher CSFB was dragged down by losses at companies such as Veritas Software Corp. (down 72.3% in the quarter), Praecis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (down 64.8%) and software provider Amdocs Ltd. (down 51%). 
For CSFB, ""it was not a good stock-picking quarter, that's for sure,"" says Al Jackson, the firm's global head of equity research. ""It was our tech and telecom . . . and the events of Sept. 11 that hurt us."" 
Credit Suisse First Boston recently changed the approach to its model portfolio, opting against sector weightings, Mr. Jackson says. This strategy has hurt CSFB in recent quarters, because of the steep slump in areas such as technology and telecom. The firm recently added a number of Old Economy stocks to its portfolio, such as Citigroup Inc., Dow Chemical Co. and Gannett Co. Says Mr. Jackson: ""We are going back to our roots and asking what our best ideas are."" 
Like CSFB, Goldman was hit by a drop in the share price of technology companies, such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (down 56.5% in the quarter). Its portfolio was also dragged down by shares of embattled Enron Corp. (down 44.3%). Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada's RBC Dain Rauscher, which placed 6th and 12th respectively, also have the energy company on their lists. 
In addition to Enron, stocks hard it by the terrorist attacks, such as lodging giant Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Walt Disney Co. and airlines such as Skywest Inc., also hurt the portfolio performance of many securities firms. 
It is unlikely people will buy any company's entire recommended list at one time. The Journal survey is intended to give investors an idea of how their portfolio would look if they let the professionals do all the picking. Calculations in the quarterly survey, done for the Journal by Zacks Investment Research in Chicago, take into account capital gains or losses, dividends and theoretical commissions of 1% on each trade. 
Overall, Edward D. Jones & Co., of St. Louis, emerged with the most consistent results across the board, placing second in the quarter and for the year. Its 85% return over five years is the best of the group and ahead of the total return for the S&P 500 of 62.7%. Perhaps more than any other firm, Edwards Jones takes a buy-and-hold approach to investing, making very few changes to its portfolio from quarter to quarter, or even year to year. 
""It's the old story of the tortoise and the hare, and we believe slow and steady wins the race,"" says David Otto, Edward Jones director of research. ""We are really, really proud of the five-year number. We believe in getting rich, slowly."" 
On a quarterly basis, the portfolio of Prudential Securities Inc., a unit of Prudential Financial, came in second only to J.P. Morgan, falling 11.8%. However, investors sitting with the stocks Prudential recommends haven't done as well in the long run. The value of its basket of stocks has fallen 45.9% in the past year, finishing ahead of only Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which posted a one-year loss of 54.9%. 
Seven firms managed to beat the S&P 500 index during the past 12 months, which fell 26.6% in the period. 
Lehman, which finished last in the survey in the second quarter thanks to its heavy weighting in technology, managed to move up in the rankings this quarter. This primarily stemmed from its annual shuffle of the 10 stocks in its portfolio, known as its ""Ten Uncommon Values."" This time around, the firm's portfolio slipped 18.4% in the quarter, for an 11th place finish. Just one of its 10 stocks, Washington Mutual Inc., managed to eke out a positive return, of 3.1%. Its biggest quarterly loser: Energy company Mirant Corp., which fell 36.3% in the period. 
""It's a portfolio that has done decently since the market troughed,"" says Jeff Applegate, Lehman's chief market strategist. He says he believes the market hit bottom Sept. 21.

German Bank Is in Talks With Enron To Buy a Unit
By SUZANNE KAPNER

11/19/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

LONDON, Nov. 18 -- A large German bank is in talks to buy Wessex Water from the Enron Corporation, people close to the discussions said today. 
Enron is looking to sell Wessex Water, of Britain, as well as other noncore assets in India and Brazil, after a financial crisis nearly brought its main energy trading business to a halt. That crisis led to Enron's decision earlier this month to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., a much smaller rival.
The German Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Dusseldorf, or WestLB, is among several suitors for Wessex Water, people close to the discussions said. The sale has also attracted the attention of industry rivals like Thames Water, owned by RWE of Germany. But such a combination would most likely incur a long review by regulators, who might either block the merger on antitrust grounds, or exact stiff concessions, industry experts said. 
Wessex Water is likely to be sold for more than $:1 billion ($1.4 billion) but less than the $:1.4 billion that Enron paid for it in 1998, analysts said. 
''In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, told analysts in a conference call last week. Those investments ''have performed far worse than we ever could have imagined,'' he said, citing the Azurix water business, of which Wessex Water is a part, and energy assets in Brazil and India. 
Executives from Enron were not immediately available for comment today. WestLB executives declined to comment. 
WestLB has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Britain, bidding for British Telecommunications' phone network and the nation's railway tracks controlled by the troubled Railtrack, which is restructuring under government supervision. Neither of those bids has progressed beyond the initial stages. 
Last summer, WestLB helped finance the management buyout of the Mid Kent Water Company through Swan Capital, its private equity vehicle.

Credit Markets
Bond Boom Isn't Likely to Lift Economy As Corporations Swap Old Debt for New
By Jathon Sapsford
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

When AT&T last week completed the second-biggest bond sale in history -- capping one of the busiest bond periods in years -- it came as welcome news amid fears of a credit crunch. Here was new money, meaning new spending on plants, equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump. 
That $10.9 billion AT&T deal, and a slew of similar bond deals from big companies ranging from Boeing and Anheuser-Busch to Kraft Foods and General Motors, may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on. That is because corporations, like homeowners, are in the midst of a refinancing boom.
Corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap, but because they often can't get money in other crucial markets. In particular, they are sidestepping the commercial paper market -- short-term corporate IOUs used to finance day-to-day operations, where rates traditionally are lowest -- because investors are unwilling to finance many well-known corporations. 
The result has been a huge jump in bond sales, the majority of which are used to reduce existing debt. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, about $135 billion in investment-grade bonds have been sold, up from about $78 billion in the year-earlier period. Overall issuance this year is likely to set a record, clearing $600 billion, compared with $411 billion in 2000. 
""The driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short-term commercial paper to long-term debt,"" says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service, a credit-rating agency. 
Usually, rising bond issuance presages economic growth. In 1991, corporations sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates. But then, companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operations, a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1990s. 
This time around, the surge in bond deals won't pump in enough new money to the economy to make a dramatic difference. Though, as in the case of the millions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly payments, it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate-balance sheets and help to fund some of the companies' day-to-day operations. 
Not all of the money being raised is to refinance short-term debt, of course, and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation's biggest borrowers have ready access to funding if they need it. 
But most companies are similar to AT&T, which last week provided the biggest refinancing example yet. 
Over the next three months, the telecom company was facing $6.5 billion in expiring commercial paper. Under normal conditions, corporations pay off maturing commercial paper by ""rolling over"" that debt, or issuing new commercial paper to replace the old. But rolling over commercial paper became much harder for AT&T after Moody's cut the company's short-term and long-term credit ratings. Through the bond deal, AT&T raised money at relatively attractive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial-paper market. 
Other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives to the commercial-paper market through bonds, loans or revolving credit lines. ""The ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital markets,"" says Meredith Coffey, senior vice president at Loan Pricing Corp., a debt-market-analysis company. 
For the most extreme cases, the bond markets don't offer refuge. Enron, hammered by a third-quarter loss of $618 million that led to a string of downgrades, drew down $3.3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay investors in its commercial paper. It then turned to its banks for an additional $1 billion loan to pay off more commercial-paper investors, thus tiding it over until it could merge with rival Dynegy. 
Most investment-grade companies aren't nearly so bad off, and thus have ready access to bond investors. General Motors, for instance, had little trouble selling $6 billion in debt last month, while Ford Motor easily sold bonds totalling $9.4 billion. 
But the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment-grade companies are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their money. 
Take Ford. Standard & Poor's and Moody's downgraded Ford's debt ratings last month to triple-B-plus and single-A-3, respectively. With that rating, Ford is far enough down the spectrum of investment-grade debt that many of the ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won't touch it, meaning that it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt. Ford concedes that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the commercial-paper market. 
Boyce Greer, the money-market group leader at Fidelity Investments, says he often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign of eroding profitability -- even before they get downgraded. ""You can't wait around for a rating agency [to downgrade a company],"" he says. 
Moody's has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so far this year. Thus, the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk to $1.4 trillion at the end of October, down from $1.6 trillion at the end of last year.

Friday's Credit Markets 
Last week was a brutal time to own Treasurys. The market sold off so sharply as to push yields, which move inversely to prices, almost back up to where they stood before the terrorist attacks. It was the worst bond selloff since 1987, according to economists at Banc One Capital Markets. 
Losses were heaviest in issues like the two-year note, the most sensitive to expectations about Federal Reserve policy. Since hitting a record low of 2.30% on Nov. 7, the two-year yield has risen 0.80 percentage point to 3.05%. In the same period, the 30-year bond yield has risen 0.50 percentage point to 5.27%. 
At 4 p.m. Friday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 1 3/32 points from late Thursday, or $10.94 per $1,000 face value, at 100 25/32. Its yield jumped to 4.897% from 4.756% Thursday. 
The 30-year Treasury bond's price fell 1 19/32 to 100 25/32 to yield 5.317, up from 5.211% Thursday. 
Why the selloff? People in the market cite a shift toward the view that the U.S. economy may finally be on the brink of recovery. That means the Fed may not need to employ many more rate cuts to get growth back on track.

Enron Corp. investors hope the energy trader's third-quarter report to the Securities and Exchange Commission will answer some of the questions that sent its shares tumbling and led to a proposed sale to rival Dynegy Inc. 
Enron, which has been criticized for failing to clearly explain how it makes money, may disclose in a filing expected today more on how much is owed by the company and affiliated partnerships, as well as any planned job cuts and other cost-saving moves related to Dynegy's $24-billion buyout.
Enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67% in three weeks amid an SEC investigation into partnerships run by Enron executives. Investors worry that new disclosures, such as previously unreported debt, might threaten Enron's credit rating and scuttle the merger, possibly pushing Enron into bankruptcy. 
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay acknowledged last week that failed investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to Dynegy, and he and other executives pledged to be more open with investors. 
Enron shares fell 48 cents Friday to close at $9 on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy fell $1.53 to $42.47. 
Enron's third-quarter earnings report, which had been expected last week, was delayed by the Dynegy talks and a restatement of earnings, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said. 
Enron reduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million to include losses from affiliated partnerships. 
Today's filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheet summarizing assets and debts. Enron for years has omitted balance sheets, which the SEC requires as part of the 10-Q, from its press releases announcing earnings.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Dynegy bid faces long wait.
By NANCY DUNNE and ANDREW HILL.

Dynegy's $9.8bn rescue bid for Enron, the larger rival energy group, poses complex and unprecedented regulatory challenges for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Ferc), which is likely to lead the review of the bid. 
Officials from the two Houston-based companies, which announced the deal 10 days ago, estimated the regulatory process would take six to nine months to complete.
But the Ferc review could take longer, according to experts, and approval of the deal is further complicated by such issues as the parallel Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Enron's finances. 
""It's very complicated. It will be very time-consuming,"" said one person close to the Ferc commissioners. As of Friday, the groups had not yet filed for Ferc approval. 
""(The deal) raises issues that have never been considered before by Ferc,"" said Edward Comer, general counsel to the Edison Electric Institute, the association of US electric utilities. 
""It has never considered the merger of two huge marketers, and in the past, marketing wasn't considered as significant a portion of the energy sector as it has become."" 
A typical deal now takes about 200 days to win Ferc approval. But Mr Comer said approval of the Dynegy bid could take anywhere from six months to two years. 
The agency's guidelines prohibit mergers if they give the new company the market power to push prices above competitive levels for ""a significant period of time"". 
It analyses market power by identifying the products sold, the customers and suppliers affected and market concentration. 
""Mergers in the past have been considered on the basis of assets,"" said Patti Harper-Slaboszewicz of Frost & Sullivan, a market research and consulting firm. ""The rules were written when the industry was vertically integrated."" 
Now the question is how ownership of energy trading services will be calculated. It could be difficult to assess if the companies are exerting market power because information on the trading books of companies such as Enron and Dynegy is closely guarded, she said. 
The two companies must also win consent from either the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission, and from states where the companies have pipelines and provide retail services.

Fund Track
Russia Fund Surges Amid Global Woes
By Victoria Marcinkowski
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal
C17
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Everything is relative in the investing world, so with U.S. investors nervous about homeland stocks, European and Asian markets sagging and terrorism worries abounding, Russia's risky markets seem less so these days. 
So far this year, Pilgrim Russia Fund, which was bought by ING Groep NV late last year, has been the top-performing regional mutual fund, gaining 53%, according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc. By comparison, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has slumped nearly 14%.
Of course, the risks in Russia remain. Despite recent economic gains, the country still is struggling with a weak banking system, inadequate state institutions to enforce contract laws and few businesses run by the ""modern"" rules of corporate governance, according to Samuel Oubadia the 37-year-old manager of the Russia fund. 
""But they are getting more open,"" Mr. Oubadia said, though Russia's lax financial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign investors. With $49 million in assets, the Pilgrim Russia fund invests between 90% and 95% in Russian stock, with the balance held in cash. 
""While the global economy is slowing, Russia is still in an expansion mode,"" Mr. Oubadia said. After years of economic reforms, consumer spending is up 10% and the former Soviet Union's gross domestic product is expected to grow 3% to 5% next year, more than twice as much as that of the U.S. and Europe. 
Two-thirds of the fund's stocks are oil and gas companies, which are still the most liquid stocks in Russia. Utilities, mining, telecommunications companies and breweries make up the rest. ""There's no escaping oil and gas if you want to manage a Russia fund,"" Mr. Oubadia said. 
The spike in oil prices earlier this year made the investment in oil worthwhile, propelling earnings growth for Russia's oil and gas companies. Higher oil prices also worked wonders for the Russian economy, which is largely dependent on oil and gas. More recently, however, falling oil prices have threatened the companies' profit growth. 
But the fund manager, who is based in The Hague, said he doesn't think people should invest in Russian oil stocks because of their earnings prospects. ""You don't invest because of earnings growth -- there will be none for Russian oil companies this year. You invest because of the stocks' low valuation,"" Mr. Oubadia said, adding that most of the Russian oil companies still trade well below the world-wide average for the sector. 
Yukos Oil is one of the fund's largest investments, making up about 12% of the fund's holdings. Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil Holdings also make up more than 5% each of Pilgrim Russia's assets. While Mr. Oubadia said the companies should be able to handle falling oil prices, partly by cutting production, he worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile Russian stock market that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks. 
""Can Russian markets do well with lower prices for oil?"" he asked. ""The short answer is yes. But how low will prices drop?"" Mr. Oubadia acknowledged that weak oil prices might cause him to shift some investments from oil and gas into other Russian sectors, including telecom stocks and consumer products. 
The Russia fund isn't for the timid. In 1998, when the Russian economy collapsed, the fund -- then called Lexington Troika Dialog Russia, lost 83% of its value. A year later, the fund soared 160%. In 2000 the fund finished down almost 18%.

JANUS STOCK SHUFFLE: Janus Capital Corp. bulked up on lower-priced value stocks and shed some shares of its long-held technology companies during the third quarter, a new Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed. 
The Denver fund firm reported that during the third quarter, it lowered its investments in 14 of the 20 largest holdings it had owned as of June 30. The largest reduction was a 43.6 million-share sale of Nokia Corp. stock. After the sale, Janus still owned a large 183.2 million-share position in the wireless-phone company at the end of the third quarter. 
During the quarter, Janus also sold more than half of its stakes in tech companies EMC Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. In addition, the fund company, a unit of Stilwell Financial Inc., trimmed its exposure to energy company Enron Corp., selling 1.5 million shares to reduce its overall position to 41.4 million shares at the end of September. 
On the buying side, Janus, one of the hottest fund firms of the late 1990s thanks to bets on leading technology stocks, about doubled its position in software company Microsoft Corp. It also boosted its holding in the investment company run by Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., while starting a small position in Philip Morris Cos., whose dividend-rich stock is usually more popular with price-sensitive ""value"" managers. Janus has introduced new value portfolios recently, but most of its investors' assets still follow faster-growing companies.

Wessex Water

11/19/2001
The Financial News
Copyright (C) 2001 The Financial News; Source: World Reporter (TM)

The Sunday Telegraph 
The German state-owned bank, WestLB, is in talks to buy Wessex Water from its troubled US parent Enron.
WestLB is thought to be one of a number of financial buyers to have approached Enron with a view to acquiring Wessex, which is valued at more than AGBP1bn (e1.63bn). 
Enron, the energy trading group which bought Wessex in 1998 for AGBP1.4bn, is being bought by its much smaller US rival Dynegy after collapsing into financial crisis. 
The Independent on Sunday 
The water and sewage company Wessex Water is understood to be up for sale following an offer to take over its owner, Enron. 
Three years ago, Enron spent AGBP1.4bn on Wessex Water. 
But Dynegy is understood to want to concentrate on US and European energy assets and is not interested in non-core assets. 
Any hope to regain the same amount of money could be derailed as the industry is put off by regulatory problems, and the company's results have worsened due to imposed price cuts over the past year.

India BSES:Dabhol Pwr Proj Due Diligence Done Jan -Report

11/19/2001
Emerging Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's BSES Ltd. (P.BSX) said Monday due diligence on the 2,184 megawatt Dabhol power project is expected to be completed by January 2002, the Press Trust of India news agency reported. 
""The due diligence process will take six-eight weeks after signing of the confidentiality agreement with Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Co.,"" the report said, quoting BSES' Chairman and Managing Director R.V. Shahi.
The U.S.-based energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) has a controlling 65% stake in the Dabhol power project located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. 
The Maharashtra State Electricity Board, or MSEB, has 15%, while U.S.-based companies General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL) each own 10% in DPC. 
Enron wants to sell its stake in DPC because of payment defaults by its sole customer, the MSEB, and the Indian federal government's failure to honor payment guarantees. 
In August, the U.S. company said it was willing to sell its stake at cost. 
BSES would appoint three separate consultants for technical, financial and legal due diligence on the Dabhol project, Shahi said. 
After signing the confidentiality agreement, BSES will formally look into the books of DPC, its loans, sponsors and other assets and legal wrangles before deciding on the acquisition price of the company, the report said. 
The Dabhol project, at a cost of $2.9 billion, is India's largest single foreign investment to date.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Dabhol Power Co. will wait for the Bombay High Court's verdict before sending a final termination notice to its sole customer - the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, a source close to the company told Dow Jones Newswires Monday. 
""Nothing is going to happen until Dec. 3. The Bombay High Court has adjourned all proceedings...(and)...DPC will wait for the court's verdict before deciding its future course of action,"" said the source.
Enron Corp. (ENE) has a controlling 65% stake in the 2,184-megawatt Dabhol power project in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. Enron wants to sell its stake in DPC because of payment defaults by the MSEB and the Indian federal government's failure to honor payment guarantees. In August, the U.S. company said it was willing to sell its equity at cost. 
At $2.9 billion, Dabhol is India's largest single foreign investment to date. MSEB has 15%, while U.S.-based companies General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL) own 10% each in DPC.

Fears raised on Enron deal: $15.6-billion rescue bid

NEW YORK - Companies that trade with Enron Corp., the Houston, Texas-based energy group, are taking precautions in case Dynegy Inc., also of Houston, withdraws its $15.6-billion rescue bid for its rival, a decision that could trigger a crisis in the energy trading market. 
Counter-parties to Enron, which is one of the principal market-makers providing liquidity in the energy market, are seeking to limit their exposure to the group, in spite of reassurances from both Enron and Dynegy that the takeover will go through.
Experts also say the implications of the deal are so complex that the regulatory review could take much longer than the six to nine months company officials have estimated. 
Analysts say the 27% spread between the value of Dynegy's offer price and Enron's share price suggests a 65% to 75% chance the bid will succeed. But bankers and energy executives are still worried about systemic risk, both in the energy market and in financial markets, where companies such as Enron use derivatives to offset the risk of energy price fluctuations. 
Enron was close to meltdown until Dynegy stepped in with a rescue bid 10 days ago, having persuaded credit rating agencies not to downgrade Enron's debt to below investment grade. 
Clauses built into the merger agreement signed with Enron give Dynegy the right to walk away under certain circumstances, although the two companies' officials and advisors differ on how easy it would be for Dynegy to pull out. 
While the situation remains uncertain, companies that deal with Enron are reluctant to lock themselves into long-term contracts to buy or sell power, said John Olson, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris, the investment banking arm of Houston, Texas-based Sanders Morris Harris Group. 
Keith Stamm, chief executive of Aquila Inc., the energy marketing and risk-management company, said his company had begun preparing contingency plans in case the deal fell through.

Blackout in the power sector
A V Rajwade

11/19/2001
Business Standard
10
Copyright (c) Business Standard

Every foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit. Of these, the most controversial has been Enron and its Dabhol Power Company Ltd (DPCL). This apart, the experience of investors in the ""reformed"" power sector in Orissa is also unhappy. Five years ago, Orissa was the first state to adopt the World Bank-recommended model of separating generation, transmission and distribution of power, and an independent regulator. The Godbole Committee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well. 
Clearly, separating the three functions is a complex restructuring. Maybe it helps privatisation, the current fashion on the subject having been set in Thatcherite Britain. While some privatisations in UK have succeeded, the experience has not been consistent all over.
Take UK's rail sector. While privatising, the government in its wisdom decided to separate the ownership of the rail network (Railtrack) and the ownership and operation of trains. The contractual relationship between the various operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine, bewilderingly complex system of penalties and incentives, to be monitored by an independent regulator. 
Such separation had no parallel. Besides, Railtrack suffered from poor management, cost escalation in modernisation of tracks, etc. Several serious accidents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult. The ""reform"" did not work, and Railtrack was put back under public control last month. 
What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeeding? Pretty poor, if the experience of Orissa is any guide. It faithfully separated the three functions, and privatised distribution and part of generation. AES, a foreign company, was 49 per cent investor in a generating company, and 51 per cent in CESCO, a distribution company. As Gajendra Haldea analysed in this paper on August 27, ""The policy and regulatory framework was inadequate and myopic."" 
Distribution losses, a euphemism for power theft, were much larger than the companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation. CESCO defaulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO, the transmission company, which in turn defaulted to the generating company. Indeed, all CESCO's cash inflows are now escrowed, leaving it no money even to pay salaries. For all practical purposes, the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation, perhaps beyond redemption, and the ""reform"" is a total mess. 
The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified SEB is less efficient than trifurcated companies it is the political unwillingness to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers. For a while, cross subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the household and the agricultural segments. 
However, as the burden became too large, the commercial sector started moving to captive generation, further worsening SEB finances. An ""independent"" regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem. He may fix economic prices but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors, punish power thiefs, face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is cut off? So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative, as, sadly, they are, the institutional restructuring is no substitute for substantive action. No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to get out! 
Enron too wants out but it has many more problems in its home country, over and above its dispute with MSEB. It had attracted a lot of adverse publicity for gouging power consumers in California, a state in a power crisis (see World Money, February 2, 2001). The Internet craze also had a hand in Enron's misfortunes. It became an energy trader, established an electronic trading platform, had broadband ambitions, went into a disastrous diversification in water supplies which, if I remember correctly, led to Rebecca Mark's exit. Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skilling, ex-McKinsey, and was notorious for opaque, complex accounts. 
To top it all, last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary $1.2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial activities. Enron's chief financial officer, who was supposed to be in charge of these, has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated with him was involved in them. The SEC is investigating the affair and Enron's share price is down 67 per cent since mid-October. There are some reports that Shell may make a bid for Enron. 
After its ratings were downgraded, Enron is desperate for liquidity and anxious to dispose its assets. DPCL was already on the platter; now a sale has become even more urgent. Reportedly, Tatas and BSES are interested; so are the lending institutions. Clearly, if a settlement is to be reached, this is the optimum time. 
But one is not very optimistic. For one, Delhi and Mumbai will be involved, and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs. Our byzantine decision-making processes make timely decisions impossible. Further, if a deal does take place, there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption. It is much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and Delhi to allow the drift to continue, to ""let the law take its own course"", whatever the costs! Sadly, as Jairam Ramesh said in this paper, Indian politicians respond to developments only out of compulsion, not conviction.

to
> let you know you have won a  wonderful prize, etc. In each case, you
are

from

> phone as long as possible to increase the charges. Unfortunately,  when
you
> get your phone bill, you'll often be charged more than  $24100.00.
> WHY IT WORKS:
> The 809 area code is located in the  British Virgin Islands (The
Bahamas).
> The 809 area code can be used  as a ""pay-per-call"" number, similar to
900
> numbers in the US. Since  809 is not in the US, it is not covered by
U.S.
> regulations of 900  numbers, which require that you be notified and
warned
> of charges  and rates involved when you call a pay-per-call"" number.
There
> is  also no requirement that the company provide a time period  during
which
> you may terminate the call without being charged.  Further, whereas
many
> U.S.  homes that have 900 number  blocking to avoid these kinds of
charges,
> do not work in preventing  calls to the 809 area code. We recommend
that no
> matter how you get  The message, if you are asked to call a number with
an
> 809 area  code that you don't recognize just disregard the message. Be

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) expects at least two bidders to come in Monday with offers to jump-start the energy company's trading operations.
""We expect bids today. Probably two or more,"" said Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer who represents Enron in its bankruptcy proceedings in New York. 
Bienenstock declined to identify possible bidders. 
But a person familiar with the matter said that Citigroup (C), one of Enron's main creditors, would likely be among those bidding for Enron's trading assets. 
Bids are due by 4 p.m. EST Monday. An auction will be held Thursday.

Enron Trading Ops - 2: Bids Won't Include Cash

01/07/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Under a plan designed to bring back some value to its trading operations - including EnronOnline which, until not so long ago, accounted for 25% of all wholesale energy trading in the U.S. - Enron has been looking for a 51% partner with great credit worthiness to form a joint venture. 
Under the joint venture, dubbed New Energy Trading Operations, or NETCO, Enron and its partner would be sharing revenue.
The deal is crucial to Enron's creditors, including Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM), because it's seen as key for those lenders and others to recoup some of the money lost in the Enron's meltdown. 
Citigroup was first expected to emerge as a stalking horse that could have flamed interest from other parties. But that didn't happened. Swiss banking giant UBS AG (UBS) and Goldman Sachs Group (GS) and American International Group Inc. (AIG) have also been reported as a potential bidders. 
Enron's lawyer Bienenstock said that he didn't expect the bids to include any financial payments from the outside parties. 
""This is not about money,"" Bienenstock said. ""We're getting creditworthiness and they're getting a gigantic value in assets."" 
Enron hopes that an alliance with a big-name bidder like Citigroup, UBS or Goldman would bring back customers who began fleeing Enron's trading floors in November when prospects of a merger between Enron and rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN) started fading. 
Although Enron has said that it was looking for a 51% partner, the final structure of the venture may vary depending on the bidders' needs, Bienenstock said. 
""Each bidder has its own particular needs and own desires,"" the Enron lawyer said. 
Court documents show that Enron intends to contribute software and hardware to NETCO, not specifying what exact assets are up for grab. 
Bienenstock said he didn't expect a lawsuit brought by software company Solarc Inc. against Enron for copyright infringement to complicate the bidding process. 
""If there was infringement, that could be offset against future distribution"" of revenue, he said. 
Each bidder will have to make a $25 million deposit to prove the validity of its offer. But that deposit will be returned if a bid isn't accepted or if no cash contribution is part of the actual offer. 
Meanwhile, this week's bidding process will likely affect how much financing Enron gets at the end of the month. 
The energy company is now expected to receive less than the $1.5 billion in debtor-in-possession financing first agreed to after it filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2. 
As reported, Enron's better-than-expected cash position, now seen around $400 million to $500 million, and continued reluctance by Wall Street to back a new Enron loan are likely to contribute to a much smaller DIP package. 
""We haven't discussed it yet,"" Bienenstock said of the new DIP plan. 
Final approval of the interim financing is scheduled for Jan. 30.

Enron fighting push to move bankruptcy case here
The Houston Chronicle
Jan. 7, 1:58 PM

NEW YORK - Enron Corp. is fighting a push by creditors to move the former energy trading giant's bankruptcy case from New York to its hometown of Houston.

Many of the creditors are located in the Houston area or others parts of the West. They were to be heard today by a bankruptcy judge in New York, where Enron filed for Chapter 11 protection. 
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez said today as the hearing began that he doesn't intend to rule today but expects to do so by the end of the week.

Large creditors, such as energy traders Dynegy and El Paso Corp., and smaller ones, like the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of Colorado, believe it would be more convenient and economical to hear the case near the location of many Enron creditors and assets. Dynegy and El Paso are based in Houston.

In a motion filed by Dynegy and other creditors, lawyers also say there is ""an emotional interest to be served"" by moving the case to Houston, where thousands of Enron employees were laid off and many more witnessed the rapid evaporation of their retirement plans when the company's stock plummeted.

Also today, at least two companies were expected to make bids for a majority stake in Enron's wholesale energy trading unit, a lawyer for the company said.

Enron lawyer Martin Bienenstock, of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP in New York, said he expects Enron's core business, which needs a credit-worthy partner to resume operations, to fetch ""probably two bids or more"" by the 4 p.m. deadline. An auction is scheduled for Thursday. 
With regard to the change-of-venue hearing, analysts say creditors are also hoping for a potentially more favorable hearing in Houston, whose economy has suffered as a result of Enron's demise.

Lawyers for Enron, and a handful of creditors opposed to relocating the proceedings, are expected to argue that it would be less expensive and more accomodating if the case were administered in New York, home to the armies of lawyers and bankers working on both sides. 
Howard B. Comet, an attorney for Weil, Gotshal and Manges, said it would also be easier for business partners and potential witnesses involved in Enron's worldwide operations to participate if the proceedings took place in New York.

""The focus of the financial restructuring is here,"" Comet said.

Citigroup Inc. of New York, Barclays Bank PLC of London and Dresdner Bank AG of Frankfurt are among the creditors opposed to changing venues.

Under the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure, a case may be transferred from one district court to another ""in the interest of justice or for the convenience of the parties."" The basic criteria considered by judges ruling on previous change-of-venue motions have been: the proximity of creditors, debtors and witnesses; the location of assets, and the cost.

""Judges have considerable discretion in making the call,"" said Robert Christmas, a bankruptcy expert with the law firm Nixon Peabody LLP in New York.

Christmas said moving the case to Houston would create ""an atmosphere of pressure that does not exist in New York.""

""That gives creditors the ability to have unhappy employees tramping around the courthouse,"" he said.

Christmas said few cases of this size have ever been moved, but that Judge Gonzalez could be swayed by the fact that so many of Enron's energy-trading partners are located in and around Houston.

Cases have been moved in the past if there were a lot of small creditors based in one area. However, new technologies have made it possible for interested parties to participate in the proceedings from thousands of miles away. For example, Houston-based lawyers for Enron creditors gave testimony last week via teleconference.

Enron collapsed late last year when revelations of questionable accounting practices and mounting debt caused investors and traders to lose confidence in the company. Its stock price, trading above $85 a year ago, is now firmly below $1 per share.

Enron's filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law on Dec. 2 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. One of the company's smaller subsidiaries, Enron Metals and Commodity Corp., is based there.

Lawyers for the Southern Ute tribe, a natural gas supplier, said the decision to file for bankruptcy in New York ""is indicative of Enron's desperation to avoid facing the facts at its home in Houston.""

Enron Plans to Release 4th-Quarter Results, Balance Sheet in March

01/07/2002

Dow Jones Newswires 
NEW YORK -- Enron Corp. doesn't plan to announce its fourth-quarter results until March and breaking with past practice, will also release its balance sheet at the same time, according to company spokesman Mark Palmer.
In the past, Enron (ENE), once the largest trader of energy in the U.S., issued its financial results shortly after the close of the quarter. However, the company normally doesn't release its balance sheet until weeks later, in its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The idea is to announce the results and file with the SEC at the same time, Mr. Palmer said on Monday. 
Enron, which filed for bankruptcy in early December, was criticized by some investors for not providing enough information in its earnings reports. 
The Houston-based energy trader caught investors off guard when it reported a $618 million loss in the third quarter, and a sharp reduction in shareholder equity related to the unwinding of a financial partnership with its former chief financial officer. In the days that followed, information about the company's financial situation continued to be uncovered. 
Eventually, Enron was forced to restate earnings for several years, reducing its net income during the period by several hundred million dollars.

Enron Shareholders File Class Action Lawsuit Vs Dynegy
By Erwin Seba

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Two Enron Corp. (ENE) shareholders filed a class action lawsuit Thursday against Dynegy Inc. (DYN) in Harris County District Court in Houston.
The shareholders allege they were harmed, as potential third-party beneficiaries, when Dynegy canceled a proposed merger with Enron in November of last year. 
""Dynegy breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing by, among other things, its wrongful termination of the merger agreement, its failure to continue with and diligently pursue the merger, its falsely representing that it was conducting its due diligence when it had no right to terminate the merger agreement based upon due diligence, and by raising issues as to Dynegy's intent to complete the merger with Enron and then backing out of a fully negotiated transaction, causing the ratings agencies to lower Enron credit ratings and a dramatic loss in business,"" according to the court filing. 
Bringing the suit are Bernard Shapiro, a New York state resident who owned 11,750 Enron common shares as of Nov. 28, and Peter Strub, a New Jersey resident who own 553.216 Enron common shares as of Nov. 28. 
Shapiro and Strub are suing on behalf of all those who owned Enron stock on Nov. 28, 2001. According to the court filing, the class may include ""several hundred thousand"" members. 
The two men are represented by Thomas E. Bilek, of the Houston law firm of Hoeffner & Bilek L.L.P. 
This is the second Enron shareholder lawsuit filed against Dynegy for canceling the merger.

BN Amro's Gaw Comments on the Impact of the Enron Collapse
2002-01-07 16:19 (New York)

     New York, Jan. 7 (Bloomberg) -- Peter D. Gaw, vice president
and managing director for energy at ABN Amro Holding NV's North
America unit, comments on the impact of Enron's bankruptcy on the
investment community and energy companies.
     Enron, once the largest energy trader, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, after disclosures about its
finances and bookkeeping shook investor confidence. Enron used
``off-balance sheet'' partnerships to shift debt from its books,
for example.
     Gaw was speaking at a conference sponsored by the New York
Society of Security Analysts and the Electric Power Supply
Association.

     ``December 2 was Pearl Harbor for the industry. But the
industry as a whole did a good job of unwinding its positions.
There were no serious problems.''

     On the reaction of the investment community to Enron's
collapse:
     ``We were asking the tough questions of Enron. We just
weren't demanding the answers. Now we are focusing on quality of
earnings, mark-to-market accounting and cash growth. We are
looking for a simplified financial structure, but that doesn't
mean everything on an off-balance sheet basis is bad. But the
financial community will be much more critical.''

     On the response of energy companies and their plans for new
power plants:
     ``Companies are trying to reduce debt, sell assets and make
their financial statements solid and clear, so I don't think we'll
see a lot of new projects in the first half of this year.''

Duke Energy was once considered the hopelessly asset-encumbered version of Enron. Nowadays that's not such a bad thing. 
A year ago Duke Energy was a wallflower in the frenetic dance of the energy traders. As Enron pursued its now infamous asset-light strategy, casting off power plants and pipelines to focus on wholesale trading, Duke remained wrapped in a protective mantle of $34 billion in hard assets. By September 2000 Enron was trading at 67 times earnings, while Duke's multiple was 20.
Suddenly Duke's assets no longer look like liabilities. Enron is bankrupt, and Dynegy and El Paso are struggling to maintain their bond ratings. But thanks to its more cautious strategy--bolstered by ownership of the Carolinas' largest electric utility and an interstate pipeline system--Duke has a shining A+ rating from Standard & Poor's, just one notch below that of J.P. Morgan Chase. 
That allows Duke to keep expanding as rivals pull back. While Enron was melting down in mid-November, Duke raised $750 million in a stock offering--to help pay for the $8.5 billion acquisition of Westcoast Energy, a Canadian pipeline operator. Westcoast, in turn, will give Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke a powerful trading position in California and the Pacific Northwest as gas takes on increasing importance as a fuel for electricity plants. 
Like most of Duke's assets, the new pipeline will serve primarily as a vehicle for wringing more profits out of Duke's $15-billion-a-year trading operation. A pipeline can provide a 7% return on invested capital, but the real money is in selling hedges and derivatives based on Duke's ability to deliver gas. ""You don't make money off an asset simply because you own it,"" says Richard Priory, Duke's chief executive. ""You trade around it."" 
Trading has been the fuel for Duke's fifteenfold revenue increase since 1995 to an estimated $70 billion in 2001. But don't expect Duke to fill the void created by Enron's collapse. Where Enron made a market in just about anything, from long-term gas supply contracts to memory chips, Priory demands that Duke's traders stick to the commodities Duke transports through its pipelines or generates in its power plants. That unadventurous strategy keeps a damper on earnings growth--Duke predicts earnings-per-share growth of a modest 10% to 15% over a base of $2.10 in 2000 going forward another two years--but ensures it will be around next Christmas. 
Duke's transformation from a geographically constrained Southern utility to trading giant came about during the first rumblings of deregulation. What's surprising is the resolutely conservative biography of the guy who made it happen. Priory, 55, grew up in a single-parent household in Lakehurst, N.J. His mother couldn't afford to pay college tuition, so he landed an engineering scholarship at West Virginia Institute of Technology, later receiving a master's degree from Princeton University. After a few years teaching engineering at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, he joined Duke Power in 1976 as a design engineer, rising steadily to president by 1994. 
By the time he took charge, Priory was convinced the traditional utility-business model no longer worked. He'd followed the generic playbook for utilities in the early 1990s, slashing employment and boosting efficiency (Duke Power's payroll fell from a high of 25,000 to 10,000). But there was only so much more cutting he could do. Then he'd be stuck in charge of a regional utility with single-digit earnings growth. A rate increase would take you only a little way out of this mire. He could gussy up the utility for sale, or he could pursue some of the outlandish strategies then coming into style, like buying developing-country power plants or investing in unrelated businesses. 
Instead Priory placed all his bets on a deceptively simple concept--convergence between the markets for gas and electricity. Duke wasn't the best place to be thinking such thoughts: The regulated utility still generates almost all its electricity with coal or nuclear fuel. But Priory knew that natural gas would become the fuel of choice for virtually all new generating plants. If he could combine his utility with a gas company, a new world of trading opportunities would open up. When the price of gas rose, he'd buy electricity and sell gas. If electricity prices rose, he'd buy gas and sell the juice. The key was owning the assets on all sides of the trade so he wasn't just speculating with shareholders' money. 
At the same time Priory was looking for a partner in the gas business, Paul Anderson, chief executive of Panenergy, a big Houston gas pipeline company once known as Panhandle Eastern, was looking for a utility. Anderson wasn't coy about his quest: He put a lightbulb on the cover of the 1995 annual report, not because Panenergy was in the electricity business, but because he wanted it to be. ""I talked to the CEO of just about every electric utility in the U.S."" recalls Anderson, now chief executive of Melbourne, Australia-based BHP Billiton Group. ""When I got to Priory, I basically found out he had the same view of the world as I did."" 
What made Priory stand out was his commitment to changing the way Duke did business, from a focus on finessing state regulators and running power plants and transmission lines to capitalizing on larger market forces that influenced the values of those assets. Anderson had already put Panenergy through that transformation by acquiring Associated Natural Gas, a Denver trading company, two years before. With Associated's 1,500 traders as shock troops, Anderson had changed Panenergy from an inward-focused pipeline operator into an accomplished trading house. The market had voted its approval by marking up Panenergy's stock fivefold over five years. Could some of that energizing be transferred to Duke with a merger? 
In August 1996 Priory, Anderson and their lieutenants met at a hotel in Memphis to hash out the details. Talking through the night, they arrived at a plan for Duke to take over Panenergy and bring its strategy of asset-based trading to the North Carolina utility. Anderson would be chief operating officer and other top Panenergy executives would still hold key jobs. 
There was grumbling from the utility side. ""Some people were saying, 'Hey, I thought this was a takeover,'"" Anderson recalls. But the merger went smoothly. It was understood from the start that Priory would remain in charge; so at the end of 1998 Anderson left to run BHP, then an Australian mining conglomerate. (Not surprisingly, he's since acquired a trading firm.) 
The basic strategy hashed out in that Memphis hotel hasn't changed. Duke views every asset, whether it's a pipeline or a 500-megawatt power plant, as holding both intrinsic and extrinsic value. The intrinsic value is the ability for the asset to make money. In the case of a power plant, that includes the location of the plant and the efficiency with which it transforms gas into electricity. Duke can't do much to change the inherent value of its assets, and it assumes competition will eliminate any edge it has anyway. 
The only way to make money, therefore, is to maximize the extrinsic value by trading around the assets (see chart). When it builds a power plant, for example, it sells some of the expected output in the forward market and buys the gas to fuel that output. As construction proceeds, the difference between the price of gas and the price of electricity widens and narrows, giving Duke the opportunity to sell more of the expected output if the price rises or sell output in future years to lock in profits on electricity it has yet to generate. Duke did this with a pair of ""peaker"" plants it built in Indiana and Ohio, locking in the first year's expected profits before construction was completed. 
If the traders sense a market is becoming too competitive, they may call for the outright sale of the plant. Duke did that in Hidalgo, Tex., where it sold a majority stake in a 500-megawatt plant for $235 million to Calpine in 2000, three months before it was completed, and mothballed five other projects in the face of rampant overbuilding. 
Duke is keeping the undeveloped sites--long-call options, as it were--on the possibility that electricity will become profitable again in Texas. In the meantime it's building 11 more plants around the country, as part of a diversification strategy designed to weather what could be severe downturns in the electricity market in certain regions such as Texas and the Midwest. 
Prices--whether of generating capacity or of energy--fluctuate. The traders with staying power are in the best position to capitalize on these fluctuations. That's why Goldman Sachs can make more money trading bonds than you can. And that's why Duke can make more money than Calpine.

ONGC spurns BG operatorship offer once again

Copyright (c) Business Standard

The Oil and Gas Corporation (ONGC) has rejected yet another offer of the UK-based oil and gas major BG Group Plc, to become an operator in the three offshore oil and gas fields - Tapti, Mukta and Panna - on the western coast of India. 
Subir Raha, chairman and managing director of ONGC told newspersons here that BG had offered a cash settlement on December 20 asking us to respond by December 21. ""We have rejected the offer as it was not sufficiently responsive"".
This is a second offer made by the BG group. It withdrew its earlier offer of giving 10 per cent stake in an exploratory gas block in Brazil provided it relinquishes its claim as operator of these three discovered oil and gas fields. 
BG Group entered into an agreement with the beleaguered US energy major Enron Corporation to acquire 30 per cent equity in these three fields for $ 388 million. 
The offer is conditional on being granted operatorship of these fields. 
""BG went and made a deal with Enron. BG came and asked us to give them operatorship saying they could improve the running of the fields. We asked them why do you think we can't do the same?"" Raha said. 
Elaborating on the cash settlement, another ONGC official said that BG offered to withdraw a case of arbitration where Enron billed $4.5 million as additional expenses incurred on these fields. BG offered to withdraw the case and offered $11.5 million cash in lieu of the foregoing operatorship ONGC claims on these three fields. ONGC owns 40 per cent and Reliance Industries, the remaining 30 per cent in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti fields.

From:		Mark Taylor					Date:	May 11, 2001
		Vice President and General Counsel

Subject:	Enron North America Corp. NYMEX Hedge Exemption Applications
													

We are in the process of preparing applications for position limit exemptions for ENA's NYMEX energy commodities futures trading.  These applications require that ENA represent whether its officers, employees, owners, or agents have a power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any related commodity future(s) account either individually or acting with another person pursuant to express or implied agreement.

Please direct any responses to my paralegal, Tana Jones, via intercompany email or call her at (713) 853-3399 by the end of business on June 15, 2001 if you have any power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any commodity futures account (other than an ENA or other trading affiliate account).

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A COMMODITY FUTURES ACCOUNT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS REQUEST.

It seems like we would have approximately the same cost for air at Klein

USA: Enron disclosed insider data to some investors-NYT.

NEW YORK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. executives enticed wealthy investors in one of the partnerships that helped wreck the company with the prospect that inside knowledge could help double their money in months, the online edition of the New York Times reported on Friday. 
Confidential records of an Enron partnership called LJM2 show company executives offering potential investors inside knowledge about Enron and its off-the-books holdings, information that they denied company shareholders, the Times said.
Neither Enron nor Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. , which underwrote the LJM2 offering, were immediately available to comment on the story. 
Dozens of banks, brokerage firms, pension funds and institutional investors were approached to invest in LJM2 just over two years ago, and all were provided with the confidential data about the extent of Enron's off-balance-sheet dealings, but could not share the information with their brokerage clients, according to the Times. 
The LJM2 partnership was set up, in part, to invest in entities that Enron controlled and to purchase investments that Enron did not want on its books, the Times said. 
""Enron frequently has access to investment opportunities that are not available to other investors,"" the Times quotes the private placement memorandum for LJM2.

Enron may get new boss 
Candidate talking with directors, creditors 
By DAVID IVANOVICH 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 25, 2002, 1:43AM
WASHINGTON -- A candidate tapped by Enron's board of directors and largest creditors to assume the company's helm will meet with Enron managers as early as today. 
Moving quickly to fill the void left after the departure of Chairman Ken Lay, the board and creditors committee were known to be talking with Stephen Cooper, managing principal at Zolfo Cooper, a New York-based corporate-recovery and crisis-management firm. 
Cooper served as chief restructuring officer at Ontario-based Laidlaw Inc., the largest ground transportation company in North America and owner of Greyhound Lines. 
Previously, Cooper was a partner in the accounting firm Touche Ross & Co. 
Cooper could not be reached for immediate comment Thursday night. And Martin Bienenstock, an attorney with Weil, Gotshal & Manges representing Enron in its bankruptcy case, declined to say whether Cooper is indeed the front-runner for the job. 
Whether he actually gets the job will depend on how the meetings with Enron's remaining executives go today, Bienenstock said. 
Corporate turnaround experts say Enron will need an executive with enough credibility to stem the scandals swirling around the company and stave off an effort to persuade U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur Gonzalez to order the appointment of a trustee to run the company. 
""A Rudy Guiliani, that's what's called for, somebody of that stature,"" said one corporate restructuring expert who asked not to be named. ""Or a George Mitchell."" 
Guiliani, the former mayor of New York, drew high marks for his leadership in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Mitchell, a former senator from Maine, helped negotiate a peace accord in Northern Ireland. 
While not identifying the individual, Bienenstock called the board and creditor committee's candidate ""a very, very solid citizen."" 
Cooper is not well-known in Houston's energy sector. 
""Understanding Greyhound is a lot different from understanding Enron,"" said one energy industry observer. ""The energy industry is many times more complex, and the Enron version of that is even more complex."" 
Carol Coale, a Houston-based natural gas analyst at Prudential Securities, doesn't think the search for a new boss at Enron should range outside the energy industry. 
""The energy industry is diverse enough where you could find the right person that has knowledge of energy,"" Coale said. ""I don't see what the advantages are of going outside."" 
John Olson, an energy analyst with Sanders Morris Harris in Houston, was not surprised Enron's board and creditors were shopping outside the sector. 
""What you need is somebody who has been totally removed,"" Olson said. The company's new turnaround expert needs to be a ""debt management guy who can restructure the debt and who also knows all about the derivatives books, which clearly requires some expertise in voodoo."" 
Lay, whose name for years has been synonymous with the staid natural gas pipeline company he transformed into an energy and trading powerhouse, stepped down late Wednesday at the creditors' urging. 
""I want to see Enron survive, and for that to happen we need someone at the helm who can focus 100 percent of his efforts on reorganizing the company,"" Lay said. ""Unfortunately, with the multiple inquiries and investigations that currently require much of my time, it is becoming increasingly difficult to concentrate fully on what is most important to Enron stakeholders."" 
The creditors' committee, in a prepared statement, said it was pleased by Lay's exit. ""This is a step in the right direction, to maximize value for all creditors,"" it said. ""The committee is also encouraged that Enron is proceeding with the retention of a chief restructuring officer."" 
By naming a chief restructuring officer, Enron's board and creditors clearly are hoping to head off the appointment of a trustee. 
Trustees traditionally are known for breaking up rather than resuscitating debt-laden companies. A trustee also would call all the shots at the company, superseding the role of the board and the company management. 
A group of Enron creditors, led by Dallas-based Wiser Oil Co., are pushing for just such an appointment. 
To persuade a bankruptcy court to name a trustee, Wiser and its allies would have to find enough evidence to demonstrate fraud, mismanagement or incompetence. 


Enron's new CEO could could be savior or victim
By KRISTEN HAYS
Associated Press Writer

HOUSTON (AP) - Kenneth Lay's successor as Enron Corp.'s chief executive could be the hero who saves the bankrupt energy giant or a well-intentioned outsider blindsided by yet-unseen punches. 
""In a sense, it provides a big showcase for your talents,"" said Henry T.C. Hu, a corporate law professor at the University of Texas. ""Presumably you could think the bulk of the bad has come out. But one is not entirely sure.""
But anyone willing to take the chance - or seize the opportunity - likely has a thick skin, he said. 
'Any time you're dealing with bankruptcy proceedings and distress situations, you've already developed a lot of callouses,"" Hu said. ""You don't feel it anymore."" 
Lay resigned as chairman and chief executive Wednesday, saying the multitude of lawsuits and investigations into Enron's spectacular collapse in an accounting scandal is preventing him from properly running the company. 
Enron said it will search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim chief executive and help the company survive the biggest bankruptcy in history. 
""They're going to need someone with a specialization in these situations that can devote 100 percent of his time to business matters of the company,"" said Mike Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland. ""It's impossible to deal with Congress and the Justice Department and try to resuscitate a company at the same time."" 
Lay, 59, will remain on Enron's board. Enron spokesman Vance Meyer said he will not receive a severance package. 
Lay was chairman and CEO for almost all of the 16 years since the company was created from a 1985 merger of two natural gas pipeline companies. In that time Enron grew from a mildly profitable business into the world's largest energy marketer. It diversified its trading to include pulp, paper and bandwidth, among other commodities. 
Enron reached No. 7 on the Fortune 500 and earned hundreds millions in reported profits while concocting financial partnerships that allowed the company to keep half a billion dollars in debt off its books. 
Last year, the accounting practice was exposed, and Enron's stock slid to less than a dollar from about $80. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and thousands of Enron employees lost their jobs, as well as much of their life savings, since their 401(k) accounts were loaded with company stock. 
Congress, the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and others are investigating. Lay and the company face numerous lawsuits and increasing criticism from employees, shareholders and politicians demanding answers as to how Enron could implode so savagely. 
William Brandt Jr., president and chief executive of Development Specialists, a Chicago-based firm that helps distressed businesses rebound, said Enron's next CEO could be a trustee appointed by the judge overseeing the bankruptcy in New York. 
A trustee would answer to the judge rather than Enron's board or its creditors, Brandt said. A showing of fraud, mismanagement or incompetence of previous management traditionally supports the appointment of a trustee. 
Hu said that if Enron ends up appointing a CEO, it must be someone who inspires confidence without expecting the typical perks of top executives, such as stock options. 
The lure would be the reputation boost that would come from saving a company from such a huge, controversial downfall, he said. 
""There's a lot more laughter and mirth when you're an obstetrician rather than when you're a coroner,"" Hu said. ""And here, you're a coroner. It's an enormously difficult task. And everybody's looking over your shoulder.""

Lay's exit prompts mixed reactions 
Amid praise for ex-CEO, many say his departure is overdue 
By MARY VUONG 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 25, 2002, 12:03AM
Overdue. Appropriate. Best for the company. 
Those were the thoughts of some former Enron employees on Ken Lay's resignation as chairman and chief executive officer of Enron. 
Respected. Upstanding. Personable. 
Those were the words they used to describe the man, as they waited Thursday for relief from a fund set up for former employees. 
""Everybody saw him as sort of a grandfatherly figure,"" said Steve Crumley, a former manager with the broadband unit. A man you looked up to and trusted, Lay ""had a good head on his shoulders,"" added Crumley, 43, of The Woodlands. 
""Very caring, very giving, very personable -- maybe just like the guy next door,"" said Nathan Childs, 36, of Kempner, who was a technician for the information technology hardware department. 
""All of us thought very highly of Ken Lay,"" said Helena G. Payne, a senior accounting clerk before retiring last March after 24 years. She lost her 401(k) funds following Enron's collapse. 
Payne, 61, said she occasionally met Lay when he strolled through departments or at special breakfasts on the 50th floor in which about a dozen employees discussed grievances with him. 
""He had an open-door-type atmosphere,"" and made sure his managers and directors did the same, she said. 
Juantongia Calvin, who worked in global management, held Lay in the ""highest regards"" before Enron's collapse. She still does, she said. 
He took care of employees, and his community activism pushed her to get involved as well, said Calvin, 30, of Houston. ""He was one of the most respected persons I had ever met or worked for."" 
Lay was not a mysterious figure nor did he ride in his own private elevator, recalled former accounting specialist Sue Nix, yet he was hardly someone you bumped into in the cafeteria. 
Nix, 57, a Huffman resident, said she encountered Lay on the elevator regularly. ""He would talk to you just as if you were as important as anybody else."" 
In one elevator ride, Nix said, Lay showed her two grandsons -- who had accompanied her to work -- how to piece together a puzzle. 
""It proved he was human,"" she said. ""I always was very proud when (people) spoke of Ken Lay."" 
Nix said her view of Lay ""hasn't really changed. So much blame has been put on his shoulders."" 
Several of those interviewed said their perceptions of Lay have shifted, albeit not very dramatically. He is to blame for some of Enron's failure, although how much is not yet clear to them, they said. 
They believe other executives and senior managers are responsible, too, such as former CEO Jeffrey Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andy Fastow. 
""I feel like maybe (Lay) was influenced by the wrong type of people,"" Payne said. 
""I thought (Lay) was a really wonderful man,"" said Kimberly Niekamp, a former accounting specialist. ""I thought it was all (Skilling's fault)."" 
Now, Niekamp, 38, of Humble said, she doesn't know what to say or think of Lay. ""A terrible person,"" she offered in a questioning tone. 
There is a sense that maybe he was greedy, disconnected and too focused on the political process, said Crumley, adding, ""He should've focused more on the realities of running the business."" 
Calvin said Lay could have prevented Enron's failure, but that others could have as well. 
""I blame the people responsible for taking the millions,"" Childs said. 
Whether Enron can return to its previous glory is questionable or unlikely, some said. 
""I'm not sure that it (Lay's resignation) is going to help Enron get back on its feet,"" Crumley said, but restoring the company ""would be tough with him at the helm."" 
Payne said it was necessary Lay resign to handle all the lawsuits and it was best for the company to move forward. 
""I don't look for Enron to come back as Enron,"" Nix said.

Ex-staffers say Enron division inflated profits
Alex Berenson, New York Times News Service

North Sports Final ; N

(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)

A division of Enron Corp. overstated its profits by hundreds of millions of dollars over the past three years, and senior Enron executives were warned almost a year ago that the division's profits were illusory, according to several former employees. 
The division, Enron Energy Services, created in 1997, competed with utilities to sell electricity and natural gas to commercial and industrial customers. It was run by Lou Pai, who sold $353 million in Enron stock in the past three years, more than any other Enron executive, and Thomas White, who left Enron to become secretary of the Army last June.
Energy Services accounted for a small part of Enron's revenues but was promoted by the company as a big growth opportunity. 
But former employees suggest that Energy Services used shoddy accounting practices to create ""illusory earnings,"" in the words of Jeff Gray, who joined Enron in 2000 and worked at the division for most of 2001. 
For example, by estimating that the price of electricity would fall in the future, Enron could book an immediate profit on a contract. By contrast, companies using traditional accounting book profits only as they deliver the services. 
A spokesman for White did not return calls for comment. Pai and a spokesman for Enron also did not return calls. 
Peggy Mahoney, a spokeswoman for Energy Services, said the division's financial results had accurately reflected its business. ""It was no pie in the sky,"" she said. 
As a result of its practice of projecting profits, Energy Services salespeople and senior managers pressured the managers who made the key assumptions about deregulation and energy prices, said Glenn Dickson, a manager at Energy Services who was dismissed in December. 
""The whole culture was much more sales driven than anything else,"" Dickson said. ""The people that were having to sign off on the deals with a gun to their head knew that it wasn't a good deal."" 
Dickson and other former employees said senior executives at Energy Services knew that their assumptions were unreliable. 
At the same time, expenses ballooned as Energy Services found that the costs of managing its contracts were higher than it had projected. 
""They knew how to get a product out there, but they didn't know how to run a business,"" said Tony Dorazio, a former product development manager at Energy Services. 
None of the ex-employees said they knew whether Pai or White was aware of any accounting lapses at Energy Services.

Jesse Jackson To Hold Enron Rally Today

KPRC, Channel 2, Houston
HOUSTON -- The Enron Corp.'s ex-workers will take center stage Friday as the Rev. Jesse Jackson holds a rally in their honor. 
The rally will be held at noon Friday at the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church, which is across the street from Enron's headquarters in downtown. 
Jackson said that Houston-area ministers and members of his Rainbow Coalition will unite in prayer as a sign of support to help rally for financial assistance for the Enron employees left jobless and with shriveled 401(k) accounts, which were mostly invested in the now bankrupt company. 
""(The laid-off workers) hands were tied behind their backs as their life's savings went down the river,"" Jackson said. 
Jackson tried to meet with former Enron Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Lay Thursday night, but was turned away. 
Lay's secretary said that he didn't have time to meet with Jackson. 
But Lay told Jackson that he had a family emergency. 
""It's not personal,"" Jackson said. 
Before the rally, Jackson met with business and community leaders to see what more could be done for the fired workers.

On Dec. 21, 1999, in Enron's chest-puffing days, the company churned out a press release to tout its status as one of Fortune magazine's ""100 best companies to work for in America."" 
""Our corporate culture and our world-class employees make Enron a great place to work,"" said Kenneth Lay, the company's chairman and chief executive officer. ""We are proud to receive recognition as a top workplace; it's a reflection of our commitment to our employees and their key role in our company's success.""
Now Lay has resigned, and Enron Corp.'s commitment to employees, especially its retirement savings plans, is under high-profile congressional scrutiny. And the story of how many Enron workers watched their 401(k) plans, the savings programs designed to ensure a comfortable retirement, become nearly worthless is sparking a broader debate on the potent political issue of retirement security. 
Some lawmakers and pension specialists are wondering if the Enron case will be for the 401(k) plan what the Studebaker case of nearly 40 years ago was to more traditional company pension plans. In the Studebaker case, workers were shocked to find their pension benefits were not guaranteed when the company terminated the plan in 1963. 
That case prompted Congress to eventually pass the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, establishing among other things a government guarantee of defined-benefit pension plans. But those protections do not apply to 401(k) plans, which have dramatically overtaken traditional pensions in number in the last 15 years. 
""I've watched this go from a backwater technical issue no one paid attention to, to now being one of the core issues people think of,"" said Rep. Earl Pomeroy (D-N.D.), a leading pension authority in Congress. ""As a result, the politics behind it have grown hotly charged as well. 
""This is a mixed blessing. The good news is Congress is now interested,"" Pomeroy said. ""The bad news is Congress is now interested. This is an area where ill-advised, well-intentioned legislation can do some serious damage."" 
Even before the hearings started, several legislative proposals have been introduced. One, by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), would limit employee contributions in company stock to 20 percent of the total and employees could convert any matching company stock to another financial instrument within 90 days. To reduce the appeal of granting a match in stock, the legislation also would cut tax breaks for matching company stock in half. 
Another proposal, offered by Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), calls for a federal tax penalty on sales of stock by company insiders if other lower-ranking employees are restricted. 
The federal government can only loosely regulate most employee benefits because companies provide them on a voluntary basis. And, as workers often come to find, companies almost universally reserve the right to change, amend or terminate any or all of those benefits. 
Buffet of benefits 
Businesses are far more likely, however, to emphasize benefits as an inducement to sign on and stay with a company. Enron's employee handbook, for instance, lays out a rich buffet of benefits in addition to the 401(k) plan: a stock options plan that awarded up to 25 percent of salary in Enron stock options; subsidized membership at The Body Shop fitness center, complete with tai chi and Pilates classes; and an on-site doctor's office. 
Like many companies, Enron also offered a 401(k) savings plan, listing its stock as the first option of many investment funds available. The company matched each $1 an employee contributed with 50 cents worth of Enron stock. 
Those who chose the Enron option were rewarded famously as the stock value soared. But as Enron's stock plummeted, they learned the crushing reality of the risk inherent in 401(k) plans. The plaintive stories of families whose retirement savings were wiped out will no doubt be told during the hearings. 
Congress is likely to respond in some fashion, and Pomeroy and others are concerned that lawmakers could actually set back the cause of retirement security. For instance, if Congress were to regulate 401(k) plans too heavily, companies might choose to not offer them, putting workers' retirement finances in even greater peril. 
Companies also could choose to provide no match. Indeed, as salaried workers at Ford Motor Co. found recently, that company match is voluntary and Ford suspended its contribution to 401(k) plans for 2002. What's more, the government can guarantee a pension plan because it is not based on an employee making an investment decision. Similar protection for a 401(k) plan would be tantamount to the government guaranteeing an ever-rising rate of return. 
Defined-benefit plans, promising a certain amount of money for life upon retirement, are far more easily regulated than 401(k) plans, whose results depend on market forces and individual choices. In the last 10 years, most 401(k) plans clearly increased in value that would have far exceeded defined-benefit plans. 
Shifting of risk 
But it is also true that most companies, desirous of having employees control large blocks of stock, encourage investment in company stock. When that stock goes down in value, the risk of the investment becomes harshly clear. 
The number of American workers covered by some form of pension plan has remained nearly constant for 25 years, at about 50 percent of the private sector labor force. But over that time, the number covered by 401(k), or defined-contribution, plans has far exceeded those covered by the more traditional defined-benefit plans. With that move has also come a shifting of risk, from the employer to the employee. 
""The shift from the defined-benefit plan to the defined- contribution plan has left employees with a great deal more exposure than they had under traditional pension plans,"" Pomeroy said. ""And, to my knowledge, Congress has never had a hearing on this great shift."" 
That may well be about to change. And there are those who are pushing for Congress to take a more aggressive stance. For one, Karen Friedman, director of policy strategies of the Pension Rights Center in Washington, said Congress should ""enact protections to see that Enron doesn't happen again."" 
""One big question that this raises is: Are we, in this society, overreliant on the 401(k) plan and other non-insured savings plans?"" Friedman said. ""We think this is the perfect time to have that debate. We've been warning of the perils of 401(k) plans for years and years. Maybe 401s were great in a bull market. The question is, are they the right plan in today's market?"" 
For now, how that question will be answered falls to Congress. 
""You know Congress is going to be looking for one,"" Pomeroy said, ""or if not one, a darned good press release.""

Enron: The Fallout
The history of a head-spinning conglomerate: Wall Street darling: Enron trader was an unregulated commodities exchange

WASHINGTON - Enron may have got its start in the lunch-bucket industry of natural gas pipelines, but in its glory days as the seventh-largest company in the United States it claimed it had rewritten the laws of economics by using the power of the Internet. 
But like the high-flying dot.coms it emulated, the company came crashing down to earth, felled by a suspect business model and crooked accounting on an eye-popping scale.
While employees in Houston lament their vanished retirement savings and Washington goes into scandal mode, law enforcement officials, politicians and financial regulators are trying to piece together what went wrong and why. 
It all began so simply. 
In 1986, Kenneth Lay was appointed chief executive officer of Houston-based Enron, the result of a merger between two steady but unspectacular pipeline companies, Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. 
The business was uncomplicated and profitable at the start: It would sell a specific supply of natural gas to a utility or business on a certain day. 
Dissatisfied with remaining an energy small fry in the capital of big oil Texas, Mr. Lay dreamed big. 
The only way his company could grow was to speed along energy deregulation then being contemplated by Washington. Enron quickly got into the lobbying game, pressing the case for less government control of the energy business. 
It and other energy companies got their way in 1992, when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, headed by Wendy Gramm, the wife of the powerful Texas Senator Phil Gramm, exempted Enron and other power marketers from its oversight. 
She was rewarded with a place on the company's board of directors and Enron got into the complicated business of being an energy broker. 
Instead of simply selling natural gas it was carrying in its own pipelines, it began to use its trading and negotiating skills to sell electricity. 
Quickly, Enron diversified and began trading anything that could be made into a commodity, a head-spinning conglomeration of businesses that included everything from high-speed Internet capacity to interest rates fluctuations to weather changes. 
The company took its cut from both the buyer and the seller, essentially acting as an unregulated commodities exchange. 
Meanwhile, it bought up utilities around the world, such as Britain's Wessex Water, for which it paid US$2.2-billion, a power plant in India and another in Oregon. It also dabbled in unrelated areas, like a plan to build a high-speed broadband telecommunications network and signing a 20-year deal with Blockbuster Video to sell video on demand. 
Wall Street quickly took notice. In 1997, Enron shares were trading for less than $20. In August, 2000, they reached their all-time high of $84. 
Everyone jumped aboard the bandwagon. Financial journalists extolled Enron as the new exemplar, stockholders got rich, as did the company's growing corps of workers, many of whom ploughed their pension savings into Enron shares. 
Politicians also got their cut. Enron became one of the United States' largest political donors, lavishing $1.7-million during the 2000 elections alone (75% of that went to Republicans). 
Enron is the biggest lifetime contributor to George W. Bush, spending almost $600,000 on the U.S. President and former Texas governor. Mr. Lay made it into the inner circles of power -- to the point of being called ""Kenny-boy"" by the nickname-loving commander-in-chief and becoming the only energy executive allowed to meet Dick Cheney, the U.S. Vice-President, when he was crafting the administration's energy policy last year. 
A big billboard in Enron's gleaming 50-storey headquarters in downtown Houston displayed the ever-climbing share price. 
The company splashed around its money, spending $100-million on the must-have for dot.coms, an eponymous sports stadium. 
When many high-tech companies flamed out, Enron continued to soar -- investors were reassured by the tangible assets like pipelines and power plants backing its earnings rise. 
The only problem was it wasn't making nearly enough money to justify its valuation and was being swamped by debt. 
Seeking to stave off a share price collapse, its executives began creating shell partnerships, many of them named after Star Wars and Jurassic Park characters, to keep the debt off its books. 
One such partnership, Chewco, fronted by chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, took more than $600-million in debt. The privileged secret investors who were allowed to take part in the partnerships were promised any losses would be made up in cash or Enron stock. 
Those kinds of fudges made Enron appear highly profitable. 
Arthur Andersen, the accountants who were supposed to make sure Enron's records followed the law, became increasingly uncomfortable. Last February, the accounting firm even considered dropping Enron as a client. 
But any squeamishness was overcome by the more than $50-million it was making from its accounting and consulting work for the company. 
The departure in August of Jeff Skilling, Enron's president and chief executive officer, for personal reasons signalled that something was very wrong. 
Sherron Watkins, an Enron vice-president, wrote a one-page memo to Mr. Lay that month, warning him the company could ""implode in a wave of accounting scandals."" 
On Oct. 16, Enron announced a $618-million loss for the third quarter and disclosed a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholders' equity because of the partnerships run by Mr. Fastow. 
The share price began to plunge but Enron prevented its employees from cashing out their shares because of a change in pension system administrators. 
An increasingly desperate Mr. Lay tried calling in his political chits, ringing up Cabinet officials, and even Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. No one came to his aid, fearing they would be tarred in a money-for-influence scandal. 
On Nov. 8, Enron announced it had overstated its earnings by $586-million over the last five years and had $3-billion in obligations to various partnerships. 
The news made rival Dynergy drop a $23-billion merger offer. Enron declared bankruptcy on Dec. 2. 
As federal authorities began to look into the collapse, Arthur Andersen accountants in Houston began to shred thousands of documents. 
Now Washington's scandal machinery has creaked into action, with 11 congressional committees investigating the collapse, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents are in Houston guarding Enron files and some congressional Democrats are calling for an independent investigator to look into links between the Bush administration and Enron. 
And all that money that Kenny-boy lavished on the White House? His reward was a frosty mention from Mr. Bush calling him ""Mr. Lay,"" then lamenting the $8,000 his mother-in-law lost by holding Enron shares.

Following The Paper Trail In The Enron-Andersen Scandal
By Bryan Lee

01/25/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The following is a chronology of events uncovered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee's investigation of the financial collapse of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) and the role of its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP.
The paper-trail timeline was revealed in various documents released to the public by the committee in recent weeks: 

Feb. 5, 2001 - Andersen's auditing team meets to discuss whether or not to retain Enron's business due to concerns about the propriety of the off-the-balance-sheet transactions. 
The auditors weigh their concerns about ""conflicts of interest"" regarding former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's involvement in overseeing the partnerships involved in the transactions versus forgoing the more than $100 million in fees Andersen expected to earn from its Enron business in 2001. 
According to an e-mail to David Duncan, Andersen's lead auditor for the Enron account, the ""significant discussions"" also address concerns about ""intelligent gambling"" related to Enron's mark-to-market earnings, but the group ultimately concludes the risks of maintaining Enron's business can be managed. 
The account also noted that Andersen had communications with Enron's board about the directors' views of the transactions. The committee is seeking further details about those communications. 

August 2001 - After the surprise announcement that Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling was resigning for personal reasons, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay receives an anonymous memorandum warning the company could ""implode in a wave of accounting scandals"" due to increasing scrutiny from investors skeptical about the true reason for Skilling's resignation. 
According to the memo, several Enron officials raised similar concerns directly with Skilling. 
Aug. 20, the author of the memo, Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, telephones an Andersen auditor and relays her concerns. 
Watkins subsequently meets with Lay to discuss her concerns. At some point Lay directs Enron's law firm, Vinson & Elkins, to investigate the allegations raised by Watkins. In her memo, Watkins specifically advises that a firm other than Vinson & Elkins be used because it provided ""true sale opinions"" on some of the questionable transactions. 

September 2001 - Andersen ""consultation group"" formed in response to growing alarm about Enron's plight and the auditing firm's admitted $1 billion accounting error uncovered in August that will require a significant writedown by Enron. 
During these conference calls in September or early October, Duncan, the lead auditor, tells committee investigators that Andersen attorney Nancy Temple asks: ""How are you on compliance with the document-retention policy on Enron?"" 
Duncan tells the committee staff his response was, ""At best, irregular."" 

October 2001 - Andersen's concerns mushroom about how Enron will report its third-quarter results, and whether the report will pass muster legally and reflect generally accepted accounting practices. 
Oct. 9, Andersen hires an outside law firm to advise the firm amid its growing concern about the Enron account, indicating Andersen was becoming concerned about its legal liability. 
Oct. 12, Temple sends an e-mail to an Andersen executive, who forwarded it to Duncan, in which the Andersen attorney says: ""It might be useful to consider reminding the (Enron) engagement team of our documentation and retention policy. It will be helpful to make sure we have complied with the policy."" 
The policy addresses ""organization, retention and destruction"" of client information. 
Also Oct. 12, Duncan receives a draft press release from Enron in which the company plans to describe its $1 billion charge against income as a nonrecurring item. 
Three days later, Duncan sends a memo to ""the files"" outlining his Oct. 14 discussion with Enron Chief Accounting Officer Rick Causey. Duncan voiced ""strong concerns"" that describing the charge as nonrecurring ""could be misconstrued or misunderstood by investors."" 
Duncan also noted that he informed Causey that Andersen was aware of enforcement actions undertaken by the Securities and Exchange Commission ""in cases where they believe such a presentation was materially misleading."" 
Oct. 15, Enron issued a press release describing the charge as nonrecurring. 
Oct. 16, Temple sends an e-mail to Duncan advising him to delete her name from the memo about Andersen's concerns about Enron's handling of the third-quarter press release. ""Reference to the legal group consultation arguably is a waiver of attorney-client privileged advice and if my name is mentioned it increases the chances that I might be a witness, which I prefer to avoid."" 
Around Oct. 19-20, Duncan learns the SEC has launched a formal inquiry of Enron's financial records and reporting. He informs the Andersen consultation group, which includes Temple. Oct. 22, Duncan and the Andersen auditing team meet with Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, to discuss the SEC probe. 
Oct. 23, Duncan convenes an ""urgent meeting"" of the Enron auditing team, at which he organizes a concerted effort to destroy a ""significant"" number of documents of interest to SEC and congressional investigators, Andersen executives testify. 
Oct. 24, Enron fires Fastow, its chief financial officer. 
Oct. 25, Enron issues a notice advising that preservation of documents is required by law, given that the company was being sued by investors. 
The Duncan-led document destruction would continue through the first 10 days of November. 

Nov. 8 - Enron reveals questionable partnership transactions helped it overstate its earnings since 1997 by nearly $600 million. 
Temple, the Andersen attorney, issues a memorandum dated Nov. 10 ordering the preservation of documents related to the Enron account. The memo is sent after Andersen receives a subpoena from the SEC. 
Duncan later tells committee investigators that he complied with Temple's instructions in a Nov. 9 voice mail and stopped document destruction, which Duncan said he had undertaken in compliance with the firm's policy on retention and destruction of documents. 
Enron's stock has been steadily plunging, and enters free fall after Dynegy Inc. (DYN) announces it will abandon a proposed merger-rescue transaction. 

Dec. 2 - Enron files the largest corporate bankruptcy proceeding in U.S. history. Its stock is worth cents a share. A year earlier, the company's stock peaked at nearly $90 a share. 
Later in the month, two congressional committees hold hearings on the Enron debacle. Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino testifies before the House Financial Services Committee that the company made mistakes but acted in good faith. 
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Fritz Hollings, D-S.C., calls for legislation to bar the use of special-purpose entities, such as the partnership transactions Enron used to take its debt off its books and overstate its earnings. 
The House Energy and Commerce Committee announces it will formally investigate Enron's financial collapse. Documents gathered and interviews conducted provided since then form the basis of this timeline. 

January - After more than a half dozen congressional committees have taken up the Enron matter, Andersen announces its employees destroyed a ""significant"" amount of paper and electronic records related to the Enron account. 
Jan. 15, the company fires Duncan, who soon after meets with House Energy and Commerce Committee investigators. 
Jan. 22, Enron announces Lay has resigned. The announcement comes after the Justice Department and the FBI begin a probe on reports Enron employees had engaged in document destruction. Lay is scheduled to testify Feb. 4 before two congressional panels, the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee. 
The House Energy and Commerce committee subpoenas Duncan to testify at a hearing Jan. 23. Duncan invokes his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Andersen officials lay full culpability for the document destruction at Duncan's feet and disavow knowledge of his actions at the time.

-The first hard look by Congress at what's behind the Enron Corp. collapse left lawmakers Thursday certain of only one thing: Thousands of documents were destroyed by the energy company's blue-ribbon accounting firm. 
-A federal judge barred Arthur Andersen LLP from shredding any more documents related to Enron Corp. audits and ruled employees who admitted to destroying documents must give depositions as soon as next month.
-Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., whose Senate Governmental Affairs Committee also began hearings into Enron on Thursday, said the panel would issue subpoenas for Enron and Andersen's documents related to contacts with the White House or federal agencies and departments. 
-Lawmakers in both the House and Senate said they were rethinking the need to consider legislation that would bar accounting firms from having lucrative consulting contracts with companies whose books they also audit. 
-The Enron case already has produced several book deals, with publishers hoping to replicate the success of ""Barbarians at the Gate,"" the best seller about the fall of RJR Nabisco. 
-A Houston Boys and Girls Clubs center that was funded in part by bankrupt Enron Corp. will remain open after a businessman agreed to donate $1 million for its operation.

First Day of Document Shredding Probe Gives Few Answers

Turning now to the latest on the Enron collapse, a House panel has launched hearings into document shredding, one of several Enron related probes. 
CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: Turning now to the latest on the Enron collapse, a House panel has launched hearings into document shredding, one of several Enron related probes.
CNN Congressional Correspondent Kate Snow reports initial testimony was marked by dramatic exchanges and silence. 
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) 
KATE SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The panel's first witness, the man who seemed likely to have the most information, David Duncan, was Andersen's top partner on the Enron account in Houston. 
REP. JIM GREENWOOD (R), PENNSYLVANIA: Did you give an order to destroy documents in an attempt to subvert governmental investigations into Enron's financial collapse? 
DAVID DUNCAN, FORMER ANDERSEN AUDITOR: On the advice of my counsel, I respectfully decline to answer the question based on the protection afforded me under the Constitution of the United States. 
SNOW: Duncan refused to testify, leaving current Andersen officials to do all the talking. They pinned the blame on Duncan, saying he had called a meeting last October and told others to use the shredder. 
C.E. ANDREWS, ANDERSEN PARTNER: I agree that the action that took place on October 23rd and the subsequent elimination of e-mails and destruction of documents is an action that is totally inappropriate. 
SNOW: Lawmakers wondered about the finger pointing. 
REPRESENTATIVE CLIFF STEARNS (R) FLORIDA: Is Mr. Duncan being made a scapegoat here? 
SNOW: But he wasn't the only one under fire. Attorney Nancy Temple wrote an October 12 e-mail about the company's policy on retaining documents. Duncan has told investigators he was following her advice. Temple was grilled on why she wrote that memo. Did she know Enron was being investigated? Did she know a whistle-blower had raised questions about the company's practices? 
NANCY TEMPLE, ENRON ATTORNEY: To my recollection, I don't... UNIDENTIFIED REPRESENTATIVE: Just yes or no. 
TEMPLE: ... recall seeing a letter from Ms. Watkins. 
UNIDENTIFIED REPRESENTATIVE: Is that a no? So you're saying no, you did not know about Sharon Watkins' letter on October 23rd? You knew nothing about it? Is that your answer, that, no? 
TEMPLE: I was aware that she had made allegations. 
SNOW (on camera): After the hearing, investigators released another memo they said showed Andersen employees were encouraged to work overtime to destroy documents. Committee leaders believe up to 80 Andersen employees got the word to start shredding. 
Kate Snow, CNN, Capitol Hill. 
(END VIDEOTAPE) 
COSTELLO: Did you watch any of the Congressional hearings yesterday afternoon? 
CHAD MYERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I did. 
COSTELLO: It was brutal, wasn't it? 
MYERS: It was. I mean those guys really have their work cut out for them. And I hope someone really comes down and says this is really what happened and -- you can't say you're sorry because, right? But -- and this is why and we really get to the truth. Because those investors and those people that worked there really need to know the truth. 
COSTELLO: Well, with some people not talking or refusing to talk, maybe we'll never get the answers. 
MYERS: I'm afraid not. 
COSTELLO: But at least they're making fools of them in public. 
MYERS: Oh, well... 
COSTELLO: I mean did you hear the questions? They were brutal. 
MYERS: Sir, on the advice of my counsel and by the Constitution of the United States I'm not going to answer that question. 
COSTELLO: Oh, well. 
MYERS: Well, what else are you going to say?

Enron's Australian Unit Faces Being Placed in Liquidation
By Andrew Trounson

01/25/2002
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
MELBOURNE -- Enron Australia, a unit of collapsed U.S. energy trader Enron Corp., should be placed into liquidation, voluntary administrator Sims Lockwood said Friday.
Their recommendation, that will be made at a creditors meeting on Jan. 29, coincides with a dramatic decrease in the estimated value of Enron Australia's electricity trading derivatives book. 
While the value of the book is ""fluid,"" with some counterparties still yet to close out their positions amid a dispute over value, the administrator now forecasts that given the uncertainty the book value will at this stage only be enough to return around 37 cents in the dollar to creditors. 
In Australia, going into administration gives an insolvent or near-insolvent company breathing space to deal with its financial difficulties. The administrator investigates the company's affairs and gives creditors information to decide whether the company should be allowed to keep trading or wind up. 
Previously, the administrator had estimated the book value at 5.38 million million Australian dollars (US$2.8 million), which would have been enough to supply creditors with about 100 cents in the dollar. 
In a statement Friday, Sims Lockwood's Tony Sims said he was ""still working toward a dividend approaching 100 cents in the dollar and that this was still achievable if the book was valued on a consistent and commercially reasonable basis by all the counterparties."" 
But so far, the administrator has only been able to reach agreement on valuations with 12 of Enron Australia's 37 counterparties. 
Mr. Sims said that ""the administrators would recommend that the company be placed in liquidation at the meeting of creditors on 29 January."" 
At least three of Enron's largest debtors haven't closed out their transactions. 
""Legal advice suggests that in the event of liquidation, the liquidator may upon application to the court, force the counterparties to close out,"" Enron Australia said in the same statement. 
""The administrators will issue legal proceedings if necessary to ensure that a consistent and rigid framework applies to achieve a consistent and equitable outcome for both counterparties and Enron Australia stakeholders,"" Enron Australia said. 
Enron Australia appointed administrators after its U.S. parent filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection

Enron case already leads to several book deals

01/25/2002

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK (AP) - The Enron case already has produced several book deals, with publishers hoping to replicate the success of ""Barbarians at the Gate,"" the best seller about the fall of RJR Nabisco. 
Doubleday's Currency imprint has agreed on a six-figure deal with Houston-based journalist Mimi Swartz to write about it. The book, tentatively titled ""Power Failure,"" is scheduled for the fall.
""We hope this will resonate with people who liked `Barbarians at the Gate,""' Doubleday spokesman David Drake said Thursday. 
He promised ""a lively narrative"" about the Houston-based energy corporation that collapsed amid allegations of shady accounting and executive greed. The energy giant filed for bankruptcy protection last month, becoming the biggest corporate failure in U.S. history. 
One book Doubleday is unlikely to promote is ""Creative Destruction,"" a 2001 publication that praises Enron and others for ""overcoming cultural 'lock-in""' by, among other things, ""abandoning outdated, ingrown structures and rules and adopting new decision-making processes."" 
Meanwhile, a Texas-based journalist who has written about the energy industry, Robert Bryce, is working on ""Pipe Dreams,"" to be published by PublicAffairs in the fall. 
Bryce's editor, Lisa Kaufman, said the deal was worth as much ""as we have paid for any book"" and also cited ""Barbarians at the Gate"" as a model. 
""We all want to come out with `Barbarians at the Gate,""' she said with a laugh. 
A third book, ""Power Shock,"" is scheduled for a fall release by John Wiley & Sons. On its Internet site, Wiley also is pitching ""The Financial Numbers Game,"" a new advice book the publisher says will help readers ""avoid an Enron scenario.""

Charities planning to carry on without the benefit of Enron's philanthropic giving
By KRISTEN HAYS
Associated Press Writer

HOUSTON (AP) - The United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast expected a $6 million donation from Enron Corp. by March, but the group isn't counting on it now. 
As Enron grapples with bankruptcy and a sweeping reorganization, museums, arts organizations and charities like the United Way are making plans that no longer hinge on donations from the former energy giant.
The company regularly shared its wealth when it held the No. 7 spot on the Fortune 500 list and reported billions of dollars in annual revenue. But now Enron has laid off thousands of employees and seen the value of its stock virtually disappear, throwing future giving in doubt. 
""It's not been given at this point,"" said United Way spokesman Mario Gomez said of the $6 million. Last year, Enron gave $5.5 million to the group, which won't be able to assess the effect of losing this year's contribution until its current campaign to raise $78 million is over. 
Enron typically gave about 1 percent of its pretax earnings to various causes under the leadership of Kenneth Lay, who resigned Wednesday as chairman and chief executive. He will remain on Enron's board, and the company is searching for a new leader. 
Lay also gives privately through the Linda and Ken Lay Foundation. Internal Revenue Service records show the foundation took in $14 million in 2000 and donated $2.5 million to charities, museums and other organizations in Texas and across the country. 
Lay's company had an average philanthropic record for a corporation, said Tom Billitteri, an editor at the Chronicle of Philanthropy. 
In 2000, the most recent year for which figures are available, Enron came in 62nd out of 96 corporations across the country who responded to a Chronicle survey of charitable giving. 
That year, Pfizer Inc. topped the list, having given $340 million in cash and assets. Merck & Co. was second with $249 million, and Microsoft Corp. was third with $231 million. 
Enron donated $10.8 million that year. 
""There was nothing extraordinary about their philanthropic giving,"" Billitteri said. ""It was decent, but not unusual."" 
Enron hasn't formally suspended writing checks to charities, but the bankruptcy hinders its ability to give, company spokesman Mark Palmer said. 
""The creditors' committee does have to work with us to make sure everything we do is preserving the value of the estate, and that there's an equitable way to reorganize the company so we can pay back our creditors,"" Palmer said. 
The Houston Ballet became one of those creditors when a $15,000 check from Enron bounced two days before the Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing in New York. 
""It happened so quickly there was not anything to do at that point,"" said C.C. Conner, managing director of the ballet. 
She said Enron adds as much as $50,000 each year to the ballet's $12.5 million budget. Contributions are crucial, she said, because ticket sales don't cover the costs of putting on ballet performances. Ballet officials plan to seek other sources of funding. 
Still, Conner didn't think that the loss of Enron contributions amounted to a crisis. 
""If we had dozens of Enrons, we would have a real problem,"" she said. ""But one is not enough to cause a drastic problem."" 
Other beneficiaries are also adjusting to the loss of a major local source of philanthropy. The M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, one of the world's top cancer hospitals, no longer expects a donation of about $600,000 once promised by Enron. And the 6-year-old Holocaust Museum Houston, which depends on Enron for up to 10 percent of its annual budget, is planning to find that $235,000 elsewhere. 
M.D. Anderson named a cancer screening clinic after Enron when the company gave $1.5 million in a capital campaign. The hospital's current president, Dr. John Mendelsohn, and a former president, Dr. Charles LeMaistre, are members of Enron's 14-member board of directors. 
For other organizations, the expected loss of Enron donations has nearly been disastrous. 
The company pledged $2.4 million over the next decade for the Enron Boys & Girls Club, which opened Nov. 1 as the company entered its downward spiral. When Enron filed for bankruptcy, the club was left penniless and nearly had to shut down. 
On Thursday, club officials announced that the crisis had been averted. A Houston businessman had come to the rescue, offering to donate $1 million.

SMOKE AND MIRRORS

Enron became a smoke-and-mirror operation run by stogie-smoking, high-stakes gamblers. The name of the game was greed and they used the savings of trusting people, employees and investors, to stake their play. Many employees and investors lost a lot when Enron crumbled, and they deserve some remedy for their losses. But they should have seen, even through the fog of investors' greed, that things were amiss. 
Take, for example, the businesses and families across the country who were gouged last winter under the guise of a shortage of natural gas. Many paid monthly gas bills that equaled their mortgage payments, and Enron earned huge profits on the backs of those who used gas to keep from freezing. Did any Enron employee or investor question that corporate gain?
Shame on all of us that we have come to embrace greed as a way of life and believe that greed results in honest gain. Last summer, as Enron executives began cashing in their chips, it seemed they knew that they probably couldn't sustain similar profits through another winter and that a wave of gamblers' debt was coming due. At the same time, they were staring at the specter of a proposed merger with Dynegy and the reality that required financial disclosure would reveal Enron's hidden debt and misstated profit. 
Shame on a government that would allow an Enron to operate in a vacuum on its own terms and without regulation. The saddest and most shameful result of this fiasco is the damage done to our country, which represents itself as God-honoring. It probably wouldn't take too much more of this kind of corporate misbehavior to bring our capitalistic system down. That, in itself, is the best reason for the exercise of swift and sound judgment on the people who squandered our trust.

Everyone has an angle on the Enron debacle. But I haven't heard anyone point out the real scare on this topic yet: In short, nobody knew! I don't care if you read every business journal and article covering Enron and the industry during the past five years. Nobody knew the real story. 
And what should terrify the average American investor is if the seventh-largest corporation in the country can hide such a morass, what about the companies you are invested in?
Do you know who handles their accounting practices? Do you know how they structure their debt? How many offshore (potentially debt- hiding) accounts are represented by the companies in your 401(k) or standard-stock portfolio?

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

FOR MEN TIRED OF RECEIVING MALE-BASHING JOKES 

How many men does it take to open a beer? 
None.  It should be opened by the time she brings it.

Why is a Laundromat a really bad place to pick up a woman? 
Because a woman who can't even afford a washing machine will probably never 
be able to support you. 
---------------------------------------- 
Why do women have smaller feet than men? 
It's one of those ""evolutionary things"" that allows them to stand closer to 
the kitchen sink. 
---------------------------------------- 
How do you know when a woman is about to say something smart? 
When she starts her sentence with ""A man once told me..."" 
---------------------------------------- 
How do you fix a woman's watch? 
You don't.  There is a clock on the oven. 
---------------------------------------- 
Why do men break wind more than women? 
Because women can't shut up long enough to build up the required pressure. 
---------------------------------------- 
If your dog is barking at the back door and your wife is yelling at the 
front door, whom do you let in first? 
The dog, of course.  He'll shut up once you let him in.

A woman who won't do what she's told.

Our last fight was my fault: My wife asked me ""What's on the TV?""

Why do men die before their wives? 
They want to.

Laid-off Enron employees caught by health insurance glitch

01/05/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - A paperwork delay has caused the approximately 4,500 Enron Corp. workers laid off by the foundering energy giant to go without health insurance temporarily, forcing at least one ex-employee to put off cancer surgery. 
Many employees, including Mike Black, had planned to continue their Enron benefits after their expiration last month under federal rules set up by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, or COBRA.
But Black, who had to cancel skin cancer surgery set for last Thursday, and his fellow former Enron mates learned the company failed to complete all the necessary paperwork in time for coverage to continue into January. 
Enron planned to have COBRA information mailed to workers three weeks after their termination, but spokeswoman Karen Denne said it's taken longer than expected. 
Ex-workers should receive the paperwork by Jan. 15, Denne said. 
The delay has left Black, a systems programmer who can't afford the operation without insurance, in limbo. 
""I'm still waiting for my second unemployment check,"" Black said. 
Black, 54, said he's been unable to get any COBRA information from Enron, the insurance plan administrator or the insurance company. 
It seems as if ""they're all pointing fingers at each other,"" Black told the Houston Chronicle. 
Matt Isbell, president of consulting company COBRA Resources, said the problem is not unusual because of the complex process. Companies have 44 days to notify an individual they can buy the coverage, Isbell said. 
During that time, former workers are on their own until they receive COBRA coverage. After that, qualifying expenses are reimbursed. 
Black's not willing to front his surgery costs, however, because COBRA could disappear altogether if Enron switches its bankruptcy filing from Chapter 11, or reorganization, to Chapter 7, which is liquidation. 
Another worker, Candace Womack, didn't find out her insurance had lapsed until New Year's Day, when she got out of the hospital from heart surgery and needed to buy prescriptions. 
Womack, who worked in software support, carried health insurance for her family. 
""I'm getting a little ticked about the situation,"" said Womack, 51, who added that she was able to sign up for COBRA coverage before she walked out the door after she was laid off from another company in the mid-1990s.

Former Enron workers left in insurance limbo / Company fails to complete paperwork

Mike Black has skin cancer and was planning to have an operation Thursday. 
But he had to cancel the surgery when he discovered his health insurance plan is in limbo.
Like the rest of the 4,500 workers laid off from Enron Corp. Dec. 5, Black had health insurance coverage through the end of December and was planning to continue his coverage under the federal rules set up by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. 
But he found out this week Enron failed to finish all the necessary paperwork so the laid off workers could participate in COBRA beginning in January. 
COBRA requires employers to offer health insurance to their terminated employees for up to 18 months. Though COBRA is very expensive - the employee pays the entire cost of the plan, which is usually subsidized by an employer - it is designed to provide seamless health care coverage for the recently laid off worker. 
But Enron officials said the company hasn't been able to process the COBRA paperwork fast enough. 
The company planned to have the COBRA information mailed to workers 21 days after they were terminated but it's taken longer than Enron expected, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. The layoffs and bankruptcy filing were so sudden that the company didn't have time to prepare in advance. 
Employees should receive the COBRA paperwork by Jan. 15, Denne said. If they don't, they should contact the benefits office. 
A benefits consultant in Houston said she isn't surprised about Enron's delay. COBRA can be a ""paperwork nightmare."" Documentation has to be sent to not just all employees but to all the employee dependents who are covered, she said, asking not to be identified. 
But to employees like Black, the delay is devastating. When his insurance coverage couldn't be verified, Black said he couldn't afford to pay for the operation out of his own pocket. 
""I'm still waiting for my second unemployment check,"" he said. 
Black is frustrated because he can't get any information about COBRA insurance from Enron. He said that when he calls the company's benefits office, employees there don't know the answers to his questions. Neither does the plan administrator, and the insurance company seems to be in the dark, too, he said. 
It seems as if ""they're all pointing fingers at each other,"" said Black, who was a systems programmer at Enron. 
Enron could have done it faster, he said, suggesting that arranging COBRA coverage is low on the company's priority list. 
It's not an unusual problem, said Matt Isbell, president of COBRA Resources, a company that conducts COBRA training seminars in Kalamazoo, Mich. 
Companies have at least 44 days to notify an individual employee that they can buy COBRA coverage, Isbell said. And depending on a company's plan documents, that waiting period can be even longer if the clock doesn't start until the last day of regular insurance coverage. 
During that time, employees have to foot their own medical bills, he said. But once the employee applies for COBRA and pays for it, the bills are reimbursed. 
Black knows that but he's worried that Enron may convert its bankrupty filing from a Chapter 11, which provides protection from creditors while undergoing reorganization, to a Chapter 7, which would liquidate the company. If that happened, health insurance would disappear and so would COBRA, leaving the 54-year-old with a bunch of unpaid bills. 
Candace Womack found out she had no insurance when her husband went to the pharmacy Wednesday to fill several prescriptions. Womack had just had heart surgery and was released from the hospital New Year's Day. 
Instead of paying the $10 co-pays, her husband had to pony up $250 to pay for antibiotics and blood pressure medicine because Womack's insurance had been canceled. Womack worked in software support for Enron until she lost her job last month. 
Now she's worried about how she'll pay for the follow-up medical visits to her surgeon. 
Like many of the laid-off employees, Womack carried the insurance for her family. Her husband is self-employed, and it's usually much more expensive to buy an individual insurance policy than it is to pay for a company subsidized plan like Enron's. 
""I'm getting a little ticked about the situation,"" said Womack, who is 51. 
Womack said the disaster she faces now is in such sharp contrast to when she lost her job in the mid-1990s. 
Then, she had been working for First Interstate bank and was able to sign up for COBRA coverage before she even walked out the door.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Bidders line up in battle for Enron stake.
By ROBERT CLOW and ANDREW HILL.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Bidders line up in battle for Enron stake - COLLAPSE AT LEAST THREE COMPANIES LIKELY TO BID FOR CORE ENERGY TRADING BUSINESS. 
At least three companies are likely to bid for control of Enron's core energy trading business by today's deadline, according to the bankrupt US company's advisers.
Citigroup, the US bank that is also one of Enron's main creditors, is likely to be one of the bidders, according to other people close to the process. 
It will not be clear until later in the week if all the potential bidders have submitted offers, but if the auction is successful, it will boost the confidence of Enron creditors. 
Any delay in striking a deal could damage the chances of Enron reviving its trading operations and restructuring the rest of the company. Enron's traders are locked in by incentives for a limited time, and trading counterparties, bruised by the sudden collapse of the company, are already sceptical about dealing with a revitalised trading operation 
Enron advisers said yesterday that all the potential buyers of a majority stake were sufficiently creditworthy to restore customers' confidence in the trading business. ""That (creditworthiness) is not a problem,"" said Martin Bienenstock of Weil Gotshal & Manges, Enron's lawyer. 
""We're expecting a number of bids,"" said a spokesman for Blackstone Group, financial adviser to Enron, yesterday. 
The auction will be held on Thursday and a bankruptcy court hearing has been scheduled for Friday to approve a partner for the trading operation. 
Enron hopes to auction off the assets, technology and key staff of its core trading operation, forming a joint venture in which the energy group would maintain a minority stake. 
Banks, led by Citigroup, are the most likely buyers of a majority stake. UBS of Switzerland had expressed interest before Christmas, but the Swiss bank's enthusiasm for making an offer has cooled since, according to people involved. Neither bank would comment last week. 
People close to the procedure said last week that Enron's cash flow was better than originally expected and it had not yet drawn on the $250m of emergency funds available as part of its $1.5bn debtor-in-possession financing package. They said Enron might even reduce the size of the loan to avoid paying unnecessary charges. 
In a separate hearing today, a number of Texas creditors will argue for the whole procedure to be switched from New York to Houston, where Enron has its headquarters.

Companies diary - Crucial stage in Enron saga comes into spotlight.

The latest moves in the Enron saga take place, with this week being crucial to the future of operations. The deadline passes for bids, while the formal auction takes place and the buyer may be approved for the energy trading unit. A series of post-Christmas trading updates from UK retailers will be examined for indications of the strength of consumer spending. 
MONDAY
Monday is the deadline for companies to bid to form a joint venture with Enron's energy trading business, the core of the bankrupt company. Citigroup and UBS had both expressed interest in the business, which Enron believes can be revived with the help of a credit-worthy partner. A formal auction will be held by the bankruptcy court on Thursday, assuming more than one company comes forward, and a hearing has been set for Friday to approve a buyer. Administrators to Enron Corporation are close to the sale of the London-based metals trading business of the collapsed US energy group. The deal, which would be the third significant disposal to be negotiated in the UK since Enron's European operations were put into administration at the end of November, could be announced within days. Potential buyers for all or parts of the business are Glencore, the Swiss commodities trader, Sempra Energy of San Diego, HSBC and Goldman Sachs. PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is acting as administrator, is understood to have singled out one of the interested parties and is expected to finalise the sale over the weekend or early next week. A sale had been expected before Christmas, but was delayed because of difficulties in unravelling the complex corporate structure. TUESDAY 
Alcoa, the world's largest producer of aluminium, is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings per share of 10 cents, far short of the 45 cents earned a year ago, as anaemic demand for aluminium in the auto and aerospace sectors is expected to strongly hit impact the company's bottom line, analysts said. Two weeks ago Alcoa pre-announced its fourth-quarter earnings per share expectations of 10 cents, excluding a $225m after-tax restructuring charge. Lower volumes, depressed metal prices and an overall weak downstream market will all weigh on fourth-quarter results, trimming full-year earnings to $1.43 compared with $1.81 last year. The company's current estimate of 10 cents is well below the previous forecast of Wall Street analysts' consensus of 30 cents. AFX, New York 
Interim figures from Pace Micro Technology, the UK television set-top box maker, may contain news on progress in the US. It said at the final results announcement in July that sales in the US were likely to grow faster than in the more mature UK market. In that context, investors may be keen to hear how contracts with AOL Time Warner and Comcast of the US are progressing. Analysts expect Malcolm Miller, chief executive of Pace, to announce a rise from GBP18.4m ($26.7m) in profits before exceptionals to GBP19.3m, on sales up from GBP205.8m to GBP215.7m in the six months to the end of November. 
One of the most eagerly-awaited of the post-Christmas trading statements is expected from Next, the UK clothing retailer. It said on the morning of September 11 that like-for-like sales were up 8 per cent, while Next Directory sales were 20 per cent ahead of the previous year. 
WEDNESDAY 
Oc, the Dutch repro-graphics group, will report for the fiscal year to November 30 net profit before extraordinary items of 106.7m-109m, down from 152m ($133.8m) a year earlier, analysts said. Earnings per share after preferred dividends are forecast to fall to 1.14-1.21 from 1.76 a year earlier. In a pre-announcement in December, the company forecast a 30 per cent fall in net profit before extraordinary items with sales unchanged. Oce also plans to take a restructuring charge of 125m. AFX, Amsterdam 
Interim figures from Dixons, the UK consumer electronics retailer, are expected to be between GBP80m-GBP87m for the six months to October, against GBP90.8m before exceptionals and losses at Freeserve, the sale of which makes comparisons difficult. However, a trading update is likely to overshadow the figures.

Enron nears crucial decision on trading arm.
By ANDREW HILL AND ROBERT CLOW IN NEW YORK.

Enron will find out whether there is sufficient interest in its core energy trading operations to justify an auction of a majority stake this week. 
According to people close to the bankruptcy procedure, potential bidders were still conducting due diligence examinations of the business late last week.
The deadline for formal offers is Monday. If there are enough bids, the bankruptcy court will hold an auction on Thursday. A court hearing has been scheduled for Friday to approve a partner for the trading operation. 
Enron hopes to auction off the assets, technology and key staff of its core trading operation, forming a joint venture with a creditworthy buyer, possibly a bank, in which the energy group would maintain a minority stake. The trading book is unlikely to be sold because of the size of Enron's liabilities to customers. 
A long delay would be fatal to the prospects of reviving the business. Traders are locked in by incentives for a limited time and trading counterparties, bruised by the collapse of Enron, are already sceptical about dealing with a revitalised trading operation. 
Martin Bienenstock of Weil Gotshal & Manges, Enron's lawyer, warned before Christmas that if the deal was not closed in early January, traders would ""simply be compelled to find other jobs with other financial entities"". 
Citigroup is more likely to take a stake in the business, but it has not yet come forward with a stalking-horse offer, which would set a base for the auction. Interest from UBS has cooled, according to people involved. Neither bank would comment. Rival energy companies said they were unlikely to become partners of the trading business. 
The creditors' committee might still select a stalking-horse, but one creditor said that even without an opening bid the committee was confident that a partner would be found. 
People close to the procedure said last week that Enron's cash flow was better than had been expected and it had not yet drawn on the $250m of emergency funds available as part of the $1.5bn debtor-in-possession financing package arranged last month. 
Court approval of the package has been postponed to January 30, but bankers have played down concerns that it would be difficult to syndicate the final $1bn tranche of the loan. 
In a separate hearing on Monday, the New York bankruptcy court will hear arguments for the procedure to be switched to Houston where Enron has its headquarters.

OTC regulation flaws exposed by Enron.
By NIKKI TAIT.

01/07/2002
Financial Times - FT.com
(c) 2002 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

The furore over Enron - and cries from some quarters for greater regulation - come exactly one year after the US believed that it had put to rest the issue of derivatives trading supervision. 
On a Friday night, December 15 2000, Congress passed complex and highly technical legislation which essentially ensured that much of the $94,000bn over-the-counter derivatives industry would operate outside the nation's commodities laws.
Senator Phil Gramm helped to resurrect the legislation after the House agriculture committee added a special exemption from regulation for EnronOnline, according to Michael Greenberger, a former official of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The package, attached to 200 pages of legislation of an 11,000-page general public funding bill, was barely noticed in the rush to adjourn Congress. 
Much of America's regulatory regime was devised at a time when derivatives trading consisted mainly of standardised futures contracts transacted through third-party exchanges like the Chicago Board of Trade, and involving traditional commodity products such as corn or soyabeans. 
But during the 1980s and 1990s, a good deal of risk-management action had shifted to the over-the-counter market, where banks and trading firms negotiated bilateral contracts (often called ""swaps"") on an individual basis. There had also been phenomenal growth in financial contracts - hedging interest rate or currency exposures, for example. Finally, the proliferation of electronic trading systems made it easier to transact business outside the US, if regulatory regimes were kinder elsewhere. 
For participants in the swaps markets one of the biggest concerns is that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, set up to regulate the futures markets, might seek to extend some authority to OTC markets. Brooksley Born, head of the agency in the late-1990s, felt strongly about the issue and the problems at Long-Term Capital Management offered her some vindication. 
But swaps dealers argued that if swaps were deemed futures (giving the CFTC jurisdiction), counterparties with losing positions could argue the deals had been transacted illegally. Accordingly, the big Wall Street banks demanded ""legal certainty"", to ensure that OTC transactions were not caught in the regulatory net. Satisfying that demand was one important element of last December's legislation. 
Separately, the legislation also set out a new regulatory structure for exchanges - with the degree of supervision highly dependent on the type of product traded and the nature of market participants. Certain commodity products, in finite supply, are susceptible to manipulation. Moreover, if retail customers were to be involved with a market, there would be a need for a decent degree of oversight. Conversely, sophisticated players, trading hard-to-manipulate financial contracts, could look after themselves. 
Little of this applied to EnronOnline, however. Although outsiders may have viewed its trading activities as equivalent to an exchange, EnronOnline was structured so that the company itself was the counterparty to transactions handled by its trading unit. That made its business model very different from a traditional exchange, which serves as a neutral forum. 
Few of the participants in last year's debate seem to have changed their views significantly. But regulators who believed that largely-unsupervised OTC trades could be a Pandora's box in future, still think last year's legislation a regressive step. ""The Commodity Futures Modernisation Act [of 2000] sanctioned opaque markets,"" says Michael Greenberger, former director of the trading and markets division of the CFTC. 
Conversely, observers in the swaps industry argue Enron's difficulties did not originate in its trading activities - the trading operations suffered when other problems caused the group's credit standings to collapse. ""EnronOnline was a highly innovative means of servicing clients for nine months of the year,"" says Robert Pickel, executive director of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, stressing that the trading arm had provided ""convenient and cost-effective management of risk"". 
However, even advocates of the lighter, less proscriptive regulatory regime had cautioned that the relatively new area of energy derivatives trading could pose issues that trading of financial swaps did not. 
""Most dealers in the swaps market are either financial institutions subject to supervision by bank regulatory agencies, or affiliates of broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, or affiliates of FCMs [futures trading firms] subject to CFTC oversight,"" Bill Rainer, the CFTC's former chairman told a congressional committee in June. ""The same cannot be said of trading in energy derivatives ... Thus a principal argument warranting the exclusion of financial derivatives from the Commodity Exchange Act - the fact that derivatives trading in these products is subject to direct or indirect federal oversight - does not apply to OTC energy transactions.""

Outlook
Enron? We're Missing The Point
Lanny J. Davis

01/06/2002
The Washington Post
FINAL
B01
Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

Here's a paradox: Despite predictions of doom from many financial writers, it doesn't matter very much that Enron -- at one time touted as the seventh-largest company in the nation -- failed. What matters is why it failed. 
Enron's demise will be little more than a blip on the U.S. economy, with the big losers confined to the same financial speculators who rode the bubble on the way up. But the underlying cause of Enron's fall -- a corporate culture of secrecy and obfuscation -- is not unique to that company. Far from it. Enron's problems are emblematic of myriad public companies in the 1990s, from dot-com start-ups to some of America's biggest corporations, who yielded to the pressure to inflate their stock by whatever means possible.
If that culture isn't replaced by more transparency and accountability, regulated and enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and U.S. prosecutors, the credibility and integrity of the various stock markets in which millions of Americans are now invested could be seriously undermined. That's why I hope that Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) meant it when he said Wednesday -- after his Senate Governmental Affairs Committee announced it would subpoena Enron's top executives and directors -- that the committee's focus will be ""to make sure that something like this never happens again."" 
I know something about the culture of obfuscation. I have spent much of the past three years representing public companies and executives accused of accounting and financial fraud. Sometimes I have been lucky enough to be called in before the bad news hit the fan. But more frequently, I arrived after information had begun to leak out. 
In one instance, the new CEO of a Nasdaq-listed company, Lernout & Hauspie Speech Products, retained me and my law firm. He told me he suspected that the books of the language translation software company had been cooked by the company's former CEO. The company, he said, had created the appearance of dramatic growth by establishing outside entities -- investment companies in which money from investors was being used to purchase what turned out to be mostly nonexistent products and services. Liabilities and losses were being hidden in these entities and not included in the company's financial statements. 
The new CEO suspected that some members of the board of directors might be complicit. The Wall Street Journal had been writing bits and pieces of the story, but the company, based in Belgium, had either stonewalled or had given out misinformation. 
We quickly initiated a two-part strategy based on complete transparency: First, we decided to support an investigation by outside auditors and a new law firm, with a commitment to publish the results and cooperate fully with the SEC; second, we proposed a program of internal reform to clean up the last vestiges of misleading financial reporting. While we knew the company's high-flying stock would take a major beating once we made these disclosures, we believed this strategy offered the only hope for the survival of the company. 
However, we ran into a glitch. The company's board of directors opposed full disclosure. The new CEO defied the board and directed me to give the report to the Wall Street Journal and to other newspapers and to post it on the company's Web site. We both agreed he had no alternative if he were to avoid becoming part of the coverup. One immediate result of our strategy: The new CEO was summarily fired by the board -- as were my law firm and I. Another result: A short time later, the company filed for bankruptcy and was liquidated. The former CEO and some board members were charged with fraud and stock manipulation. All have denied these allegations. The investigation is continuing. 
So you can see why I took such an interest in the rise and fall of Enron. As Yogi Berra would say, ""It's de{acute}ja{grv} vu all over again."" Enron, too, developed outside entities that supposedly generated revenues for the company, while keeping the expenses and contingent liabilities associated with those transactions off the books. And Enron's business, like Lernout & Hauspie's, didn't focus on selling real products to consumers with real profit margins. Rather, Enron was essentially a broker: It bought, resold and invested in commodities futures contracts, gambling on future prices and market conditions. One example of this business model is a brokerage company such as Goldman Sachs. But perhaps a more apt analogy is Las Vegas. 
It really didn't matter what commodities Enron was betting on. Although it was known as an energy company, trading in natural gas and electricity contracts, it also speculated in water contracts, advertising and time contracts, complex derivatives, broadband capacity futures and weather derivatives (whatever that means). Its former chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, actually once boasted about the company's absence of hard assets. He proudly described its approach as ""asset lite,"" adding: ""In the old days, people worked for assets. We've turned it around -- what we've said is, the assets work for people."" 
This characterization is the key to understanding both the breathtaking speed of Enron's collapse and the reason its failure will not have much impact on the nation's economy. Enron's geometric growth from a sleepy natural gas pipeline company in the '80s to a global giant -- with 21,000 employees, 3,500 subdivisions around the world and, by the summer of 2000, a total ""market capitalization"" value of more than $80 billion -- was based on perception rather than reality. As long as everyone saw the stock price going higher and higher, people were willing to bet their money (through loans, equity investments and credit on trades) on Enron. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., for example, lent Enron $500 million without security and another $400 million purportedly secured by something. 
But if you live by the perception and the illusion of growth, then you die by it once reality sets in. Being ""asset lite"" meant that once Enron's numbers and disclosures became suspect, there was no foundation of hard assets -- real products with real value -- to fall back on. Not surprisingly, once the first card of credibility was lost, the rest of the house collapsed quickly. On Oct. 17, Enron was forced to announce that it had hidden $1 billion of losses resulting from the outside entities; the next day it reduced its assets by $1.2 billion. Just six weeks later, on Dec. 2, after weeks of putting out deceptive information, Enron filed for bankruptcy. Its stock price had fallen from $90 a share in the previous year to just 87 cents. 
The fallout? Thousands of Enron employees who lost their jobs and much of the value of their 401(k) pension plans, which included now-worthless Enron stock, will feel a deep impact. Because of decisions made by senior management, these employees were not allowed to sell the stock as it was dropping in value, though those same managers had sold nearly $1 billion worth of shares throughout the year. Others likely to suffer from the company's failure are the banks, investors and trading partners who willingly advanced Enron their money as the stock soared. 
But it's hard to feel much sympathy there. Consumers won't really notice the difference. The electricity, natural gas and water supplies that were the subject of Enron futures contracts will still be delivered to their homes one way or the other. Speculators in Enron's ""weather derivatives"" may have lost some money, but that's not likely to have much effect on whether it rains or shines each day. 
So if Enron's fall doesn't really matter in macroeconomic terms, why should we care? Because the corporate culture that bred that failure has undermined trust in the integrity of the public markets. The goal of ""meeting the numbers"" projected by analysts for each quarter has too often become the overriding goal -- to be achieved in the accounting department if it cannot be achieved in the marketplace. As Michael R. Young has written in ""Accounting Irregularities and Financial Fraud,"" his seminal book, ""What moves financial markets is the published expectations of Wall Street analysts."" They ""are perceived to establish, within a very narrow margin, the parameters for the upcoming actual financial results. Analyst expectations have become, in effect, a company's reported earnings."" 
With millions of Americans now invested in the stock market, this is no longer a concern limited to financial elites. We cannot afford to preserve a system in which perception is more important than reality. 
The solutions are as obvious as they are unlikely to be met. The rule of thumb must be transparency, in word as well as deed. On a technical level, accounting rules and disclosure requirements have to be tightened up. Off-balance-sheet entities that create even the slightest contingent liabilities should be incorporated into the company's publicly filed financial information. We must also move to a system of real-time financial disclosures, with online access to the latest financial information. This is what SEC policymakers and congressional investigators should concentrate on. 
In addition, white-collar criminals who cook the books should be prosecuted, sent to jail and required to disgorge profits from all stock sales made during the period of fraud, rather than receiving what is too often a slap on the wrist and a reminder to the corporate world that crime can pay. 
Finally, corporate managers must practice the basic rules of crisis management -- which may mean defying the advice of many of their lawyers -- when they learn about bad news that could hurt the company's stock price. The truth will come out anyway, and dribs and drabs will only make its impact worse. So you might as well put it out yourself -- and then do something to fix the problem. 
Of course, this advice to tell all the truth has been rejected, time and again, and not only by business executives. It has been ignored by politicians as well. The effect on the public's trust -- whether shareholders' or voters' -- has been the same.

Investors to be more wary of credit products.
By JENNY WIGGINS.

As Enron's bankruptcy has rippled through the markets, inflicting losses on holders of its shares and bonds, the credit derivatives market is among the sectors counting the costs of the energy trader's failure. 
EnronOnline, which rapidly became the world's largest e-commerce site, was best known for its role in natural gas, power and crude oil trading. But at its height it offered more than 1,200 products, including bandwidth derivatives, weather derivatives, emissions credits, pipeline capacity and credit derivatives.
The credit derivatives market has exploded in recent years, with the global market for credit derivative contracts growing from about $50bn in 1996 to more than $1,200bn today. 
The market has become ever more sophisticated, evolving into an alternative to the cash market. 
Enron was one of the market's most active players, being both a dealer and a traded company. Through a credit derivatives exchange known as Enron Credit it encouraged other companies to use Enron to manage their credit exposure. 
But following the collapse, and the negative impact on some of the credit derivative structures to which Enron was exposed, industry players predict investors will approach the market with greater caution. 
""You're going to see people kind of stepping back and looking at collateral and thinking about the structures before they buy,"" says John Tierney, head of credit derivatives research at Deutsche Bank. 
Investors are also likely to look more closely at the way rating agencies assess credit derivative structures, he adds. Ratings agencies have put numerous US and European credit derivative transactions containing Enron exposure on review for downgrade, reflecting possible losses for investors. 
Previously an investment grade company with large amounts of debt and good liquidity, Enron was at one time an attractive asset to trade in the credit default swap market. 
Credit default swaps are the most commonly traded credit derivative, providing insurance-like protection from the risk of default. There are two parties in a credit default swap: one party (the protection seller) receives a premium from another party (the protection buyer) for assuming the credit risk of a specified entity. In return for the premium, the protection buyer receives a payment from the seller in the case of the specified entity undergoing a ""credit event"", such as a default. 
Total exposure to Enron via the credit derivative market has been estimated at as much as $6.3bn by Standard & Poor's. Much of this exposure occurred through complicated structured finance vehicles known as synthetic collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). These sell credit protection through a portfolio of credit default swaps, pooling a large number of credits, typically credits which are investment-grade. 
CDOs give investors the opportunity to participate in a range of ""tranches"" of varying credit quality. The most junior tranche, often referred to as the ""equity"" portion of the deal because it offers a high, equity-like return, is the most risky. 
Insurance companies and banks are among the biggest investors in CDOs. The structures provide insurance companies with a means of diversifying credit risk and offer relatively high rates of return. 
Analysts and ratings agencies say exposure to Enron via CDOs should be ""manageable"". But the downgrading of many CDO transactions following Enron's collapse shows the difficulty of gauging many of the risks. 
Although exposure to individual credits within synthetic CDO transactions are limited to very small amounts - exposure to any one credit is usually less than 2 per cent of the pool - the amount of leverage can be quite high, because the first-loss or junior portion of the tranche is typically quite small. Consequently, even investors in senior tranches of the transaction are vulnerable to sudden defaults. 
Money managers are more wary than insurers of CDOs, citing the transactions' opaque nature. Many are private, and transaction managers often do not reveal immediately the names of companies involved, making it difficult to assess credit risk, fund managers say. 
With CDO transactions so difficult to assess, the ratings agencies have acknowledged that quantification of exposure to Enron in the derivatives market remains ""incomplete"".

Last week, the Senate's government affairs committee became the fourth congressional panel to pile on Enron, announcing a two-pronged inquiry into the bankrupt energy giant that will look into both malfeasance within the company as well as possible lapses by federal regulators. 
But according to staffers from other committees that are already investigating the collapse, the folks at government affairs, which quickly issued subpoenas for documents from Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen, may have bit off more than they can chew.
The reason: it seems getting documents from Enron is proving more costly than originally expected. Because the company is currently in bankruptcy protection, company lawyers have insisted it cannot pay copying fees for the papers the committees want, leaving congressional staffers to fork out the cash for duplication. 
And the fees are beginning to rack up. While there are no estimates as to costs incurred thus far, the House energy and commerce committee - expected to take the lead in the probes because of its wide-ranging jurisdiction over both energy policy and accounting standards - expects to have 2m documents by the end of the month. 
Senator Carl Levin, who chairs the government affairs subcommittee on investigations, said he had not requested any additional funding for his probe, adding that he believed some reallocation of resources, including using congressional fellows already detailed to the committee, would cover any additional expenses. 
But other Capitol Hill denizens are not so sanguine. Said one staffer from a rival committee: ""The fact that there are tens of thousands of these documents - that may take some of the steam out of them.""

Wiser Oil Seeks Separate Enron Power Creditor Panel

DJ CFA SOURCE:Bankruptcy 

ISSUER: ENRON CORP. 
SYMBOL: ENE 


(This story was originally published Friday evening.) 

By Carol McCleary 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones) - A movement is underway to have a separate 
committee formed in Enron Corp.'s (ENE) bankruptcy case to represent power 
generators and traders, who contend that the current creditors' committee 
can't adequately protect their interests. 

Wiser Oil Co. (WZR) is among a group of Enron creditors who are concerned 
with the way the U.S. Trustee comprised the creditors' committee - appointing 
debtor-in-possession lenders to the panel. 

The committee should be acting as the watchdog in the case, Wiser's 
counsel Van Oliver said. He questioned how the lenders can exercise their 
fiduciary duties as committee members. 

A number of parties holding claims arising out of hedging contracts have 
concerns with the way the committee has been set up to represent the 
interests of Enron and not its subsidiaries, particularly Enron North 
America, Oliver told Dow Jones Newswires. 



There is also concern with the way the debtor's counsel has been 
""mashing"" all of the assets of Enron and its subsidiary debtors into one 
basket, Oliver said. 

The company hasn't yet filed its financial schedules - the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code gives it four months from the Chapter 11 petition date to do 
so. 

Noting that Enron and its subsidiaries prepare consolidated balance 
sheets and income statements, Oliver said creditors don't know what the 
subsidiaries themselves have in terms of assets and liabilities. 

The cash management system in place isn't protective of the subsidiaries' 
claims, according to Oliver. 

Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Williams Cos. (WMB) are also involved in the 
effort to have a separate committee appointed, people familiar with the 
matter said. Oliver declined to identify those involved with Wiser, but said 
that the parties together hold claims of at least $100 million and possibly 
more than $500 million. 

A motion is expected to be filed within the next couple of weeks asking 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan to order the trustee to appoint the 
separate committee or, alternatively, appoint a subcommittee to represent the 
power generators/traders. 

As reported by Dow Jones Newswires, a hearing on the company's DIP 
financing agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C) has 
been postponed to Jan. 30. A $1.5 billion DIP loan was initially planned, 
but, sources said the lenders are reworking the facility based on Enron's 
better-than-anticipated cash position, as well as lingering apathy among 
bankers recruited to take part in the loan. 

A change of venue request by several creditors who are seeking to move 
the bankruptcy case to Houston from New York remains set for hearing before 
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez on Monday. The creditors are seeking to move the 
bankruptcy case to Houston from New York.

A group of Enron Corp. creditors will try to persuade a New York bankruptcy judge today to move the case to a court in Houston, where the energy company is based. 
Large creditors, such as energy traders Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Corp., and smaller ones, such as the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of Colorado, believe it would be more convenient and economical to hear the case near the location of many of Enron creditors and assets. Dynegy and El Paso are based in Houston.
In a motion filed by Dynegy and other creditors, lawyers also say there is ""an emotional interest to be served"" by moving the case to Houston, where thousands of Enron employees were laid off and many more witnessed the rapid evaporation of their retirement plans when the company's stock plummeted. 
Analysts say these creditors might also be hoping for a potentially more favorable hearing in Houston, where the economy has suffered as a result of Enron's demise. 
Lawyers for Enron, and a handful of creditors opposed to relocating the proceedings, are expected to argue that it would be less expensive and more accommodating if the case were administered in New York, home to the armies of lawyers and bankers working on both sides. 
Howard B. Comet, an attorney for Weil, Gotshal & Manges in New York, said it also would be easier for business partners and potential witnesses involved in Enron's worldwide operations to participate if the proceedings took place in New York. 
""The focus of the financial restructuring is here,"" Comet said. 
Citigroup Inc. of New York, Barclays Bank of London and Dresdner Bank of Frankfurt are among the creditors opposed to changing venues. 
Under the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure, a case may be transferred from one district court to another ""in the interest of justice or for the convenience of the parties."" 
The basic criteria considered by judges ruling on previous change-of-venue motions have been the proximity of creditors, debtors and witnesses; the location of assets; and the cost. 
Experts say few cases of this size have been moved but Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez could be swayed by the fact that so many of Enron's energy-trading partners are in and around Houston. 
Enron collapsed late last year when revelations of questionable accounting practices and mounting debt caused investors and traders to lose confidence in the company. The company lost $60 billion in market value over the last year. 
Enron filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law Dec. 2 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.

Dynegy Gets Info From Enron Related To Venue Motion

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

(This report was originally published late Friday.)
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In another concession to its former merger partner, Enron Corp. (ENE) agreed late Friday to provide Dynegy Inc. (DYN) with certain information about the role that some Enron executives will play in the company's financial restructuring. 
Details are still scarce, but essentially, this means that Dynegy will no longer need to depose Enron's Chief Financial Officer, Jeffrey McMahon, in an effort to obtain information that may be relevant to Dynegy's motion to transfer the distressed company's bankruptcy case to Houston, lawyers for both companies said. 
Judge Arthur Gonzalez, of the Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, is set to hear this and other motions to transfer the case Monday. 
It's the second time in the past day that Dynegy has gotten the upper hand over Enron, and follows an agreement by the two companies earlier Friday to hand over control of a valuable pipeline to Dynegy. 
Last month, Dynegy served McMahon and three other Enron executives with subpoenas for depositions, but later said it only needed to question McMahon. At the time, Dynegy said that a deposition was necessary to determine, among other things, why the bankrupt company filed for court protection in New York instead of Houston. 
Most of Enron's assets and creditors are in Texas, making it more convenient and economical for the case to be heard there, according to Dynegy. 
Enron, following a Wednesday court hearing, has provided Dynegy with enough information that the latter sees no immediate need for a deposition. 
This includes details about which of Enron's executives are involved in the company's financial restructuring, according to Howard Comet, of Weil, Gotshal & Manges - which is representing Enron - and about which executives have detailed knowledge of the two companies' adversarial proceedings. 
Dynegy had also requested information about the Enron's estimated financial reorganization budget, which isn't yet available, according to Comet. 
But people familiar with the matter have told Dow Jones Newswires that Enron presented financial information, including its budget for reorganization, to debtor-in-possession lenders J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C) recently. 
In recent weeks, Dynegy, Enron's 401(k) plan holders, El Paso and other creditors have all filed motions asking that the largest bankruptcy case in corporate history be transferred to the Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of Texas. 
About a dozen financial institutions, including J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, objected to the move. 
Moving the cases ""would frustrate, rather than further, the interest of justice"" because Enron's list of 20 largest unsecured creditors is dominated by institutions located in, or controlled from, New York, J.P. Morgan said in a court filing.

Bush's rst big scandal rises from the ashes of Enron
Rupert Cornwell in Washington

01/06/2002
The Independent - London
FOREIGN

(Copyright 2002 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)

It may not yet quite be the ""cancer on the presidency"" of which John Dean warned Richard Nixon in the early days of Watergate. But the collapse of the energy conglomerate Enron is suddenly shaping up as big, big trouble for George Bush. 
All the ingredients of a classic Washington scandal are there: the biggest corporate failure in history, a chief executive on such good terms with George Bush that the President refers to him as ""Kenny Boy"" and a history of massive contributions by the Houston-based Enron to the White House campaigns of Bush the father and Bush the son.
The final element fell into place last week with the announcement of a full-scale Senate investigation, complete with subpoenas for top Enron executives including Kenneth Lay (aka ""Kenny Boy""), representatives of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm which singularly failed to spot the impending disaster, and perhaps senior figures in the Bush administration as well. 
Even the cast of characters is comfortingly familiar. Enron's lead attorney, for instance, is Robert Bennett, the $500-an-hour DC superlawyer who featured in Washington's most recent presidential scandal when he represented Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit. That led directly to the Monica Lewinsky saga. 
By any yardstick, Enron is a massive financial scandal, a tale of concealed debt and shell companies, incompetent auditing and scanty regulatory oversight - not to mention the sudden impoverishment of thousands of employees obliged to hold their pension savings in now worthless Enron shares, even as senior executives cashed in stock and stock options for up to $1bn (pounds 700m) during 2000 and 2001. 
Until now, however, Enron has been the dog which failed to bark - or, more exactly, was ignored as the media concentrated on Afghanistan and barely dared mention such goings-on as the presidential approval ratings hovered around the 90 per cent mark. Enron unravelled in November, but not until 28 December was Mr Bush first asked about the debacle. All that is about to change as the news focus starts to shift from the anti-terror campaign to domestic politics. Not only is this a mid-term election year in which the Democrats need just half-a-dozen seats to recapture the House of Representatives, but thoughts are already turning to the 2004 White House race. In all these calculations, Enron could prove a factor. 
Already, at least three Congressional committees have been sniffing around the affair. But the main investigation will be conducted by the Senate's governmental affairs committee, headed by the Democrat Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. Mr Lieberman, it will not be forgotten, was Al Gore's vice- presidential running mate last time and is is widely believed to have ambitions for the top job in 2004. 
Thus far, Mr Lieberman has followed the Washington scandal script to a T. Echoing investigators of Watergate, Iran-Contra and Whitewater before him, he promises solemnly that his probe will be even-handed, ""a search for the truth, not a witchhunt"". But, he warns, ""we're going to go wherever the search takes us"". If so, it could be a most interesting journey. 
Enron has been a fountain of money for politicians of every hue. Since 1990, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which monitors such donations, it has made campaign contributions of $5.8m (pounds 4m), three- quarters of it to Republicans. The biggest single beneficiaries, unsurprisingly, have been the two Texas senators, Kay Bailey Hutchinson and Phil Gramm, whose wife Wendy sits on the Enron board. 
Like most big corporate donors, it has hedged its bets. On Capitol Hill, 71 of the 100 current senators and nearly half the 435 congressmen have received contributions. The investment paid off with a vengeance, when Enron secured exemption for its energy derivatives business under a 2000 Act regulating commodity futures trading. But the Bush family has been a special object of its attentions. Mr Lay was listed by the Bush-Cheney campaign as one of the ""Pioneers"" who raised at least $100,000 (pounds 70,000) for the election, while Enron gave $100,000 to the inauguration gala, a contribution matched by ""Kenny Boy"" and his wife. 
Potentially most damaging is its possible backstage role in the formulation of Mr Bush's energy policy. At least four Enron consultants and executives have done work for the administration. A champion of the deregulation favoured by the White House, Mr Lay was a frequent informal adviser to the panel under the Vice-President, Dick Cheney, which drew up a national energy strategy. 
""We've got to ask whether the advice tendered was self-serving,"" Mr Lieberman says. Or, to put it more bluntly, were the Texan oilman in the White House and the Texan energy baron in Houston running a mutual benefit society? These questions can no longer escape an answer.

Watch Out For...

A deadly disease besieged executives across the country this year: Call it Sudden Reputation Death Syndrome. Early symptoms seemed innocuous enough--grumbling board members, mild cases of foot-in- mouth disease, stock falloffs. But once the disease took hold, no decision the afflicted executive made was the right one, and soon onetime People to Watch had become People to Watch Out For. 
Houston became a regular hot zone after Jeff Skilling, Ken Lay, and the rest of the Enron gang managed to turn a thriving New Age energy business into a pile of rubble between Labor Day and Thanksgiving.
Blustery Linda Wachner and Jacques Nasser fought long battles but fell victim to the illness when Wachner plunged Warnaco into bankruptcy and Nasser's missteps alienated the Ford family and caused his company's stock to lose another 30% on the year. Shailesh Mehta, who pursued an aggressive growth strategy at credit card provider Providian, took sick while watching the stock drop 94% during 2001 amid a wave of card defaults. All three lost their jobs. 
There's another possible case germinating at Hewlett-Packard-- that of Carly Fiorina. Whether the Compaq merger will push her into full arrest remains to be seen, but one thing's for sure: This drama is more action-packed than an episode of ER.

Enron Canada Corp To Assume New Form: CEO

01/07/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This article was originally published Friday) 

CALGARY -(Dow Jones)- The head of former marketing giant Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Canadian unit is a strong believer in reincarnation, at least if it's corporate.
Enron Canada Corp.'s profitability and pool of talent will keep it from sinking under the ashes of its parent company's fiery demise, President and Chief Executive Robson Milnthorp said Friday to Dow Jones Newswires. 
""There are a number of shapes that this can be resurrected under,"" Milnthorp said. ""That might entail being auctioned off through the parent in Houston, or replacing the Enron balance sheet with someone else's. 
""There's no reason to panic or jump at the first alternative,"" he said. 
The shaved-bald executive believes a new entity will appear on the Canada power market by midyear, under a different name but with many of Enron Canada's strengths. 
Enron Canada, which cornered approximately 40% of power trades in the country last year, tried unsuccessfully to distance itself from Enron Corp. when the global power trader lost investor status in November because of a number of dubious business deals. 
The Canadian unit argued it was financially stable, compared to its parent and credit guarantor, but was unable to stop the flood of contract terminations that followed Enron's filing for bankruptcy protection in early December. 
Milnthorp lost a court battle last month to keep counterparties from jumping ship, and has been liquidating company accounts since then to keep from becoming insolvent. 
The biggest move was the C$215 million sale of its power contract for the output of a 706-megawatt generation station in northcentral Alberta. 
Enron Canada lost $80 million on its original purchase price in the deal with TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. (T.TRP) and AltaGas Services Inc. that was completed last Friday when a U.S. bankruptcy judge approved the sale. 
The sale enabled Enron Canada to meet December settlements from November contracts, albeit three days late, on Dec. 28. 
Financial settlements due Jan. 5 will be met Friday, Jan. 4, Milnthorp said. 
Enron's fall from credit favor across the world has changed how natural gas producers look on contracts, said a Calgary analyst. 
""Credit is now No. 1 with producers,"" Ron Vogal, with Streamline Energy Group Ltd. said. ""We're telling all the little guys to align themselves with a number of marketers instead of just one, and some are looking at going back to dealing directly with the end-user, rather than through a marketer."" 
Most Canadian producers have liquidated their contracts with Enron Canada and are in the process of replacing the natural gas. Offset agreements, where amounts due are balanced against amounts owing for a net result, are taking place between producers and Enron Canada, Vogal said. 
A number of companies still owe the marketing firm. One company, IMC Canada Ltd., recently lost a court request to be released from its C$2.3 million debt to Enron Canada. 
Milnthorp anticipates more litigation to come through Canadian courtrooms as counterparties and Enron Canada sort out contract terminations and calculate damages.

A
Houston feels pain of Enron's collapse ; Insecurity is tempered by cockiness
Nathan Levy
SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON TIMES

(Copyright 2002)

HOUSTON - As the lunch-hour crowd shuffles by, Dave Glessner, a chemical engineer at Enron Corp., stands alone across the street from the company's glitzy headquarters. A box of his personal work belongings rests at his feet. 
He has bittersweet feelings about the energy trader that recently filed the largest bankruptcy petition in U.S. history. ""It was a great job, great company, great people,"" said Mr. Glessner, dressed casually in a short-sleeve shirt and olive-colored pants. He has worked at Enron for almost 11 years and will be dismissed in about a month.
""I just hope, if there was some criminal intent, that the people who caused this feel some real pain,"" referring to the legal punishment top management may receive for questionable accounting methods. 
The collapse of Enron's stock price - it's now selling for 65 cents a share, after it lost 99 percent of its value in the past year - has wiped out the savings of many retirees and investors. 
For example, Mr. Glessner's 401(k) company retirement plan has declined in value from $1 million to $5,000, but the pain for him and his colleagues runs deeper. 
""People's lives were disrupted,"" the unassuming 52-year-old said. ""It's everything from relationships to anxiety. People are feeling depressed."" 
Enron's release of 4,500 Houston employees, or 60 percent of its local work force, is just one event that has contributed to the insecure mood. 
A couple of other Houston-based public companies have had similar woes. Compaq Computer, hurt by sluggish PC sales, already has laid off at least 1,500 workers here and may fire more if Hewlett-Packard acquires the firm. Continental Airlines announced thousands of local job cuts after the September 11 terrorist attacks because of reduced air travel and increased security costs. 
Natural disaster struck, too, as flooding from Tropical Storm Allison caused $5 billion in damage and killed 22 persons in early June. 
Yet Houston remains cocky, even with a nationwide recession. The city has been adding about 50,000 jobs annually in recent years, though leaders expect 2002 employment growth will be about half of that number. 
""There is a quality in Houston of bravado, of risk taking, of dreaming big dreams and being prepared to fall on your face if they don't come true,"" said Stephen Klineberg, a sociology professor at Rice University. ""In some paradoxical sense, Enron falling on its face is a confirmation of that entrepreneurial spirit."" 
Mr. Glessner, the Enron engineer, said the company already had taught him to be prepared always to reinvent yourself. Not married, he intends to stay in Houston and is pursuing job leads in the natural gas business. 
""Change is a constant, and you have to keep current,"" he acknowledged. ""That's what I'm doing."" 
Oil once dominated Houston, with four out of five jobs tied directly or indirectly to the industry. When oil prices fell in the mid-1980s, the city unraveled. Work evaporated, downtown office space went vacant, and banks locked their doors for good. 
Houston diversified some in the 1990s and added jobs in such areas as technology, manufacturing and trade. Houston now also is home to a renowned medical center, the second-busiest port in the country, NASA's Johnson Space Center and a 17-block cultural district, replete with modern art centers, a theater hall and a Holocaust museum. 
But regardless, the nation's fourth-largest city still runs on energy, said John Young, a wildcatter who drills for oil and natural gas in central Texas and the onshore Gulf Coast region. ""It really is the world energy capital,"" he said. 
In this city known for its traffic jams and air pollution, energy firms even now compose 50 percent of the economy. Enron, formed by Chairman Ken Lay in 1985 as a gas pipeline business, sought to be a pioneer. The company expanded into energy trading in the 1990s, as it bought and sold natural gas and electric power in wholesale markets. 
Enron then branched out further and attempted to sell all sorts of goods on the Internet, from paper products to fiber-optic bandwidth. The company said it had sales of more than $100 billion in 2000, making it the seventh-largest U.S. company. 
At the tony Galleria Mall, shoppers are buying more cautiously after Enron's demise. ""It's all anyone's talking about at the Christmas parties,"" said Gayl Carlberg, who co-owns an advertising agency with her husband. 
Holding a small, red Neiman Marcus bag, she said her firm has had a record year in winning new business, though existing clients have cut back. As a result, the mother of two said she plans to spend less on holiday gifts this year than last year. 
Nevertheless, she's confident the city will bounce back. ""That's the thing about Houston and Texas. You can't knock us down,"" Mrs. Carlberg said. 
Mr. Young agreed, calling the Enron collapse just a ""speed bump"" for the home of 2 million residents and 21 Fortune 500 companies. 
Houston's swagger may have been ""downsized"" a bit, but the city remains upbeat, local Salomon Smith Barney stockbroker David Harris said. He didn't recommend Enron stock to his clients because it was overvalued, though he had no inkling about Enron's ruin. 
A Michigan native, Mr. Harris predicts Houston may face a fall in some residential real estate prices, and entertainment spending may decrease. The fiscal effects haven't filtered down yet, he said, though it might be like a ""Chinese water torture"" over the next several months. 
""We've learned a lot from the boom and subsequent bust of the '80s,"" said Mr. Harris, 45, who moved to Houston 16 years ago. ""The boom this time was far more subdued, and therefore, any downside will be much more modest."" 
The collapse of Enron has left other ripples in its wake. Enron had been a major benefactor to local charities, and city officials say the money will not be easily replaced. 
""It was profoundly philanthropic,"" said Peter Marzio, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. Enron's collapse ""will certainly have a short-term effect."" 
Of the $35.5 million corporations contributed to the museum from 1995 to 2000, about $1.7 million, or 5 percent, came from Enron, he said. 
Another Enron effect is the name of the 2-year-old downtown stadium where the Houston Astros baseball team plays. Enron agreed to pay the team $100 million over 30 years for the naming rights, though the future of the stadium's name is uncertain.

US Lindsey:Govt Response To Enron 'Tribute' To Capitalism

01/06/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Lawrence Lindsey, President George W. Bush's economic adviser, Sunday described as a ""tribute to American capitalism"" the U.S. government's decision not to intervene during the collapse of energy giant Enron Corp. 
Appearing on the Fox News Sunday program, Lindsey also confirmed that he worked briefly for Enron as a consultant providing macroeconomic analysis.
Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early December 2001 amid allegations of accounting irregularities that have prompted several investigations. 
""What I think is the story here that's going untold (is that) in no other country in the world would you have the seventh-largest company fail - Enron, with these alleged political connections - and the government would simply let it happen,"" Lindsey said. 
""This is a tribute to American capitalism, I believe, that we have a profit and loss economy; that If you make mistakes - and clearly mistakes were made by Enron - that the government is not going to step and save it. No one is proposing to do that,"" he said. 
Enron, Lindsey said, pursued a strategy common among major corporations by making financial contributions to both major political parties. Fox News reported the President's economic counselor received $50,000 from Enron in 2000, and Lindsey was asked at one point whether he might become the victim of a Republican version of ""Whitewater,"" referring to the investigations into the business dealings of former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
""I gave them (Enron) macroeconomic advice and if that's the case, so be it,"" he replied.

Texas powers up for deregulation ; Skeptics recall California debacle
Judith Graham, Tribune national correspondent

01/07/2002
Chicago Tribune
North Sports Final ; N
1
(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)

Last year gave a black eye to one of the great economic experiments of the late 1990s: deregulation of energy markets. Now energy-rich Texas is rolling out an ambitious deregulation plan, hoping to succeed where others, particularly California, have failed. 
The nation's second-most-populous state is the great hope for free- market advocates, who say that unfettered competition among power companies will lower prices and improve choices for businesses and consumers. But Texas faces many hurdles, including skeptical consumers.
Few can forget the panic early in 2001 that surrounded rolling blackouts in California, where deregulation failed spectacularly and cost the state billions of dollars in bailouts and other expenses. Pennsylvania, once held up as a model by free-market advocates, also fell upon hard times last year, as prices spiked and electricity companies exited the state. 
Texas-based Enron Inc., the most aggressive advocate of free energy markets in the United States, suffered a disastrous unraveling of fortunes at year's end and plunged into bankruptcy, with a record- setting $32 billion in debt. Feeling the need for greater caution, several states--Arkansas, Montana, Oklahoma, Oregon, Nevada, New Mexico and West Virginia among them -- have delayed or stopped plans to deregulate electricity. 
But Texas, with its customary swagger, promises that its new open- markets energy plan will prove the benefits of the free-market gospel. The plan went into effect last Tuesday, covering much of the state and as many as 4.5 million customers. 
""We're doing this right. We are not California,"" said Brett Perlman, a commissioner with the Texas Public Utility Commission, a regulatory agency. 
""We desperately need a good story,"" said Ken Malloy, president of The Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets, a pro-competition think tank based in Burke, Va. 
""If Texas fails, it will be a very, very hard blow, an even bigger disaster than California,"" Malloy warned. 
Supporters of deregulation argue California's experience was an aberration, not a symbol of what is wrong with policies they have proposed. By contrast, they say, the new energy plan in Texas is a model of careful and intelligent planning. 
""Texas has probably the best-thought-out system for deregulating electricity out there,"" said John O'Brien, the principal with Skipping Stone Inc., an energy consulting firm. 
""Beyond that, it's got a great deal of symbolic significance because it's a plan from an energy-rich state signed off on by then- governor, now president, Bush,"" he added. 
Enron's fall casts dread 
Enron's demise has cast a shadow on the endeavor. Not only was the Houston-based company one of the primary supporters of deregulation, but it also planned to compete in the power business through subsidiaries or companies in which it held a substantial ownership interest. 
Recently, Mario Max Yzaguirre, the chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission and a former Enron executive, has been embroiled in controversy because of previously undisclosed ties to the company. The commission was responsible for implementing the 1999 deregulation legislation. 
Illinois officials will be watching Texas with interest, as they prepare for the start-up of retail competition for electricity consumers, which begins in May. 
Like Illinois, Texas adopted a staged approach to deregulation. In 1995, the Lone Star State lifted monopolistic restraints on wholesale electricity markets, giving incentives for new power generators to come to the state. Since then, 39 power plants have been built, 20 have started construction and 29 more have been proposed. 
The result is an abundant supply of electricity for Texas, which meets its energy needs almost entirely from in-state production-- unlike California. Texas has a 23 percent cushion of excess supply over peak demand, well above the 15 percent cushion recommended by industry analysts. 
Even with the state's rapid population growth and its enormous appetite for energy, especially during the brutally hot summers, a similarly substantial cushion should hold for several years, said Terry Hadley, a spokesman for the Texas Public Utility Commission. 
""If California had the [supply] reserves that Texas has, the California crisis would have never occurred,"" O'Brien said, echoing a view expressed by several analysts. 
Others are not convinced. 
""In 1998, California believed there would be a glut of capacity, just like Texas does today,"" said Severin Borenstein, an economics professor with the University of California's Energy Institute. ""We learned that a glut can dry up quickly. And Texas doesn't seem to appreciate the ability of sellers in a tight market to exercise market power and jack up prices."" 
Plan gets a good mark 
One mark in its favor, analysts said, is that the Texas plan allows more pricing flexibility than California's. Twice a year, utilities can seek adjustments in rates, based on fluctuations in the cost of energy supplies such as natural gas. It will be several years before rates become entirely market-driven. 
Like other states, Texas had to sell its package politically by guaranteeing savings to consumers. 
By law, savings for existing utilities had to be at least 6 percent. But actual rate reductions this year will be between 11 percent and 17 percent, in large part because of lower natural gas prices. Only existing utilities' rates are regulated; new competitors can charge whatever they want. 
Several of the new companies entering Texas' electricity market have complained, arguing that rates are set too low to allow meaningful competition. The companies have asked: Why should consumers switch when they can get such a good deal from their existing electricity providers? 
""It's going to be very hard to turn a profit,"" said Marcie Zlotnik, president of GEXA Energy, one of the new entries. 
Consumer advocates fought hard to keep the low rates intact. 
""Our overall concern has been that consumers will not receive the promised benefits of competition,"" said Janee Briesemeister, senior policy analyst in the Austin office of Consumers Union. 
Texas has put in place several important consumer protections, she acknowledged, including prohibitions against switching customers without their knowledge. The law also requires that marketing information be standardized so people can make meaningful comparisons between plans. 
So far, competition on the residential side of the business does not appear robust. Although 41 companies have registered to enter the power business in Texas, only about five are marketing to households. The the business marketplace is seeing much more activity, said Gillan Taddune, president of the Texas region of Green Mountain Energy Co., which is touting its wind-powered product. 
""I'd like to see another major company enter the residential market,"" she said. 
Analysts look to June 
Texas officials say it may take several years before competition really takes hold. But some analysts think early indications of the state's progress with deregulation will come sooner. 
""By the time June or July rolls around, we'll be able to make some good initial judgments,"" O'Brien, the consultant with Skipping Stone. 
""I think the Texas plan will work. If it doesn't, I won't call that fatal, but it'll be very hard for our industry to recover,"" he said.

Texas Lets Consumers Pick Power Source As Other States Are Watching Experiment
By Kristen McNamara
Dow Jones Newswires

With meltdowns in California and Enron Corp. at either end, electricity deregulation may have had its worst year ever. But a number of states are nevertheless pushing ahead plans to open their markets to competition. 
Those moves are being led by Texas, which has planned to allow the vast majority of its consumers to choose their power provider as of yesterday -- a year after an electricity crisis threatened to plunge California into darkness and a month after Enron, once the country's largest trader of power and natural gas, filed for bankruptcy-law protection.
Texas' effort ranks as the country's second-largest experiment with deregulation -- right behind California's -- and will affect eight million consumers. How well competition takes hold there could influence deregulation plans in other states, energy experts agreed. ""I think everyone is watching Texas,"" said Sharon Reishus, associate director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a Massachusetts research firm. ""It certainly is the key to restoring people's confidence that retail energy has a future."" 
Michigan and Virginia also planned to launch full retail competition on New Year's Day. In May, all residential consumers in Illinois will have the opportunity to choose an alternate power supplier. 
But success in Texas won't necessarily translate into momentum in all regions. Lingering concerns over California's energy crisis may continue to stall deregulation plans in some states, some regulators and consumers advocates said. 
Deregulation will affect most consumers in Texas, those under the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or Ercot, which runs the power grid in all areas of the state except the Texas Panhandle and parts of the southeast and far west. 
Conditions in Texas bode well for competition to take root, Ercot and some analysts said. Power supplies are plentiful, wholesale electricity prices are low and the retail rates Texas utilities must initially charge their customers are high enough to give other service providers room to compete, Ms. Reishus said. 
Ercot ran a pilot program during the second half of 2001 under which 5% of customers in the region could switch providers and now says it is ready to open competition to all. 
Computer glitches that surfaced during the trial phase have been worked out, and Ercot successfully tested the centralized computer-registration system in late November, said Tom Noel, the grid operator's chief operating officer. ""We are very confident that everything is in excellent working order,"" he said. ""I expect the transition from Dec. 31 to Jan. 1 to be very much like Y2K. It will just come and go."" 
It is difficult to estimate how many customers will seek alternate providers, but the migration will likely be gradual, rather than a frantic rush to switch in the first few days of deregulation, Mr. Noel said. 
That has certainly been the case in other states, where even relatively successful efforts like Pennsylvania's have seen few residential customers willing to switch providers. Alternate suppliers in such states have complained they can't compete with the low rates state energy regulators have allowed incumbent utilities to offer. 
A successful transition in Texas could help move deregulation forward elsewhere, Ms. Reishus said. ""If it works there, we'll see some renewed optimism about the retail markets in general,"" she said. 
About half of the states in the union have deregulated their retail electricity markets or are in some stage of laying the groundwork. 
Though Texas is moving forward, some of its neighbors are having second thoughts. Arkansas and Oklahoma, along with a handful of other states, have sought to delay the start of competition, citing uncertainty about wholesale market development and the consequences for consumers. 
That uncertainty was generated by California, where a poorly designed market structure and tight supplies produced soaring power costs and rolling blackouts, and left the state's two largest utilities unable to pay their bills. The state of California, which contends energy companies took advantage of a lack of oversight to manipulate the market and boost prices, has become the primary procurer of power for millions of consumers. As such, it has signed $43 billion in power-supply contracts that consumers will be paying off for the next decade. 
Some of the 26 states that haven't passed deregulation laws, such as Wisconsin and Minnesota, have cited concerns about California-style problems as the reason for holding back.

Investigating Enron

NO SERIOUS scandal in Washington is investigated just once, and Enron's spectacular collapse is generating multiple inquiries. So far three House committees and two Senate committees are looking into the energy trading firm's demise; the Justice Department, the Labor Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are conducting three more postmortems. This hydra-headed inquisition is basically welcome, because Enron's bankruptcy raises many troubling issues. But its focus must remain on the regulatory failures that allowed the company to defraud shareholders and workers. Enron's links to the Bush administration, a tempting target for Democrat-controlled committees in the Senate, appear less salient for the moment. 
The regulatory failures begin with the auditing profession. Over the past four years, Enron's accounts overstated its real earnings by half a billion dollars. At the end of 2000 Enron reported debts of $10.2 billion; in its bankruptcy filing last month, it listed debts of almost $40 billion. This sort of deception is supposed to be prevented by a firm's outside auditor, whose job is to certify the accuracy of accounts. But Arthur Andersen, the auditor in this case, knowingly certified misleading financial statements. In 1997 Andersen identified $51 million of problems in Enron's books. It suggested that these should be put right. But when its advice was ignored, it went ahead and certified Enron's accounts anyway.
This may not be the first time that Andersen turned a blind eye to dishonesty. The Securities and Exchange Commission has alleged that the firm's partners saw problems at two other big clients, Sunbeam Corp. and Waste Management Inc. According to the SEC, Andersen decided that the problems could be overlooked because they were not ""material."" In the Waste Management case, the SEC accused Andersen of fraud and the firm agreed to a settlement involving a fine of $7 million. In light of this track record, it is not very comforting that another big auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, completed a peer review of Andersen on Wednesday and offered only minor criticisms of its operations. The whole edifice of self-regulation appears insufficiently robust. An important focus for Enron's inquisitors is to consider tougher oversight. 
The second focus ought to concern pensions. Enron's employees were encouraged to invest their 401(k) plans in Enron stock, which came to make up more than half the assets in the company's retirement system. Enron's collapse therefore left many of the 4,500 U.S. employees who were laid off pensionless as well as jobless. This ill-advised concentration of risk exists at many firms. One study of retirement plans at 219 firms found that a fifth bet more than half their wealth on the company's own stock. Last month Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Jon Corzine (D-N.J.) proposed legislation that would cap company stock at 20 percent of a retirement fund. Reform along these lines ought to be supported. 
Fixing audit and pension rules is a meaty challenge. But some Democrats seem tempted to play down these issues in favor of focusing on links between Enron and the Bush administration. Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, has been President Bush's leading financial backer; he was consulted when the administration was drawing up its energy plan. But, barring further disclosures, this looks more like an instance of the generalized corruption of campaign finance than a shadow over the Bush team. The truth is that Enron showered money on many politicians of both parties, and especially on Texans. If Democrats are outraged by this, they should push for campaign finance reform rather than attacking the administration.

Investigating Enron Corp. 
By RUBY
Sunday, January 6, 2002 
About the same time the Winter Olympics are gearing up in Salt Lake City, other games will be under way at a venue nearly a continent away. The collapse of Enron Corp., the giant energy and trading company, has sparked an investigative groundswell in Washington. This is as it should be: Enron's spectacular sinking spell has raised questions about the probity of financial reporting and auditing, the integrity of the company's top brass, whether ordinary employees were prevented from selling shares while officers were dumping theirs and the quality and quantity of government regulation. The war on terrorism is mandatory Job One for the U.S. government, but cleaning out the Enron sewer may be Job Two. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission is the lead government agency investigating Enron right now. The company was a Wall Street darling less than a year ago when its stock price was nearly $90 a share. But investor confidence imploded following stories of alleged insider partnerships and downgraded earnings forecasts. By the time Enron sought protection under bankruptcy laws, its stock had declined to less than $1 a share. It closed on Friday at 66 cents a share. In the process, thousands of employees invested in the company's stock through their 401(k) plans lost almost everything. 
Congress is investigating, too, with several committees or subcommittees planning hearings. To prevent a real circus, these congressional inquiries ought to be consolidated -- ideally, into a special joint committee of the House and Senate that would be co- chaired by members named by House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.). This joint committee would have the same subpoena powers as a standing committee, and its members obviously could seek guidance from outside experts. 
But the objective is to get to the bottom of the Enron debacle, find out what went wrong and whether individuals are culpable, and take prosecutorial action if appropriate. That objective will be better achieved if the effort is not scattered throughout the government.

INSIGHT

The 401(k) terrorists

The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
D.1
(Copyright 2002)

They were the secretaries and bookkeepers and engineers who brought their families to the company picnic every year and drank their morning coffee from company mugs. All the magazines said Enron was one of the best companies in America, so they squeezed 30,000 extra miles from the family car to put aside a bit of every paycheck to buy company stock. 
When the 401(k) statement arrived each month, they slept easier that night. Even when rumors surfaced that Enron was faltering, employees were assured it was media gossip.
Marie Thibaut, a 61-year-old executive assistant, had planned to retire from Enron at the end of 2002. She finally could help her exhausted father in Michigan care for her mother, who suffered from Alzheimer's. And she wanted to spend time with her four grandchildren. 
By August 2001, her 401(k) had grown to almost $500,000 -- enough with Social Security to provide a comfortable retirement and maybe leave a little something to her kids. 
Then, just like that, the money was gone, lost in the biggest bankruptcy in American history. 
""You can't believe it's happening,"" she said by phone from Houston the other day. ""It's like an out-of-body experience."" 
Of all the ideas and institutions we took for granted as recently as six months ago -- our electoral system, our national security, our civil liberties -- none has shaken the confidence of more Americans than the sudden and colossal collapse of that sure-thing, Wall- Street-darling Enron. 
Perhaps this sounds politically insensitive, but I fear the upper management of the companies that comprise my pension fund more than I fear the upper management of al Qaeda. The truth is, the cold indifference inside an American boardroom is more likely to cripple any one of us than the cold indifference inside an Afghan cave. 
The executives at Enron knew the company was in trouble as early as last spring. But chairman Ken Lay repeatedly assured employees their 401(k)s were safe, even as lawyers and accountants shuttled money among partnerships to keep the company afloat. 
In December, after reports had become public about inflated earnings, hidden losses and secret deals, Enron filed for bankruptcy, vaporizing what was once more than $50 billion of shareholders' wealth. But Lay, former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling and other insiders had already saved themselves. They had been cashing in millions of dollars' worth of shares at premium prices. 
The employees, however, were locked inside the sinking ship. Enron froze their 401(k) plans just when stock prices began to plummet to less than 60 cents a share. People like Marie Thibaut watched helplessly, prohibited from withdrawing their money until it was too late. They also watched, in horror and disbelief, as Enron distributed more than $100 million in bonuses to a select group of executives and other employees. 
Thibaut's savings has now dwindled to about $22,000. And she has been laid off, leaving Enron with just $4,500 in severance pay for 15 years of service. 
""We believed in our company. We believed in Ken Lay. He kept telling us not to worry, that everything was OK,"" Thibaut said. ""I hope these people go to jail."" 
On Monday, she will start a new job with Shell Oil at a lower salary, and she feels lucky to have it. She will begin to build a new pension account. She has to keep working for at least another five years to become vested. 
Ken Lay and his colleagues will move on, too. One imagines they'll play 18 at Kapalua during Easter week and dig a pond at the ranch for summer fishing and land at another corporation with cappuccino in the executive kitchen. 
American law doesn't define what these men have done as terrorism. So they do not qualify for trial in front of a tribunal to account for the pain and fear they've spread. 
I propose we make an exception.

Interview: Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman discuss the war in Afghanistan and the US economy

Excerpt Only
MR. RUSSERT: And we are back and joined by Senators Joe Lieberman and John McCain. They're heading for Afghanistan and Pakistan this morning, are in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Senator McCain, you just heard Mr. Karzai talk about the frustration of trying to find Mohammad Omar. Are you confident that we will take him into custody eventually? 
**********************************************
MR. RUSSERT: Senator McCain, and, Senator Lieberman--let me start with Senator McCain first--how serious do you think the investigation into the collapse of Enron is for the Bush administration? 
SEN. McCAIN: I don't know, because we've just begun the investigation, but there sure was a lot of money washing around. And I'll be very interested to see what we find out. And, clearly, I don't understand some of the machinations that took place that allowed executives to make millions of dollars while the shareholders are left holding the bag. 
MR. RUSSERT: Senator Lieberman, how serious is the Enron investigation? 
SEN. LIEBERMAN: Well, the Enron investigation is very serious. The focus of it is not in the first instance on a connection between anybody in the Bush administration and the folks at Enron, but, you know, to do a thorough investigation, you've got to ask that question, certainly, down the road. And the question that we're going to ask on our committee is: Where were the oversight agencies of the federal government? Could they have done more? And what about the auditors and outside directors of Enron? And what about these strange offshore entities, partnerships that were created by executives of Enron, which traded with the company, in some cases seeming to create a market, that then drew average Americans to put their money into the company and lose an awful lot of it? 
So this is an unprecedented event. The largest bankruptcy in American history. And unless we look at it thoroughly and ask all the questions, the danger is it's going to happen again and a lot more average folks are going to lose a lot of hard-earned money. 
MR. RUSSERT: Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman, Republican Senator John McCain. And we'll be right back.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
Excerpt Only
************************************
HUNT: Senator Breaux, Enron, as you know, only months ago, one of the highest values companies in America, has gone bankrupt, top executives that walked away with millions from the sweetheart deals, while thousands of workers have lost their pensions. A lot of talk about the identification with George Bush and the Republican Party. They also have contributed to a number of Democrats. I think you were the 11th-largest Senate recipient of Enron funds over the last 12 years. They had street fair for you at a previous Democratic convention. 
As you look at that company now, do you think Enron was merely a victim of an economic downturn or do you think it was an ethical and perhaps even criminal scam? 
BREAUX: It wasn't a street fair; that was a Mardi Gras party, in the finest New Orleans tradition. 
HUNT: I stand corrected. 
BREAUX: The Enron thing is a mess and I think that it's going to be properly looked at at the very highest level. It's already been investigated by a number of congressional committees, and they should look into it. I think that some of the activities of some of the leaders of that corporation right before it tanked is absolutely unacceptable. 
I mean, it was obvious to me that somebody knew what they were doing by bailing out of the company, while they were in leadership positions. The people who were hurt the most were the individuals or the every-day working guy and lady who had their lifetime savings invested in their stock. And there were some terrible things -- wrong things that were done. And I think it's going to come out. 
HUNT: One thing that is alleged is that Ken Lay, the former CEO, and the company had an enormous amount of influence in helping Dick Cheney put together the Bush energy package, reportedly even some veto power over some measures. 
Do you think that all ought to be revealed? Should Vice President Cheney have to tell the American public and the Congress what role Ken Lay and Enron played in formulating the Bush-Cheney energy policy? 
BREAUX: Whether he should or shouldn't, I think he's probably going to have to. I think the political situation, I think, is going to require that they pretty much divulge everybody that, perhaps, they talked to and got recommendations. 
I want to say, however, I have no problems talking to energy companies about getting recommendations on energy. I mean, what do you do? Talk to people who know nothing about the problem, and then listen to what they have to say? 
I think you have to go to people that know something about the process and know something about developing energy to develop an energy policy. So I have no problems with the fact that they consulted with people in the business. I think they should have. 
But I think also, they're going to have to say that and have to disclose it now.

Kenneth Lay should be in the spotlight on the Enron scandal [""Enron Executives Face Subpoenas,"" Business, Jan. 3]. As head of Enron, he is ultimately answerable and culpable. No one should take a fall for him. He exploited shareholders. He deceived analysts, suppliers and customers. He gamed the system and took, unfairly, all the personal wealth he could. He cost many employees their jobs through predatory and poor fiscal judgment. Maybe we should start a category labeled business terrorists.

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

Enron Probe
2002-01-30 15:18 (New York)

   By Kathy Chu 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The results of an internal investigation into Enron
Corp.'s (ENRNQ) collapse may be released early next week, a company lawyer said
Wednesday. 
  The report will be posted online, at the Web site of the  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court of the Southern District of New York.
The report is the culmination of Enron's three-month effort to account for
off-balance sheet partnerships that the company used to keep debt off its books
and to maintain a healthy credit rating. 
  The transactions led the company last November to write down $1.2 billion of
shareholder equity and to restate four years worth of earnings. 
  Enron formed the special task force in October, hoping to restore investors'
confidence in an energy-trading company that had begun to falter. 
  The committee is made up of outside directors led by William Powers Jr., dean
of the University of Texas law school. William McLucas - former head of the
Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division and a partner at the
Washington, D.C., law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering - represents the task force.
  McLucas didn't return phone calls seeking comment, and Powers couldn't
immediately be reached for comment.
The committee served as a liaison between Enron and the SEC, which launched
its own investigation into the company's  accounting practices last year. 
  Deloitte & Touche serves as the task force's independent  accountant. 
  The results of the investigation are expected to shed more light into the
complex books of a company that had more  than 3,500 units and numerous
off-balance sheet partnerships. 
  Edward Ketz, an associate professor of accounting at Penn State's Smeal
College of Business, said that it's unlikely that more significant surprises
will come out of the report. 
  But, he said, ""if there's any further bombshell, the real damage will be done
with the accounting profession itself. It may give greater weight for Congress
to do something (about accounting guidelines).""
News of the internal report's release came during a hearing before Judge
Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New
York. 
  Wednesday, Gonzalez approved the retention of two law firms, Weil Gotshal &
Manges and Togut Segal & Segal, as attorneys for the debtor. 
  In doing so, the judge overruled an objection by Enron creditor Wiser Oil Co.
(WZR), which is owed about $7 million  in trade debt, asking that a separate
legal team be appointed for Enron's core unit, Enron North America. This
subsidiary includes the wholesale energy-trading operations,  which generated
90% of the company's $101 billion in revenue last year. 
  Gonzalez noted that the creditor's concerns - one being that funds from the
Enron North America unit will be used to  benefit other subsidiaries - are
likely to be addressed in the next month, at court hearings to consider motions
for a trustee, examiner and a new cash-management system. 
  The bankruptcy court, earlier this week, approved Milbank Tweed as the law
firm for Enron's official creditors  committee, after no objections were filed.
Also Wednesday, Judge Gonzalez disclosed that his wife is part of a New York
City pension fund involved in Houston litigation against Enron. But he said
this doesn't disqualify him from presiding over the Enron case. 
  ""The court has examined and does not believe that my partiality will be
compromised,"" said Gonzalez. 
  When New York City pension matters are brought before the court, Gonzalez
will ""take steps"" to ensure that no conflicts of interest exist, he said. 
  The New York City pension funds along with the Florida State Board of
Administration have asked the bankruptcy court to enter a detailed order
requiring Enron to preserve its books and records. The hearing is set for Feb.
5. 
  The city and state pension funds are seeking the role of  co-lead plaintiffs
in class-action lawsuits filed against Enron in Texas, claiming securities
violations and fraud by company executives. 
  In total, the New York City pension funds claim a loss of $109 million from
Enron-related investments, while the Florida State Board claims losses of $334
million. 
  The New York City pension funds made up about 20% of his  wife's retirement
fund, said Gonzalez.

Ex-Enron Workers Plead With Congress For Financial Help

01/30/2002

WASHINGTON (AP)--Laid-off Enron (ENRNQ) workers pressed for help Wednesday on Capitol Hill, putting faces to some of the stories of retirement nest eggs lost when the company collapsed. 
Organized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, several dozen workers piled in buses to make the 25-hour trip from Houston to appeal for help paying for mortgages, health care, groceries, children's tuition and other living expenses.
""I lost everything, because I believed in Enron,"" Jessie Patterson told House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo, and other Democratic lawmakers. Earlier, the workers met with AFL-CIO officials. 
Gephardt pledged Democrats' help to assuage ""this ... tragedy of great proportions."" 
He said Enron's implosion, the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, should spur changes in laws governing pension and 401(k) plans that would give people more control over investments and greater protection against corporate mismanagement. 
Enron's generous political donations and attempts to influence energy policy also should also spark congressional passage of long-stalled legislation aimed at reducing the influence of big money in politics, Gephardt said. 
""I believe with all my heart that we have to clean up politics in this country,"" he said. 
Gwen Gray, who worked in Enron human resources, said she processed millions of dollars in bonuses that were paid to retain key executives in the two months leading up to the bankruptcy, while workers were given 30 minutes to get out of the building without severance pay. 
Almost 95% of Gray's 401(k) was invested in company stock. She said she has $109 left, ""and that will pay my light bill that's due Monday."" 
Several workers said they were having difficulty finding work because companies in the Houston area have been reluctant to hire Enron workers. Many feared that speaking out would hurt job prospects or target them for retaliation. 
""We're not here just for a handout,"" said Kathy Benedict, who can't afford the $300 a month to extend her health insurance benefits. ""We need jobs."" 
Several workers said lawmakers should change federal bankruptcy laws to make workers and their retirement plans secured creditors that would be at the top of the list for available assets. Workers now come after secured creditors. 
""Maybe it's too late for us, but there are other people out there,"" said Dennis Vegas. ""This could happen to other Americans.""

Former Enron Employee Warned Lay of Energy Contract Losses
2002-01-30 16:00 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 30 (Bloomberg) -- A former Enron Corp. manager warned then-Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in August that the company was hiding at least $500 million in losses on energy contracts, adding to evidence that senior executives knew about the company's growing debt, U.S. lawmakers said.
     Enron Energy Services, the unit that advised businesses and property owners on energy use and operated heating, lighting and air conditioning equipment on their behalf, ""had been doing deals for two years and was losing money on almost all the deals they booked,'' Margaret Ceconi, a former EES manager, wrote to Lay in an Aug. 29 e-mail. ""They are trying to cover up their dumb decisions.''
     Representatives Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House commerce committee, and John Dingell, the panel's senior Democrat, included a copy of the e-mail in a letter to Lay asking him whether he responded to Ceconi and or discussed her allegations with Enron's accounting and legal departments.
     The commerce committee is one of 10 congressional panels investigating Enron's collapse. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission also are looking into what led Enron, whose stock rose as high as $82 a share last year, to file the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2. Lawmakers have predicted that changes in the law and criminal indictments would result from the probes.
     Ceconi's e-mail echoed one sent by Sherron Watkins, an Enron vice president, in mid-August to Lay. In that note, Watkins said that said former Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling had ignored warnings from other company executives about conflicts of interest in partnerships the company created to hide the size of its debt.
     ""One can only surmise that the removal of Jeff Skilling was an action taken by the board to correct the wrong doings of the various management teams at Enron,'' Ceconi wrote.
     Skilling quit Enron last August and Lay returned to the job. Lay resigned last week as chief executive.
     One area investigators are looking into is whether executives of Enron, once the largest energy trader, misled shareholders and employees before it restated earnings in November.

Former Enron Employee Told Lay Earnings Misrepresented
By Bryan Lee

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Kenneth Lay, the former chairman and chief executive at Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), received at least two warnings last August that questionable - and potentially illegal - accounting practices would become the company's financial undoing.
Both memos warned that skepticism and increasing scrutiny in the wake of the surprise resignation that month of Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling would bring the company's financial plight to light. 
The first, now widely reported, came from Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, and discussed the various off-the-books transactions the company had engaged in, which ultimately contributed to the company's financial undoing later in the year. 
""I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals,"" Watkins wrote prophetically. 
Now congressional investigators have released another memo, sent to Lay on Aug. 29 via e-mail, from a recently laid-off employee who worked in sales for nine months at Enron Energy Services. 
Margaret Ceconi, who had been recruited from GE Capital (GE), asked her e-mail be forwarded to Enron's board, warning, ""The house of cards (is) falling."" 
Democratic staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee released the e-mail Wednesday, with Lay being scheduled to testify Monday before both the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee. 
Ceconi's e-mail goes into some detail about huge losses stemming from a number of retail electricity deals with commercial customers, and complains she was ""fraudulently"" recruited to the company. 
The e-mail ticks off a number of money-losing deals, and warns of potential Securities and Exchange Commission violations for ""knowingly misrepresent(ing) EES's earnings"" by hiding the losses in Enron's profitable wholesale electricity business. 
Ceconi warned the losses would add up to more than $500 million. ""Rumor on the 7th floor is that it is closer to $1 billion,"" she wrote. 
""But somehow EES, to everyone's amazement, reported earnings for the 2nd quarter,"" she continued, warning of accounting standards violations. 
That EES misrepresented its earnings ""is common knowledge among all the EES employees, and is actually joked about. But it should be taken seriously,"" Ceconi warned, citing industry analysts who ""know what's going on, they just can't confirm it. YET.""

Ex-Enron Employees Ask Democrats for Secured Creditor Status
2002-01-30 16:33 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Corp. employees today asked lawmakers to give them the same status as secured creditors in the company's bankruptcy and a bailout like the one the ailing airline industry received after Sept. 11.
     ""If I was a flood victim, the Red Cross would have been at my door the next morning,'' said Deborah Johnson, an ex-employee. ""We want relief.''
     About a dozen former Enron staffers from Houston went to the Capitol to meet with House Democrats today on a trip sponsored by the AFL-CIO federation of labor unions and the Reverend Jesse Jackson, chairman of the Rainbow-PUSH Coalition.
     The fired employees said they were frustrated that retention bonuses were granted to executives days before Enron filed for bankruptcy, while they can't cash their $4,500 severance checks because that money is tied up in bankruptcy court.
     ``They got bounced $4,500 checks and executives get a sound $100 million check the day before,'' Jackson said.
     As unsecured creditors, many Enron employees will receive money they're owed by the company only after secured creditors are paid.
     Shareholders are suing Enron, once the world's No. 1 energy trader, claiming that the company and its accountants hid some $600 million in losses from investors, triggering the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history.
     Representative Shelia Jackson Lee, a Democrat from Houston, called for hearings to examine bankruptcy laws during an informal meeting with the employees.
     ""The bankruptcy court closed the door on your severance,'' said Jackson Lee, adding that House hearings would look into ways Enron could be forced to set aside money for employees before it continues its restructuring.

Not Forthcoming

     The employees also asked for legislation to give them the same status as secured creditors in the bankruptcy case and said they're seeking the same sort of bailout that lawmakers gave the ailing airline industry following Sept. 11.
     Many of the employees blamed Enron executives for not being forthcoming about the company's financial situation.
     ""I've lost my job, I've lost the money I contributed to the 401k plan, and I had stock options I did not exercise,'' because company officials predicted the stock value would rise, said Monique VanVooren-Shankel, a former Enron employee. ""It evaporated.''
     A handful of Texas Democrats at a press conference with House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri and the fired workers vowed to push legislation that would give employees higher status in bankruptcy cases.
     ""The current bankruptcy code doesn't provide secured creditor status for 401k participants, and that needs to change,'' said Representative Ken Bentsen. Bentsen's bill would place 401k plan participants at the top of the list of unsecured creditors in the event of a bankruptcy where the plan fiduciary misled investors.
     Bentsen and Jackson Lee, along with 43 percent of the rest of the House, received contributions from Enron.

USA: New Enron president no stranger to corporate storms.
By Dan Wilchins

01/30/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Jeff McMahon, promoted Tuesday to president and chief operating officer at scandal-wracked Enron Corp. , has a knack for finding himself in the middle of corporate maelstroms. 
His ability to deal with trouble in a straight-shooting style was likely attractive to a company desperately needing some truth serum.
McMahon is said to have openly questioned some of the major off-balance sheet partnerships set up by Enron that contributed to the energy giant filing the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history in December. 
As a company insider, he understands the inner workings of Enron's complex dealings. That asset could help Enron in its survival strategy. But it could also prove to be a liability, if inquiries about off-balance sheet structures raise concerns about McMahon's involvement. 
The boyish-faced McMahon, a trained accountant known for his political savvy and strong sales ability, has held a number of senior roles at Enron, including executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp., and president and chief executive officer of Enron Industrial Markets. 
Enron isn't the first place in which McMahon, 41, has found himself at the center of a major corporate controversy. 
A decade ago, he was a young internal auditor caught up in a case that gained almost as much notoriety as Enron, as trading losses at his former employer, the U.S. subsidiary of German industrial giant Metallgesellschaft AG, nearly bankrupted the parent company. 
A HEDGE GONE AWRY 
In the early 1990s, McMahon was an internal auditor at the U.S. unit of Metallgesellschaft, MG Corp., which eventually lost more than $1 billion from oil futures trading, making headlines throughout the world. 
He wrote a series of internal audit reports critical of risk management and accounting procedures at the MG Corp. subsidiary responsible for the losses, MG Refining and Marketing, Inc. (MGR&M). 
""(McMahon) was one of the heroes at MG Corp.,"" said Bob Bernstein, a lawyer at Kaye Scholer LLP in New York, who represents Metallgesellschaft, now known as mg Technologies . 
Figuring out exactly what went wrong at MG Corp. is a cottage industry. The case is studied in business schools, and many former employees of the company and some academics insist that in the long-term, the MG trading strategy would have made money. 
MG Corp. was caught out in a trading strategy that amounted to a huge bet on oil futures prices. When oil prices dropped in 1993, the futures positions hemorrhaged cash, threatening the collapse of the entire company. 
""They were involved in giant speculation,"" said Jeff Parsons, an economist at Charles River Associates in Boston, who has studied MG Corp. The oil futures were meant to hedge longer-term supply contracts, but also provide a source of profit. 
RAISING RED FLAGS 
Internal audit reports obtained by Reuters indicate that McMahon's audit team was sounding alarms even before MG Corp. began hemorrhaging cash, and continued to do so as the problems persisted. 
An audit of risk management procedures at MGR&M dated August 27, 1993, found that risk management ""require(d) improvement,"" The amount of risk capital committed to the trading was ""much larger than anticipated in the original business plan,"" according to the report. 
Although the internal audit team was told that the Board of Directors had approved changes to the business plan, there was no formal written approval of the changes, the report continued. 
""The lack of formal approval presents the risk that deviations from the approved plan occur, go undetected, and expose the Company to financial loss,"" McMahon's report said. 
Management at the time ignored him, but after the losses were sustained, new management was brought in, saw McMahon's reports, considered additional evidence, and fired the architects of the strategy, Kaye Scholer's Bernstein said. 
MG managed through the crisis and continued to operate, though with significant help from bankers in a major bailout operation. 
A SIMILAR ROLE 
At Enron, McMahon may have played a role similar to that at MG Corp. 
According to a letter sent from Sherron Watkins, a vice president at Enron, to former Chairman Kenneth Lay, which was written after Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling resigned in August, McMahon was highly concerned about the off-balance sheet LJM partnerships, a series of deals set up by Enron. 
McMahon, then Enron's treasurer, demanded that five issues regarding LJM be addressed, if he was to remain in that position, Watkins said. Three days later, Skilling offered him the chief executive officer spot at Enron Industrial Markets, the letter said. 
For his part, Skilling has said that McMahon did raise concerns - but his primary issue was the impact of LJM on his compensation, according to Judy Leon, a spokeswoman for Skilling in Washington, D.C. 
OFF-BALANCE SHEET DEALS MAY PROVE NETTLESOME 
McMahon reports to Stephen Cooper, who on Tuesday was named acting chief executive. 
This joins Cooper, an outsider with a restructuring background, with McMahon, an insider not implicated directly in any wrongdoing. Still, McMahon was a senior financial official while a series of off-balance-sheet transactions were structured, and many of them had cross investments in one another, a banker who knows McMahon said. 
McMahon has so far successfully avoided criticism for his involvement with off-balance sheet structures, the banker said. ""But who knows if he'll get dragged into this?,"" he added.

Enron Energy Services To Surrender Illinois License
By Jon Kamp

01/30/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Energy Services is voluntarily giving up its certificate to serve commercial and industrial customers in Illinois, once a key growth area for the Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) unit, a spokeswoman confirmed Wednesday.
The Illinois Commerce Commission decided Tuesday to revoke the retail electric provider certificate held by Enron Energy Services, because its parent's debt rating is below investment grade. Though EES could fight the order, it doesn't plan to, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. 
""It became clear that we weren't going to be able to keep our license because of the debt rating,"" she said. 
EES is now facing similar issues in other states, including Texas and California, where it has a particularly large presence, Mahoney said. While it is fighting to keep customers in other areas, the clear financial benchmarks required for suppliers in Illinois leave EES with few options, she said. 
Mahoney was unable to list the number of customers EES had in Illinois, but the company was establishing a strong foothold in Chicago before it joined Enron in bankruptcy court in December. EES signed its first Chicago-area energy management deal with the Archdiocese of Chicago in 1998, then added other high-profile customers like the City of Chicago and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) unit Quaker Oats Co., among many others. 
EES had aggressive growth plans in the region. In an early October interview, before Enron's troubles became widely known, EES Chief Operating Officer Jeremy Blachman said Enron planned to build its share of the Chicago energy sales market to 8% to 10% from less than 1%. Chicago accounts for the lion's share of the $6 billion to $8 billion Illinois market. 
Now, the company is quietly moving in the opposite direction, trimming its profile in Illinois. The City of Chicago, Quaker and the Archdiocese have all recently walked away from their contracts with EES. In early January, a New York bankruptcy judge approved Enron's request to terminate many other Chicago-area deals, Mahoney said. 
Nationwide, EES received the power it needed to fulfill contracts from Enron's wholesale unit. Once Enron all but ceased power trading, EES was left to scramble for power from other suppliers. To date, it has managed to keep most of its 32,000 contracts while it tries to figure out how to restructure and maintain service, Mahoney said. 
But EES wasn't actually supplying Illinois customers with power. Instead, it was serving primarily as a billing agent, helping its Illinois clients manage their power needs, Mahoney said. It's still unclear whether EES needs its state certificate to serve as a billing agent, ICC Commissioner Ruth Kretschmer said Tuesday. 
Regardless, the company may not want to continue those operations, Mahoney said. EES was waiting for Illinois' young competitive retail market to mature before it signed actual deals to supply energy, using its billing-agent business to get its foot in the door. 
""We were in the process of putting in place the ability for us to supply physically,"" Mahoney said. ""We had thought that was imminent."" 
Now, Enron must decide whether it is still worth maintaining billing-agent and energy-management deals in Illinois when there is no possibility they will evolve into energy-supply contracts, Mahoney said. EES could also apply for a new supplier certificate in the future. 
""That's exactly what we're reviewing right now,"" Mahoney said. ""It's unclear what we will ultimately do in Illinois.""

USA: UPDATE 1-Probe needed into Enron's California deals-FERC.
By Chris Baltimore

01/30/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said Wednesday that the agency should investigate whether bankrupt Enron Corp. manipulated wholesale electricity prices in California. 
Enron, accused by Western politicians of raising prices in long-term supply contracts following California's power crisis, has denied any wrongdoing.
""We need to clear up that lingering doubt,"" said FERC commissioner Nora Brownell, a Republican appointee to the agency last summer. ""If there was market manipulation, we need to find it and we need to deal with it."" 
Brownell, speaking to reporters after a routine FERC meeting, made her comments after FERC Chairman Pat Wood testified on Tuesday before the Senate Energy Committee about Enron's impact on U.S. energy markets. Wood indicated during the hearing a willingness to open an agency investigation of Enron at the request of West Coast politicians. 
Enron supported Brownell's appointment to FERC because she was a free market advocate while a member of the Pennsylvania public utilities commission. 
The Houston-based company was among several independent power producers that enjoyed big increases in revenues early last year after Western spot market prices for wholesale power soared tenfold, to as high as $400 per megawatt hour. 
The electricity crisis was linked to California's failed deregulation scheme that did not encourage new plant construction and barred the state's utilities from passing through higher wholesale prices to consumers. 
The state eventually signed long-term supply contracts for some $42 billion worth of wholesale power supplies during coming years. Those contracts have been criticized by activist groups and some politicians as locking in prices well above market levels. 
ALLEGED OVERCHARGES 
Still pending before a FERC administrative judge is California's demand for some $9 billion in alleged overcharges by Enron and a dozen other wholesale suppliers. That case is unlikely to be determined for several more months. 
Brownell was noncommittal on what action FERC should take if any market manipulation was found to have occurred with Enron's sales into California. 
""I think there are tools we have to deal with the conclusion that someone manipulated the market,"" Brownell said. So far, there is no price data to show Enron did anything wrong, she said. 
""We need to get to the underlying facts of the case,"" she added. 
FERC has not officially opened an investigation yet but is expecting a formal request from Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Maria Cantwell of Washington, an agency spokesman said. 
Enron is accused of raising electricity prices in long-term supply contracts negotiated with the state of California following its power crisis. 
Data presented at the Senate panel's Tuesday hearing by an independent power market analyst showed West Coast forward prices for wholesale power plunged by 30 percent on Dec. 3, the day after Enron declared the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
Some Western senators said the data indicated Enron had inflated power prices before its bankruptcy. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said he wanted to ""lift the veil of secrecy"" around Enron's wholesale power transactions in the West.

GAO to Sue White House for Energy Task Force Records

Wednesday, January 30, 2002
FOX News
WASHINGTON - In an unprecedented move, the General Accounting Office will sue the White House for access to Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force records, Fox News has learned.
Unless the ""GAO gets the information they want or is in good faith negotiations, we're headed for court"" a GAO official told Fox News on Wednesday.
The official said that in recent GAO discussions with congressional investigators, it has been ""clear the White House is telling their side of the story, significantly misrepresenting certain facts""
GAO officials were calling congressional leaders at the Capitol Wednesday morning to tell them of the decision. An official announcement explaining the GAO's reasoning was expected after noon. 
It will be the first time in the GAO's 80-year existence that it has sued the executive branch. The process of filing the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington is expected to take two to four weeks. 
A decision had been expected from GAO Comptroller General David Walker, leader of Congress's investigative arm, all week. The GAO wants to force Cheney, who ran the task force, to turn over documents on the meetings held last year with business executives as the Bush administration crafted a new national energy policy. 
Some of the meetings included officials from the now-collapsed Enron Corp., a Houston-based energy broker with deep ties to Bush. 
Although lawyers for the White House and the agency had continued talks this week, Cheney said on Sunday that the dispute ""probably will get resolved in court."" 
In resisting the GAO, Cheney insists that providing the list of industry executives would harm his ability to receive advice in the future, and that the congressional investigators are overstepping their bounds. The GAO, as a congressional agency, insists it has the authority to request the information. 
Any GAO lawsuit would be highly controversial on Capitol Hill. The agency's investigation began after Democrats on April 19 requested that the GAO investigate the conduct, operations and funding of the Cheney energy task force. 
On Tuesday, some Republicans had threatened to try to block the suit. 
""I think it may come to that,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
Congress' investigative arm shouldn't be ""trying to impose disclosure on internal White House meetings to determine policy,"" Hatch said. ""If you have to do that, pretty soon there wouldn't be any meetings."" 
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said he and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., planned to ""talk to the agency."" 
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he was researching to see whether the GAO would be overstepping its authority by taking on the administration. 
""My concerns are that it would encroach upon the deliberative process and make it impossible for the vice president at the direction of the president to make a recommendation,"" Specter said. ""It's also a tricky area on executive privilege."" 
The San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that then-Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay gave Cheney a three-page document last April detailing the energy trading company's arguments against price caps or other measures to stabilize electricity prices in California. 
""Events in California and in other parts of the country demonstrated that the benefits of competition have yet to be realized and have not reached consumers,"" the memo said. 
The newspaper said some of the positions included in the memo were included in Cheney's energy plan. 
An Enron spokesman told the newspaper that Lay gave the memo to Cheney. Mary Matalin, an adviser to Cheney, said the energy plan included input from many sources. 
On Tuesday, an energy consultant suggested to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that Enron may have been using largely secret trades to manipulate energy markets. 
Robert McCullough, a consultant whose clients include several Northwest utilities, testified that in the week after Enron announced its bankruptcy, the ""forward price"" of electricity in the West fell sharply. Enron had been a key trader in this market, which is used as a hedge against future power price changes and is unregulated. 
""That certainly raises the question about whether Enron was manipulating the West Coast market"" by keeping prices artificially high, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in response to the consultant's testimony. 
McCullough said ""the clear implication is that Enron may have been using its market dominance to set forward prices."" 
Other energy experts said other reasons may have been behind the price decline. Lawrence Makovich, a power industry expert at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said it would be impossible to determine simply from the decline in price whether prices were manipulated. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission told the Senate panel it would investigate Enron's influence on wholesale electricity prices. 
The Associated Press contributed to this report.

White House Confirms Lay Memo But Hasn't Seen Lawsuit

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON (AP)--The White House said Wednesday it hadn't received notification of the lawsuit to be filed by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. 
A congressional source said Wednesday that GAO has decided to sue the White House for access to documents from President George W. Bush's energy task force.
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, ""The president will stand on principle and for the right of presidents and this president to receive candid advice without it being turned into a news release."" 
GAO officials were calling congressional leaders Wednesday to tell them of the decision. An official announcement was expected later in the day. 
The White House also said Kenneth Lay, then chairman of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), gave Vice President Dick Cheney a three-page document in April arguing for federal authorities to refrain from imposing price caps or other measures sought by California officials to stabilize electricity prices. 
""Events in California and in other parts of the country demonstrated that the benefits of competition have yet to be realized and have not reached consumers,"" the memo said. 
Cheney spokeswoman Mary Matalin dismissed the significance of the memo first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. Nine of Lay's 11 suggestions weren't included in the White House energy plan - and the two that made the report were non-controversial, she said. 
A decision had been expected all week from Comptroller General David Walker, GAO's chief. The GAO wants to force Cheney, who ran the energy task force, to turn over documents on the meetings held last year with business executives as the Bush administration crafted a national energy policy. 
Some of the meetings included officials from the now-collapsed Enron, whose executives have had deep ties to Bush.

Enron collapse memo details Cheney-Enron links

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - A memo outlining discussions between Enron officials and the White House reveals the extent to which the Houston energy giant lobbied to influence government policy, despite White House insistence that the details remain secret. 
The memo was given by former Enron Chairman Ken Lay to Vice President Dick Cheney last April when the two met to discuss the administration's response to California's energy crisis, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday.
The White House said Tuesday that aspects of the memo resembled elements of Cheney's energy plan, but refused to say whether the document was included in notes that Cheney now refuses to divulge to congressional investigators. 
The memo contains eight points spelling out Enron's case for why federal authorities should refrain from imposing price caps or other measures sought by California officials to stabilize runaway electricity prices. 
The key point for California was whether soaring wholesale power prices should be limited or whether such prices were just a reflection of normal supply-and-demand dynamics. 
The memo blames California officials for having made only ""limited progress"" in tackling the state's power woes. 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said it was no surprise that Enron had a voice in the formation of the Bush administration's stance on California's difficulties. 
""What the federal government did during the energy crisis was pretend that the problem didn't exist and say that the markets can solve everything, and that's the same thing Ken Lay told the governor,"" Maviglio told The Chronicle.

Judge Delays Ruling On Halting Enron Suits In Texas Crts

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- A U.S. district court judge delayed ruling Wednesday on a motion to stop plaintiffs from filing lawsuits in Texas state courts against Arthur Andersen L.L.P.; some of its employees and former executives of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ).
Plaintiff and defense attorneys involved in federal class-action lawsuits in the Southern District of Texas related to the collapse of Enron argued against allowing such cases to proceed, saying they violated the spirit of federal law governing securities law and could interfere with their own suits. 
Lawsuits have been filed in state courts in both Washington and Brazos counties in Texas on behalf of individual investors who lost money as a result of the collapse of Enron. Those suits name as defendants Andersen, four current Andersen employees, one former Andersen employee, and three former Enron executives. 
The cases filed in state courts are intended to circumvent federal securities laws, said Bruce Collins, an attorney for former Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay. Lay is a defendant in the suits filed in Washington and Brazos counties. 
Federal law calls for such cases involving 50 or more plaintiffs to be removed to federal courts where similar cases have been filed, Collins said. 
Although the suits filed in Washington and Brazos counties have fewer than 50 plaintiffs, they should be moved to federal courts, said Rusty Hardin, representing Andersen. Such suits are liable to be a recurring problem because, ""There are 252 counties left"" in Texas where such suits could be filed.

Enron collapse subjects British government, opposition to accusations

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

LONDON (AP) - Enron's collapse has cast a shadow over Downing Street, with Prime Minister Tony Blair under pressure to explain how Enron won favorable government decisions after giving financial support to the Labor Party. Questions also are being raised about Labor's relationship with Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditors. 
Opposition Conservatives are seeking to capitalize. But they also accepted Enron's support, and Enron's board included John Wakeham, a well-connected senior figure in past Conservative governments who now may face questioning about the company's collapse.
""What you have here is thousands of words, very little story,"" Blair's official spokesman told reporters Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The Labor Party has confirmed that Enron gave the equivalent of 36,000 pounds (dlrs 50,760) between 1997 and 2000 - at a time when Enron was pressing the government to lift a moratorium on new gas-fired power generating plants. 
The moratorium stopped Enron's plans for a 1,200-megawatt station in southeastern England. By the time the moratorium was lifted in November 2000, gas prices had doubled and Enron did not pursue the project. 
Opposition critics note that Enron spent 15,000 pounds (dlrs 21,000) to host a reception at the Labor party conference in 1998, shortly after the government approved Enron's takeover of Wessex water, which supplies domestic water and sewer service in southwestern England. 
Ralph Hodge, former chairman of Enron Europe, said he had advised the company to sponsor events in conjunction with political parties rather than make direct donations. 
""Meetings were held with ministers and officials on a number of occasions before and after Enron sponsored events at party conferences and conventions. I am certain that these meetings would have taken place irrespective of any sponsorships,"" Hodge said. 
Opposition Liberal Democrat Matthew Tayler has sharply questioned Enron's courting of the Blair government. 
""We know that in the United States Enron used extensive political contacts to seek to further its interests, and there is good evidence of the same happening here in the UK,"" Taylor said. 
""Taking on former Labor employees to lobby for a change in gas policy and bingo, gas policy changes; paying for tables at the Labor Party conference and seeking direct contact at the time of the takeover of Wessex Water and bingo, that is approved."" 
But the Labor Party's general secretary, David Triesman, scoffed at such charges in a television interview this week. 
""The idea that a government switches its policy on energy a week after having a gala dinner is really among the more absurd claims I've heard in my political life,"" Triesman said. 
On Tuesday, Blair's office released details of seven meetings between ministers and Enron executives between April 1988, when Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay met then-Industry Minister John Battle, and October 2000. 
The Department of Trade and Industry said it did not keep records of who initiated each of the meetings. 
Enron's outlay for political contacts - including some 25,000 pounds (dlrs 35,000) to the Conservative Party - pale in comparison to political contributions of dlrs 5.77 million in the United States in the last 12 years. 
The opposition apparently doesn't yet sense a major opportunity to attack Blair over Enron. 
During the prime minister's question session in Parliament on Wednesday, Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith decided instead to probe Blair about problems in the National Health Service and the Labor Party's financial support from a union that is currently disrupting rail service with a series of 48-hour strikes. 
A decade ago, Enron successfully lobbied Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government for permission to build one of the first gas-fired electric generating plants in Britain. 
The minister who approved that project, John Wakeham, joined Enron's board as a non-executive director in 1994 - and now finds himself under fire. 
Nick Harvey, a Liberal Democrat lawmaker, has called for Wakeham to give up one of his most prominent jobs: chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, a politically sensitive post in which he has dealt with complaints from people aggrieved by newspapers, including Blair and the royal family. 
Wakeham has not responded. 
Conservatives also have questioned Labor's relationship with Arthur Andersen, which was banned from doing business with the government because of its association with the De Lorean sports car venture in Northern Ireland. The company went bankrupt in 1982 after its founder, John de Lorean, was arrested in California on drug charges. 
Successive Conservative governments barred contracts with Andersen and sought to reclaim 200 million pounds (dlrs 280 million at current rates) in compensation. 
Shortly after Blair won power in 1997, the government settled the case for 21 million pounds (dlrs 25.8 million). 
Energy Minister Brian Wilson said former Conservative Prime Minister John Major's government set up the machinery which led to the decision to reinstate Andersen. 
John Morris, now Lord Morris, Blair's attorney general from 1997 to 1999, said he made the decision to settle ""entirely on legal advice."" 
""The advice from departmental lawyers was that the sooner the better the litigation ... should be brought to an end,"" he told British Broadcasting Corp. radio. 
Conservative Party vice-chairman Tim Collins complained that the decision was entirely made by Blair's government. 
""It was the Labor Party that decided to settle for only 10 percent of the money the taxpayer was, in our view, owed.""

Bank of America Fires Two Bankers Who Handled Enron
2002-01-30 14:40 (New York)

     New York, Jan. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Bank of America Corp. fired two employees who managed the firm's business with Enron Corp. after the third-biggest bank lost $231 million when the energy trader filed for bankruptcy, people familiar with the matter said.
     The bank dismissed Jo Tamalis, the client manager for Enron, and Marcia Bateman, who oversaw loans to the energy firm, the people said. Tamalis said she no longer worked for the bank and declined to say why. Bateman couldn't be reached. Bank of America spokeswoman Georgie Shields declined to comment.
     Bank of America is the first bank to fire executives because of Enron's collapse. Other financial firms from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. to Citigroup Inc., which wrote off more than $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter because of Enron and Argentina's debt default, may take similar steps, investors say.
     ""If you assume they were responsible, you as an investor like to see people held accountable,'' said Phil Larkins, market strategist for Legacy South Inc., which manages $400 million in assets and owns 200,000 Bank of America shares. ``Bank of America has a very large exposure to Enron.''
     The Bank of America firings are some of the ripple effects in the financial services industry from Enron's collapse. Congressional investigators are demanding names of investors in limited partnerships Enron used to inflate earnings and hide debt from shareholders. Merrill Lynch & Co. executives invested in one of the partnerships, which also drew money from Citigroup, American International Group Inc. and other firms.

Bondholders

     Money managers including Putnam Investments, the fourth largest U.S. mutual fund company, Federated Investors Inc. and Dreyfus Corp. bought bonds issued by Enron trusts, according to regulatory filings. Northern Trust Corp., the trustee for Enron's retirement plan, owned the bonds, and also said this month it held more than $24.5 million in unsecured Enron debt.
     Bank of America was one of the biggest lenders to Enron as part of a $3 billion credit facility that was arranged by J.P. Morgan and Citigroup.
     Bank of America shares gained 1.37 to $60.56.
     ""Bankers have made a lot of bad judgment calls regarding Enron,'' said Carl Domino, president of Northern Trust Value Investors, which holds Bank of America shares.
     Tamalis, reached at her home in Houston, declined to comment. ""I don't want to give an interview,'' she said.
     The largest bankruptcy helped push J.P. Morgan and FleetBoston Financial Corp. into their first quarterly losses in years. J.P. Morgan Chase wrote off $456 million of trading losses and loans to Enron and still has exposure to potential losses of $2.06 billion. Bank of America said this month loans and other business with Enron cost the company $231 million.
     For Bank of America, the losses on loans to Enron came after a string of bad loans hurt the firm's earnings. The bank wrote off a total of $1.19 billion of bad loans in the fourth quarter, up 11 percent from a year earlier.
     ``Enron may well have been the straw that broke the camel's back,'' Domino said.
     Congress will be looking into the role of Enron's financiers, especially those in the limited partnerships, in hiding debt from investors, said Representative Henry Waxman, a California
Democrat.
     ``This needs to be thoroughly investigated,'' he said. ``One of the big mysteries about Enron is who the secret partners were, what they knew about Enron's precarious financial situation, and whether they did anything wrong.''

Other Cuts

     Bank of America said last year it planned to cut 600 jobs in corporate and investment banking to help reduce costs. As part of those cuts, the bank is firing three loan syndication executives who worked in project finance: Parker Knight, managing director and head of international syndicated finance, Brian Goldstein, head of U.S. project finance syndications, and John O'Neill, head of Asian project finance.
     Their jobs are being cut as part of Bank of America's restructuring of its global corporate and investment bank, said William Hodges, the bank's head of debt capital markets.
    ``The impact on these three individuals leaving the company is not related to Enron in any way,'' Hodges said.
    The bank is scaling back lending for capital projects, such as refineries and generation plants, in the U.S. and Asian energy and power industries, Hodges said. That type of lending ties up capital, and Bank of America isn't willing to continue doing it unless borrowers agree to give the bank more lucrative business as well.
    ""It entails risk factors that are less than highly desirable,'' Hodges said.
     Loan syndication employees in Latin America and Asia who previously reported to Knight now report to executives in those regions. ``In Latin America and Asia, we now have a regional model,'' Hodges said. ""The head of the region is now responsible for all of our client coverage and business development.''
     Hodges said Bank of America is ceasing, on a stand-alone basis, traditional project finance in the U.S., a unit headed by Goldstein, and in Asia, a unit headed by O'Neill.

Lawmakers Fear 'Loopholes' In Electricity Deregulation Bill

01/30/2002

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Mutual fund investors could be stung by future Enron-type collapses if Congress adopts an electricity bill with ""potentially dangerous loopholes,"" some House Democrats warned Wednesday. 
In a Jan. 30, letter to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., and Edward Markey, D-Mass., said they fear fund investors could be stung by loopholes in the bill, HR 3406.
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, would deregulate markets for electric power. 
A section of the bill would ""grandfather"" existing holding companies, allowing them to avoid rules governing mutual funds. Dingell and Markey said they are ""extremely wary"" of that, fearing it might allow grandfathered utility holding companies to spinoff firms that wouldn't be subject to the same rules as other mutual funds. 
""They could therefore engage in some of the risky and speculative investment strategies pursued by hedge funds,"" exposing investors to enormous risks, the lawmakers wrote. 
A House subcommittee may act on the bill as early as next month. Given that, Democratic lawmakers asked the SEC to analyze the bill, including the proposal to grandfather holding companies in existence at the end of 2001. 
In a related area, lawmakers asked the SEC to provide information on a 1997 SEC staff decision to exempt Enron from being regulated as a mutual fund. 
Among other things, the Democrats asked whether ""some of the potentially fraudulent actions subsequently undertaken by Enron might have been prevented"" if it had been subject to mutual fund rules.

Shareholder Files State Lawsuit Against Enron Execs
By Erwin Seba

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- An Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) shareholder filed a class action lawsuit Friday in state court in Houston against Enron's current and former executives and directors.
Henry P. Blaskie, Jr., of Columbus, Ohio, is also suing Enron's former auditor Arthur Andersen LLP. 
Among the defendants, the suit names ""the estate of J. Clifford Baxter."" 
Baxter, a former Enron vice chairman, was found dead in his car early Friday morning by Sugar Land, Texas, police. Police said Baxter suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and have described his death as an apparent suicide. 
The suit was filed late Friday afternoon in Harris County District Court. 
Former Chairman Kenneth Lay, former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow were also named in the suit. 
Blaskie alleges the executives and directors ""breached their fiduciary duty"" by releasing misleading financial statements which encouraged shareholders to continue ownership of Enron stock. 
Blaskie also alleges Andersen aided in the breach of fiduciary duty by certifying the company's financial statements. 
Blaskie is represented by Houston Attorney John Emerson. Blaskie is suing on behalf of himself and all those people who bought Enron stock before Oct. 16, 1998, and held the stock through Oct. 16, 2001. 
Blaskie owned 700 shares of Enron common stock. 
Attorneys for the defendants were unavailable for comment Wednesday afternoon.

USA: Ex-Enron executive Baxter euologized for successes.
By Nicole Volpe

01/30/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

AMITYVILLE, New York, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Family and friends of J. Clifford Baxter, the 43-year-old former Enron vice chairman who died of an apparent suicide last week, gathered on Wednesday to recall a life they said should not be eclipsed by the way it ended or by scandal at the company he led for seven months. 
""The shame is that the whole world is going to know him as the vice chairman of this big company where things went crazy,"" said John Bochicchio, a friend who graduated with Baxter from Amityville High School. ""We knew him here in Amitvyille growing up as a great guy, playing ball and climbing trees. It's a very sad day.""
The Houston-based energy trading company's murky accounting practices led to its December spiral into the largest U.S. bankruptcy in history. 
Baxter, who complained about questionable financial deals at Enron before resigning in May, seven months after being promoted to vice chairman, was found dead of a gunshot to the head near his suburban Houston home last Friday. 
Baxter's death came a day after the start of congressional hearings in Washington on Enron's collapse. 
He resigned for what the company said was a desire to spend more time with his family in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land. But an August memo from an Enron whistleblower indicated Baxter had feuded with the then-chief executive about methods the company was using to hide billions of dollars in debt. 
About 150 of Baxter's family and friends filled the St. Martin of Tours Church in this small Long Island town. One of his 35 cousins, Steven Garry, gave the eulogy. 
""It is for them and for us an unimaginable day,"" he said. 
""We will always remember what a decent, hard-working, upstanding person he was, not a bad bone in his body,"" said Garry. ""He always knew the right thing to say, he was always there, he was the go-to guy."" 
Large groups of reporters gathered in front of the church, filming the family as church bells tolled at the end of the service. Baxter is survived by a wife and two children. 
Baxter was a defendant in lawsuits targeting Enron's top executives, accusing them of cashing in on insider information.

"Dynegy Discussions","
Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

Cover Story: THE ENRON SCANDAL
CAN YOU TRUST ANYBODY ANYMORE? The scope of the Enron debacle undermines the credibility of modern business culture. Let's get back to basics
Essay by Bruce Nussbaum

01/28/2002
BusinessWeek
30
(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

There are business scandals that are so vast and so penetrating that they profoundly shock our most deeply held beliefs about the honesty and integrity of our corporate culture. Enron Corp. is one of them. This financial disaster goes far beyond the failure of one big company. This is corruption on a massive scale. Tremendous harm has befallen innocent employees who have seen their retirement savings disappear as a few at the top cashed out. Terrible things have happened to the way business is conducted under the cloak of deregulation. Serious damage has been done to ethical codes of conduct held by once-trusted business professionals. 
It is difficult not to contrast the professionalism of modestly paid firefighters and police doing their duty on September 11 with the secretive and squirrely behavior of six- and seven-figure accountants, lawyers, CEOs, bankers, and financial analysts who failed at their duty with Enron. The remarkable letter by Enron whistle-blower Sherron Watkins to Chairman Kenneth L. Lay in August that presciently warns of accounting scandals reads like a road map of corporate corruption, subterfuge, and manipulation. She worries about the world perceiving Enron's ``past successes as nothing more than an elaborate accounting hoax'' (page 34).
The Enron debacle calls into question a host of other aggressive accounting techniques used across a wide spectrum of Corporate America--most of them quite legal. And that's precisely the point. It's getting harder and harder to know what a company actually earns and what its stock is actually worth. An astonishing 723 companies have been forced to restate and lower their earnings since 1997. With enormous pressures to produce earnings growth, auditors are being turned into enablers. They forsake their traditional role of outside skeptic for that of inside business partner and they reject their age-old function of discloser of information for that of master magician who hides the financial rabbit (page 44). 
Investor confidence is crucial to the success of our economic system. This confidence is threatened by not only the Enron scandal but by the dramatic decline in accounting standards. People increasingly feel the game is rigged. Unless Washington and business professionals seize the moment to clean up the mess in the market economy, they risk a major populist backlash. 
In the end, Enron was able to enlist precisely those referees who, in the past, would oversee and check its behavior--accountants, lawyers, bankers, legislators, even regulators--in the pursuit of higher earnings. Many were tempted by a piece of the equity action and compromised their integrity. Enron paid big fees to many of these professionals to help manufacture its earnings, and together they created the mechanisms for evading the financial truth. 
Watkins says as much. She talks of partnership deals that temporarily inflate the stock price, allowing execs to cash out options: ``It's a bit like robbing the bank in one year and trying to pay it back two years later.'' She adds, ``nice try but investors were hurt'' when they bought stock that later fell. In a free-market economy, companies are supposed to fail because of the business cycle or bad business decisions. Failure from loose and sleazy practices, if not outright fraud, is another matter. 
We now know that something went seriously wrong in the march to deregulation. There is no question that deregulated markets are generating lower costs, higher growth, and lower unemployment for the U.S. economy. But dereg ideologues, such as Enron's President Jeffrey K. Skilling and the company's political allies in Washington, convinced the nation deregulation meant no regulation. A big mistake. Enron and other companies used the transition to deregulation to gain access to Congress and regulators and write their own rules. They persuaded the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to let Enron and a few other companies run largely unregulated energy-derivatives trading businesses. Wendy Gramm, who at the time was head of the CFTC, later joined Enron's board of directors--on the audit committee. 
Financial complexity made it easy to mask the truth and play financial games. The financialization and securitization of the real economy into mathematical bits and bytes allowed Enron and others to massage earnings results in infinite ways. Off-balance-sheeting financial engineering became the requisite way to boost earnings and stock prices. Hundreds of companies have done it (page 36). Common standards were replaced by idiosyncratic measures. Slowly but surely, the financial truth disappeared. No one, not the accountants or lawyers or bankers or Wall Street analysts, protested as the bottom line became a fiction. On the road to deregulation, basic building blocks of capitalism--clarity, transparency, fairness, openness--were sacrificed. Everything the public needs to evaluate risk, value stocks, and participate in an equity culture was undermined. Americans embraced the equity economy in the '90s because they believed they could participate in it fairly. They didn't expect to see their 401(k)s go up in smoke. 
Who can come to the rescue? The reputations of many of the professionals who were counted on to safeguard the economic system lie in tatters. Corrupted by the chase for an ever-greater piece of the action, accountants, lawyers, analysts, and managers have shirked their duty on a scale not seen since the 1920s. Conflicts of interest abound as accounting firms sell services to the companies they audit and accountants jump to the corporations whose books they examine. The accounting profession has successfully fought all attempts at reform, rebuffing efforts to end conflicts of interest, impose stricter oversight, or increase liability for their actions. In short, most certified public accountants feel little duty to the public at large. 
Nor do lawyers see themselves as officers of the court, which they are. Vinson & Elkins LLP was asked by Enron Chairman Lay to check out whether Watkins' seven-page warning of financial deceit warranted action. It came back with a ``No.'' Wall Street analysts stopped being honest when their compensation became contingent on their firms getting investment-banking business from the companies they covered. And bankers are too busy selling fee-based services to carry out due diligence on loans and debt. They have enormous conflicts of interest. The Glass-Steagall Act was passed in 1933 to stop those conflicts. Its repeal in 1999 has ushered in their return. 
What's to be done? Restoring investor confidence in the system of equity capitalism is crucial to the economy's health. The continued deregulation of the economy and the privatization of services depends on the integrity of the financial reporting system. If the investing public is going to participate, it must see a fair and transparent system. 
The pendulum is swinging toward reform. The accounting changes required are all too obvious. But change must go beyond the scope of the financial implosion. The buying and selling of political access is not in the best interests of the country. It is unseemly to have the head of the Justice Dept., as well as the entire Houston branch, recuse themselves because of conflicts on the Enron case. A sense of outrage is growing. The lesson from the Enron debacle should be to restore basic integrity to the bottom line, ethics to business professionals, and clout to overseers that even a deregulated economy need.

A HERO--AND A SMOKING-GUN LETTER Watkins' memo spoke volumes about Enron's behavior. So did higher-ups' tepid response

At last, someone in the sordid Enron Corp. scandal seems to have done the right thing. Thanks to whistle-blower Sherron S. Watkins, a no-nonsense Enron vice-president, the scope and audacity of the accounting mess is becoming all too clear. Her blunt Aug. 15 letter to Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay warns that the company might ``implode in a wave of accounting scandals.'' And now that her worst fears have been realized, it is also clear that Watkins' letter went far beyond highlighting a few accounting problems in a handful of off-balance-sheet partnerships. Watkins' letter lays bare for all to see the underbelly of Enron's get-rich-quick culture. 
Watkins, 42, a former Arthur Andersen accountant who remains Enron's vice-president for corporate development, put her finger on the rot: top execs who, at best, appeared to close their eyes to questionable accounting maneuvers; a leadership that had lost sight of ordinary investors and the basic principles of accounting; and watchdogs--the outside auditors and lawyers whose own involvement may have left them too conflicted to query the nature of the deals. Perhaps the question shouldn't be how Enron collapsed so quickly--but why it didn't implode sooner.
Lay's response to Watkins' complaints is nearly as damning as her letter itself. Yes, he talked to her for an hour. And, yes, he ordered an outside investigation. But contrary to Watkins' advice, he appointed the company's longtime Houston law firm, Vinson & Elkins, despite the obvious conflict: V&E had worked on some of the partnerships. And Enron and V&E agreed there would be no ``second-guessing'' of Andersen's accounting and no ``detailed analysis'' of each and every transaction, according to V&E's Oct. 15 report. The inquiry was to consider only if there was new factual information that warranted a broader investigation. V&E declined comment. 
Surprise: V&E concluded that a widespread investigation wasn't warranted. It simply warned that there was a ``serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation.'' And Watkins' letter reveals the inadequacy of Lay's response in the months following CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling's sudden Aug. 14 resignation for ``personal reasons.'' His departure triggered the letter. Lay never fully disclosed the partnerships or explained their impact to investors, even as he vowed there were no accounting issues and ``no other shoe to fall.'' Even after Enron revealed on Oct. 16 a $1.2 billion hit to shareholder equity related to the partnerships, Lay continued to express ignorance about details of these deals and support for Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, who managed and had stakes in certain partnerships. But on Oct. 24, Fastow was removed from his job and promptly left the company. 
Watkins, an eight-year Enron veteran, is not some disgruntled naysayer who is easy to dismiss. Her lawyer, Philip H. Hilder, says she became familiar with some of the partnership dealings when she worked in June and July in Fastow's finance group. Her position allowed her to review the valuation of certain assets being sold into the partnerships, and that's when she saw ``computations that just didn't jibe,'' says Hilder. 
Former executives say the Tomball (Tex.) native was tenacious and competent. ``She wasn't really an alarmist,'' says one former Enron employee. Her mother, Shirley Klein Harrington, a former high school accounting teacher, calls her daughter ``a very independent, outspoken, good Christian girl, who's going to stand up for principle whenever she can.'' Watkins had previously worked at Andersen in Houston and New York and then for Germany's Metallgesellschaft AG. 
At those companies, she befriended Jeffrey McMahon, whom she helped recruit. Now the CFO at Enron, McMahon ``complained mightily'' about the Fastow partnerships to Skilling, Watkins told Lay in the letter. ``Employees question our accounting propriety consistently and constantly,'' she claimed. McMahon didn't return calls. Skilling has denied getting any warnings about accounting. 
Watkins didn't stop there. Five days after she wrote to Lay, Watkins took her concerns directly to an Andersen audit partner, according to congressional investigators. He in turn relayed her questions to senior Andersen management on the Enron account. It's not known what, if any, action they took. 
Of course, Skilling and Andersen execs shouldn't have needed a letter and a phone call from Watkins to figure out something was seriously amiss. Red flags abounded. And Watkins, for one, had no trouble putting her finger on questionable accounting practices. She wondered if Enron was hiding losses in off-balance-sheet entities while booking large profits from the deals. At the same time, the outside partnerships were backed with Enron stock--a tactic sure to backfire when it was falling--and no outsiders seemed to have any capital at risk. Was Enron creating income essentially by doing deals with itself? ``It sure looks to the layman on the street that we are hiding losses in a related company and will compensate that company with Enron stock in the future,'' she wrote. 
In the end, Watkins grasped one thing that Enron's too-clever-by-half dealmakers didn't: Enron's maneuvering didn't pass the smell test. Even if Enron and its high-priced auditors and lawyers can ultimately show that they followed the letter of the law, it matters little. As Watkins herself wrote, if Enron collapses, ``the business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax.'' And that seems destined to become Enron's epitaph.

THE PERFECT SALES PITCH: NO DEBT, NO WORRIES

At Enron Corp., debt avoidance wasn't merely a strategy for managing its own balance sheet. It was a way of life that pervaded the company's dealmaking culture. Consider Enron Energy Services, which managed energy needs and equipment for big corporate customers. The company held regular seminars to teach EES employees how to use complex financial vehicles to woo customers, manage earnings, and, naturally, keep debt off balance sheets at Enron and its clients. Former Enron executive Michael R. Boutcher recalls a class on structured finance that described the financings as ``accounting nirvana''--able to not only get debt off the books but even out of accounting footnotes. 
No one is claiming that these structures were akin to the off-balance-sheet partnerships at the heart of Enron's accounting scandal. These deals gave tax and other benefits to customers who outsourced their energy management to Enron. But they certainly highlight Enron's aggressive philosophy of leveraging its financial acumen. Boutcher, manager of business development at EES until Enron's December collapse, says that creating complex financings with clients was standard practice. And, he says, Enron used them far more aggressively than its rivals. ``We could always sweeten the pot, and the objective was to beat out anybody that was competing against us,'' says Boutcher. An Enron spokeswoman says such equipment financing was common in the industry. But several rivals disagree.
In a presentation on Nov. 9, 2000, to some 60 employees in Houston, Boutcher says, a company lawyer explained how structured-finance deals could manage and accelerate earnings for Enron and take debt ``off credit'' for customers, so that it wouldn't be reflected in credit ratings. The objective laid out in one page of the presentation couldn't have been clearer: ``Off credit: Difficult to achieve. ...Must make it look like the company has no financial obligation at all under any circumstances, including default by them.'' 
EES says it never actually did one of the ``off-credit'' deals. There were some things even Enron couldn't peddle.

Cover Story: THE ENRON SCANDAL: DISCLOSURE
WHO ELSE IS HIDING DEBT Moving financial obligations into off-book vehicles is now a common ploy
By David Henry, with Heather Timmons and Steve Rosenbush in New York and Michael Arndt in Chicago

When energy trader Enron Corp. admitted to hiding billions of dollars of liabilities in mysterious off-book entities, it trotted out the lame excuse of scoundrels: Everyone does it. And this time, it was the gospel truth. 
Hundreds of respected U.S. companies are ferreting away trillions of dollars in debt in off-balance-sheet subsidiaries, partnerships, and assorted obligations, including leases, pension plans, and take-or-pay contracts with suppliers. Potentially bankrupting contracts are mentioned vaguely in footnotes to company accounts, at best. The goal is to skirt the rules of consolidation, the bedrock of the American financial reporting system and the source of much its credibility. These rules, set clear in 1959, aim to make public companies give a full and fair picture of their business--including all the assets and liabilities of any subsidiaries. But accountants, lawyers, and bankers have learned to drive a coach and horses through them.
Because of a gaping loophole in accounting practice, companies create arcane legal structures, often called special-purpose entities (SPEs). Then, the parent can bankroll up to 97% of the initial investment in an SPE without having to consolidate it into its own accounts. Normally, once a company owns 50% or more of another, it must consolidate it under the 1959 rules. The controversial exception that outsiders need invest only 3% of an SPE's capital for it to be independent and off the balance sheet came about through fumbles by the Securities & Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. In 1990, accounting firms asked the SEC to endorse the 3% rule that had become a common, though unofficial, practice in the '80s. The SEC didn't like the idea, but it didn't stomp on it, either. It asked the FASB to set tighter rules to force consolidation of entities that were effectively controlled by companies. FASB drafted two overhauls of the rules but never finished the job, and the SEC is still waiting. 
It's not just the energy industry that exploits the loophole and stashes major liabilities in the never-never land of SPEs. Increasingly, companies of all stripes routinely use them to offload potential balance-sheet bombshells such as loan guarantees or the financing of sales of their own products. For example, the accounts of data processor Electronic Data Systems Corp. don't show $500 million--half of last year's earnings--that it would owe if its customers were to cancel their contracts and leave it holding the bag for loans on their computer equipment. The arrangement is acknowledged only in a footnote. An EDS spokesman says the tactic is common in the industry and does not put the company at undue risk. 
Airlines keep appearances aloft by shunting billions worth of airplane financing into off-balance-sheet vehicles, says credit analyst Philip Baggaley of Standard & Poor's Corp. United Airlines Inc. parent UAL Corp.'s published balance sheet for 2000 shows $5 billion of long-term debt. But only a footnote describes the bulk of its lease payments, which Baggaley estimates have a present value of $12.7 billion, due over 26 years on 233 airplanes. AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines Inc., is on the hook for $7.9 billion in lease payments not on its balance sheet. ``Everyone who's involved in the industry knows that the true leverage is higher'' than what's shown on the balance sheet, says Baggaley. UAL and AMR declined to comment. 
Banks arrange many of the devices and are big users themselves. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., for example, has revealed in the Enron bankruptcy that it has nearly $1 billion in potential liabilities stemming from a single 49%-owned Channel Islands entity called Mahonia that traded with Enron. The liabilities bring the bank's total Enron exposure to $2.6 billion. And J.P. Morgan is not alone. A suit filed earlier this month shows that many U.S. finance companies are among 52 partners in LJM2, an Enron off-balance-sheet entity with over $300 million in assets. The partners, including Citigroup, Wachovia, and American International Group, may all have to takes losses on it. 
The banks' participation in SPEs is attracting scrutiny of federal regulators. A Federal Reserve spokesman said it is ``concerned about'' off-balance-sheet exposures and hopes new accounting rules will be put in place. How many more Mahonia or LJM2-like entities are there? The Channel Islands tax haven boasts more than 350 SPEs and similar entities, though it is impossible to know how many should really be consolidated on balance sheets of U.S. companies. Assets in the entities total more than $635 billion, according to Fitzrovia International PLC, a London-based research firm. The Cayman Islands, which has been competing for the business since the 1980s, claims another 600 trusts and banks, most of which have SPE expertise. 
With some of the vehicles, it is impossible for investors to know from financial reports who could be responsible for what. For example, Dell Computer Corp. has a joint venture with Tyco International Ltd. called Dell Financial Services that last year originated $2.5 billion in customer financing, according to a footnote to Dell's accounts. According to the note, Dell owns 70% of DFS, but does not control it and therefore keeps DFS debts off its own balance sheet. What if DFS has trouble from customers not paying? Dell spokesman T.R. Reid says any obligations of DFS are Tyco's responsibility and Tyco agrees. Jeffrey D. Simon, president of the global vendor financing business at Tyco Capital, says Tyco would look to Dell's customers to pay and not to Dell. Tyco's balance sheet reflects borrowing to finance Dell's customers. 
Companies argue that off-balance-sheet vehicles benefit investors because they enable management to tap extra sources of financing and hedge trading risks that could roil earnings. Maybe so, but they sure make the companies, and their executives, look good: Return on capital looks better than it is because balance sheets understate the amount employed. And investors and regulators don't freak out as corporate debt balloons. But critics charge that the widespread use of off-balance-sheet schemes encourages contempt for accounting rules in the executive suite and spreads confusion among investors. ``The nonprofessional has no idea of the extent of the real liabilities,'' says J. Edward Ketz, accounting professor at Pennsylvania State University. ``Professionals can be easily fooled, too.'' 
Worse yet, many SPEs have provisions that can throw their users into a full-blown financial crisis. To get assets off its books, a company typically sells them to an SPE, funding the purchase by borrowing cash from institutional investors. As a sweetener to protect investors, many SPEs incorporate triggers that require the parent to repay loans or give them new securities if its stock falls below a certain price or credit-rating agencies downgrade its debt. It was just such triggers in its notorious off-balance-sheet partnerships that sent Enron into a death spiral. And triggers fueled the crises last year at Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, and Xerox, according to Moody's Investors Service. ``All of this hidden debt and these triggers could make the next economic downturn a lot worse than it would otherwise be,'' says Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant at the Securities & Exchange Commission until July. 
Despite the risks, SPEs remain very appealing to companies. And any attempt to curb them or abolish the 3% rule will run into furious opposition. Since the early '90s, an army of accountants, lawyers, and bankers built a huge industry to concoct ever more creative ways to evade consolidated reporting. So reform won't come easily. ``It will be a phenomenal fight,'' says Turner. 
Maybe so, but Enron's demise shows how quickly a tiny loophole can tear the country's economic fabric. And there may never be a better time to close it.

Out of Sight
Many companies keep debts and other obligations out of investors' view in
partnerships and other entities. Often, financial liabilities are secured
by physical assets such as planes or computers. A sample:

Special-purpose vehicles used to control market, credit rating 
By DAN FELDSTEIN 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 28, 2002, 6:31AM
As accountants, stockbrokers and others study Enron's collapse, they focus on the company's now-infamous ""special-purpose vehicles"" -- independent companies that propped up Enron's income and hid its debt. 
They want to know whether the vehicles' goosing of Enron's financial statements was a side effect or their sole purpose. 
One good clue is the list. 
In the last year at Enron Global Finance group, managers were sometimes handed a list of Enron assets and instructed to go out and sell some to the vehicles, said an employee with direct knowledge of the procedure. 
""Knowing what I do now, I know that was used directly to manipulate the (stock) market,"" the employee said. 
A manager would pick something, from a plant to stock to a piece of a start-up company. Then he would walk the deal through a team of internal lawyers and auditors. 
The bigger the ""sale,"" the bigger his bonus. 
What actually happened was that a bank or other investor lent money to the newly created company to finance the purchase. The new company, in turn, paid the money to Enron. 
Why didn't Enron just get a loan itself without going through a middleman? Because the loan now belonged to the new company, not Enron, and thus didn't count as a debt on Enron's financial statement. 
Instead, it counted as income to Enron when the new company passed on the proceeds. 
Less debt and more income do wonders for a quarterly report. The procedure assured Enron would keep its high credit rating, saving big bucks, and would keep the stock price up. 
After a while, the employee said, employees joked that there would be no assets left to deal. 
""Every associate on up knew. We used to joke about, `I want this thing to stand up until I get my money and go,' "" he said. 
Two former Enron employees who worked on the special-purpose vehicles spoke at length to the Chronicle about what they did for a living. One met with a reporter in the offices of a Rice University accounting professor. 
The employees, graduates of top schools, spoke on the condition that they not be identified. 
Both said there were many uses for the vehicles that they considered legitimate, such as bringing in outside partners to share the risks of a particular venture. But there was little question, especially toward the end in the finance group, that many had no real ""business purpose"" other than improving financial appearances. 
""They are created merely to make the income statement look better. An average person would say there's something wrong,"" said Michael Granof, a University of Texas accounting professor. 
The employee with direct knowledge of the process didn't disagree. It's just sort of what they did, he said, and he never realized the extent of the company's debt. 
The anatomy of the deal was simple, he said. 
Say the asset was 100 shares of IBM stock. Enron would divide each share into two parts, one called a ""control interest"" and one called an ""economic interest."" Then it would sell the economic interest to a newly created special-purpose vehicle. 
The asset was rarely as simple as 100 shares of another company's stock. So Enron had to put a value on it. Because there wasn't really an outside buyer, it decided the price itself and had that number blessed by its auditor, Arthur Andersen. 
The deal was placed with a bank, insurance company or other major lender, which put up 97 percent of the money. Sometimes the promise of Enron stock would be put up to guarantee the loan, as a sort of collateral, although Enron stockholders were never told of the risk that their shares could be diluted if such new shares had to be issued, the employee said. 
To qualify as ""independent"" from Enron for accounting purposes, an SPV had to be owned by someone else. So an outside entity would be brought in to make the required investment, which was just 3 percent of the SPV's total start-up cash. 
In some cases, Enron is alleged to have lent that money to the outside equity partners, though the employee said he had no direct knowledge of that. 
Enron no longer owned the economic interest in the asset, but it did own control over it. In the sales contract with the vehicle, Enron promised always to act in the interest of the SPV. Lawyers and auditors said all this was OK. 
As the asset made money for the SPV -- if it did, and many didn't -- it made principal and interest payments to the lender and issued dividends to the outside equity partners, just like in a normal company. 
So what was left for Enron? Unlike a normal company, the yield to the equity partners was capped. If the partner's yield cap was 15 percent and the asset made 20 percent, Enron got 5 percent. 
Most important, Enron got to report the proceeds of the sale of the asset as earnings. It had to repay the loan, of course, but the debt didn't show up on Enron's financial statements. 
A basic question is why Enron didn't just sell the assets normally to raise money. The answer is control, the employee said. If the asset were a plant, perhaps Enron would give itself the operating and maintenance contract. If it were private shares of another company, maybe Enron was technically forbidden to sell, or it could make another deal later. 
By keeping its visible debt low, Enron retained a higher credit rating and thus paid a lower interest rate on money it borrowed and money borrowed by the SPVs, the employee said. 
When Enron was forced to restate its earnings last year to include some of that debt, and as debt from other sources also surfaced, Moody's Investor Services downgraded Enron's bond rating. With a trading company such as Enron, where the ability to borrow vast sums at favorable interest rates is key, that was fatal. Bankruptcy quickly followed. 
Such accounting practices were a factor in the company's fall, but the real problem was that many of Enron's recent major investments -- broadband and water divisions, New Power and an Indian power plant -- did not work out, said the employee and Rice University accounting professor Bala Dharan, who also questioned the employee. 
""Investors don't like to hear you say, `Oh, I was wrong.' So you start having a yard sale to boost CFO (cash flow from operations) and net income,"" the employee said. 
The second employee said many SPVs were easier to justify. Sometimes they were created to bring two other parties together, with Enron merely providing the expertise. Both said investors were happy to get involved in the deals. 
But in recent years, the first employee said, their use became more questionable. 
""Is any of that illegal? No, but it's shady. The investor couldn't truly know what Enron owned or what Enron owed. People don't pay attention to the footnotes,"" he said. 
And the footnotes in Enron's required financial statements also weren't much help. Granof, an author of accounting textbooks with an MBA and doctorate, said he found them ""unintelligible."" 
""That was conscious. No two ways about it,"" the employee responded. 
Granof said he still couldn't quite understand why SPVs are considered legitimate. While expressing disappointment with Andersen for ""deceiving"" investors while meeting the letter of the law, he said, ""there but for the grace of God go four other major accounting firms"" of the Big Five that could have been similarly ensnared in the Enron fiasco. 
""Something is wrong with the rules,"" he said.

Enron's hazy legal landscape: Were strong laws violated by bad people, or did weak laws render such violation unnecessary?

It was called ""rotten, horrible, indefensible"" and ""shocking."" With those words, securities law experts around the country condemned the way Enron had structured and sold a partnership called LJM2, which offered investors a chance to profit from confidential information about Enron's investment plans -- and gave the partnership investors more information about the company's finances than Enron's shareholders received. ""This is potentially the most serious revelation about Enron to date,"" said Joel Seligman, a securities law historian and dean of the Washington University Law School. ""You can't overstate how shocking it is."" 
But did the arrangement, however unfair it seems to stockholders, actually violate the nation's securities laws and regulations?
That is far more difficult to answer, legal scholars say -- and far more important. For them, the fundamental question about the sprawling Enron scandal is whether it is a case of strong laws being violated by bad people, or of weak laws rendering such violations unnecessary. ""If a company of this size, advised by top-tier accountants and law firms, could conclude that our laws permit some of what happened here, then our laws are inadequate,"" said Richard C. Breeden, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""Clearly it violates the spirit and intent of securities laws and the whole concept of full and fair disclosure."" 
The quandary is particularly acute in the case of this partnership, because it seemed to thrive on arrangements -- procedural barriers known as ""Chinese walls"" -- that were actually intended to protect investors. These legal barriers prevented investment bankers who were privy to information about the partnership from legally sharing that information with shareholders. Instead, investors remained in the dark about Enron's actual financial condition. 
But the partnership, lawyers and finance experts say, raises novel questions about the effectiveness of other parts of the securities laws, as well. These include prohibitions against trading on inside information; rules against selectively disclosing information to some shareholders and not others; efforts to police corporate conflicts of interest and the wisdom of removing restrictions on the roles that investment banks can play. ""No matter how good you make the laws, there will always be a small group of people who will push them,"" said John Pound, a former finance professor at Harvard and the president of Integrity Partners, an investment management firm in Boston. ""But the Enron case has raised a lot of useful and important policy questions that will need to be addressed. And the Chinese-wall issue is a perfect example of that."" 
Enron's swift fall, culminating in its bankruptcy filing in early December, came after the company revised its past financial statements to more accurately reflect partnership deals like the LJM2 arrangement. The company and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, are the subjects of both criminal and regulatory investigations, and are being examined by nearly a dozen Congressional committees. 
One important focus of those investigations is the way that partnerships like LJM2 contributed to the company's collapse. 
Confidential records of that specific partnership, disclosed in The New York Times, show that Enron tried to attract investors by dangling the prospect of potentially remarkable returns, driven by access to inside information about Enron's financial dealings. 
Potential investors were told, in detail, about the company's off-the- books transactions and assets, information that Enron had not disclosed to its public shareholders. Indeed, partnership investors knew that Enron controlled at least 50% more assets than the company had disclosed in its audited financial statements, filed with the SEC and provided to public shareholders. 
That lopsided flow of information strikes many legal experts as a direct challenge to traditional thinking about Chinese walls, the common nickname for the procedures that assure that the confidential information Wall Street firms obtain from their corporate investment banking clients remains confidential, even within the firm itself. 
Chinese walls came into being in the late 1960s, as a regulatory response to the increased complexity of Wall Street firms and a more vigorous SEC response to insider trading, said Michael Perino, a securities law professor at St. John's University. 
Their purpose, quite simply, was to prevent an investment banker from using confidential information about a corporate client to make trades in that client's stock -- trades in which the banker would have an advantage over other investors. 
In 1988, at the end of a decade punctuated by insider trading scandals, Congress made such ""informational partitions"" mandatory, citing the need to prevent Wall Street insiders from taking advantage of Main Street investors. 
But in this case, it appears that the protection backfired, legal experts said. Investment bankers who worked on the Enron partnerships were privy to information that may have raised doubts about the information Enron had provided to public investors -- but they were forbidden by law from raising any red flags. 
""The purpose of the Chinese wall is to help public investors, but this worked backwards,"" said Mr. Pound, the former Harvard professor. ""What amazes me is that the people who knew they had information adverse to the public investors would not feel a need to find a way, within the institution, to address that issue -- to go up in the institution high enough to say, `We have a policy problem here.' "" 
The LJM2 partnership points up Chinese-wall problems that courts and regulators have been struggling to resolve for years, said John Coffee Jr., a securities law expert at Columbia University Law School. 
If the investment banking divisions of a brokerage firm had information that raised questions about the value of a public company's stock, there is nothing under the current law that the bankers could do to help the firm's retail investors. But there are more limited actions the firm could take, Mr. Coffee said. 
""They can't go out and privately tell their clients the full information they have received without being part of an insider trading scheme,"" he said. ""But they could arguably use the information to withdraw their recommendation on the stock."" That, he added, ""will cause some consternation and adverse publicity that would alert the market to a problem. 
Other legal experts worry that the investment banks dealing with Enron were constrained by conflicts between their role as lenders and their work as underwriters. 
This conflict, too, has roots deep in U.S. financial history. In the decade before the 1929 crash, banks would sometimes help a failing firm sell stock to the bank's customers to raise money to repay loans. As part of the New Deal, Congress passed the Glass- Steagall Act, which prevented banks from providing both underwriting and traditional banking services. 
But long before Congress officially repealed Glass-Steagall in 1999, Street firms found legal detours around the prohibition. Now, some securities law experts said, Congress may need to take a fresh look at whether these dual roles in any way affected the flow of significant information to public investors in Enron. 
Mr. Breeden, the former SEC chairman, said no direct parallels to the classic pre-1929 conflicts have appeared. But Enron's evolution ""was a very subtle situation, and very complex. In any case,"" he added, ""the public should be able to conclude where the investment banks' greatest interests lie."" 
That investors in the LJM2 partnership apparently got information that public investors could not get -- because Enron had moved certain operations off its balance sheet -- also underscores the importance of preventing selective disclosure by corporations, one former SEC commissioner said. 
Until last January, corporate executives would routinely hold private briefings for analysts, slipping them details that were not available to public investors. To ""level the playing field,"" the SEC enacted Regulation FD, which forbids such selective disclosure. 
It is not clear from available documents whether partnership investors continued to learn about Enron's finances after the new rule went into effect. ""But if they did, that raises blazing questions of selective disclosure,"" the former commissioner said. More broadly, he said, regulators should determine whether other corporations that use off-balance- sheet entities are giving investors in those entities more information than public stockholders receive. 
Sheldon Elsen, a securities lawyer at Orans Elsen & Lupert in New York, said the structure of the LJM2 partnership ""really presents some very troubling problems. I don't know that there is anything illegal here,"" Mr. Elsen said, ""but there is a terrible odour about it."" 
James Moriarty, a Houston lawyer who has represented plaintiffs in a number of securities fraud cases, said: ""That they would tell the truth to the rich investors, and lie to their stockholders, is outside the realm of the comprehensible."" 
Enron might argue that the information potential partnership investors got was not important enough to require disclosure. 
But lawyers said the fact Enron disclosed the information to them would be evidence in itself that such details were material. ""Given that they give the information to somebody else as part of their bargain to raise money for another deal, there is a strong likelihood that it would reach the materiality level,"" said Stanley Arkin, a New York corporate and securities lawyer. 
But the information gap between partnership investors and public stockholders is just one of the conflicts that litter the Enron battlefield, legal experts say. 
Congress is already wrestling with the potential conflicts that confront outside accounting firms, like Arthur Andersen. The firms act both as independent auditors -- which companies must have, by federal law -- and consultants on tax and technology issues. 
But that, too, just scratches the surface. The LJM2 partnership, like several others set up by Enron, was run by a general partnership, LJM2 Capital Partners, and managed by a second partnership, LJM2 Capital Management. The people behind both partnerships -- the ""principals"" -- were all Enron executives, including Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, and Michael J. Kopper, managing director at Enron's global equity markets group. ""Investors should be aware that there will be occasions where the general partner and its affiliates may encounter potential conflicts of interest in connection with the partnership's activities,"" the partnership sales documents said. It explained that the principals ""are employees at Enron and owe fiduciary duties to Enron and its subsidiaries; such fiduciary duties may from time to time conflict with fiduciary duties owed to the partnership and its partners."" 
Enron's board specifically approved Mr. Fastow's role by exempting him from the corporate conflict- of-interest policy -- a step that Mr. Breeden found inexplicable. ""The very notion that the chief financial officer of a major corporation could have divided loyalties to this degree of magnitude is something I wouldn't have believed any board of directors would allow -- or that any CFO would accept,"" Mr. Breeden said. ""The CFO is the financial conscience of the company, the guardian of the numbers. If he has a conflict, how can the system work?"" 
What is known about Enron's partnership arrangements so far, he said, reveals an even more profound conflict between management and shareholders. Because Enron had guaranteed the solvency of certain partnerships, obligations that were not disclosed on its balance sheet were secretly but steadily eroding its financial health. 
""It is as if Enron and its top officers had set up a loaded machine gun and aimed it at the company -- and the shareholders didn't know it,"" Mr. Breeden said. 
Two things, however, seem certain, legal experts said. 
The first is that these fresh disclosures about how Enron's partnerships were structured and sold will expand the number of defendants named in the shareholder lawsuits aimed at trying to recover some of investors' market losses, which have been estimated at more than US$60-billion. 
Every large institution -- whether an underwriter or partnership investor -- that was aware of material information withheld from Enron investors could find itself in court, securities lawyers said. 
Already, they said, lawyers are discussing which investors, institutions and advisers are potential defendants. ""The image I have in my mind is a long, long line of the wealthy and the powerful who made money out of these deals, all set up to hand it over to the people who lost everything in their Enron investments,"" said Mr. Moriarty. 
The second consequence is likely to be systematic Congressional action to amend the nation's securities laws, said Mr. Seligman.

Enron Executive's Suicide-Note Release Delayed by Texas Police
2002-01-28 11:20 (New York)

     Sugar Land, Texas, Jan. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Corp. Vice Chairman John Clifford Baxter's suicide note will remain under seal until an investigation of his death is completed, the Sugar Land Police Department said in a statement.
     Police previously promised to release the note this week, possibly as early as today, following a review by the Harris County Medical Examiner's Office, which ruled Baxter's Friday death Friday a suicide. Police decided Saturday to extend the investigation and delayed disclosure of the note, according to the statement.
     Baxter, 43, was found in his 2002 Mercedes-Benz at 2:23 a.m. Friday with a self-inflicted gunshot would to the head. He was the lone occupant of the car and a revolver was found near his body.
     Sugar Land Police Chief Earnest Taylor said in a statement Saturday that his department wasn't disagreeing with the autopsy results, but making sure ``we cross all the T's and dot all the I's.''
     A suicide note found at the scene said Baxter was distraught over Enron's fall and the prospect of testifying against friends who worked there, CNBC reported late Friday.
     Baxter resigned in May after a decade with Enron. The company is the subject of numerous shareholder lawsuits, as well as Congressional and criminal investigations, after filing the largest bankruptcy in corporate history in December.

Former Enron CEO's Wife Says Scrutiny Is Fair, MSNBC Says
2002-01-28 11:32 (New York)

     Houston, Texas, Jan. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay's wife Linda said she understands why her husband is under scrutiny after the company he ran filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December, MSNBC reported, citing an interview on NBC's ``Today'' Show.
     ``I don't think it seems unfair,'' MSNBC quoted Linda Lay as saying. ``The buck stops at his desk. Absolutely. He is at the top. That is where it ought to be. If I were back there listening to all the things that were being said, I would absolutely have to say, `What is wrong here?' How can all of this be happening without someone doing something terribly evil?''
     Lay said she and her husband are ``fighting for liquidity'' and everything is for sale except their home, MSNBC reported.
     She said former Enron Vice Chairman John Clifford Baxter's suicide last week is a ``perfect example of how the media can play such havoc and destruction in people's lives.''
     ``This is a mass hysteria of who can get the news first on when, how, why, suspicion, and they're lumping everybody together,'' Lay said, according to MSNBC. ``Nobody really even knows what the truth is yet. The only truth I know for sure is that my husband is an honest, decent, moral human being who would do absolutely nothing wrong. That I know 100 percent.''

USA: Kenneth Lay's wife says ex-Enron CEO is honest man.
By Sue Pleming

01/28/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The wife of former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay defended her husband on Monday, saying he was an ""honest, decent, moral"" man who did nothing wrong in the devastating collapse of the energy trading giant. 
In an interview with NBC's ""Today"" show, Linda Lay said her husband, who quit as chairman and chief executive officer of Enron Corp. last week, had been grossly misunderstood and was victim of ""mass hysteria"" surrounding the biggest bankruptcy case in U.S. history.
""Nobody even knows what the truth is yet. The only thing I know, 100 percent for sure, is that my husband is an honest, decent, moral human being who would do absolutely nothing wrong. That I know 100 percent,"" she said. 
Linda Lay, whose five children also defended their father, said she could understand the anger and loss felt by Enron employees when they recalled her husband's publicly upbeat attitude toward the company before it dived. 
Much of the criticism of Lay has centered on mounting evidence he knew of the energy company's debt-ridden position even as he was advising his staff to buy Enron stock, which is now worthless. 
""If I were back there listening to all the things that were being said I would absolutely have to say, 'What is wrong here? How can all of this be happening without someone doing something terribly wrong?'"" Linda Lay said. 
But she said there were man things her husband had not been told that would come out in the many investigations now under way. 
""Those things will all come to light and that's what we're all praying for."" 
Congressional hearings began in Washington last week into Enron's fall and the role of its auditor, Big Five accounting firm Andersen. Legislators are very interested in the destruction of thousands of documents related to Enron audits. 
REALITY SET IN IT WAS OVER 
Linda Lay broke down as she recalled a couple of days before Enron collapsed when her husband came home from work and said he could not turn the company around. 
""He said he had tried everything he could think of and he could not stop it,"" she sobbed, adding: ""(He was) devastated, devastated for his employees."" 
Asked how she felt toward those who said her husband betrayed them, she replied, ""We've lost everything but I don't feel Ken has betrayed me. I'm sad, I'm desperately sad but I don't know where to place the anger. I don't know who to get mad at. I just know my husband did not have an involvement."" 
Like many of those affected by Enron's woes, Linda Lay said her own family was fighting for survival and that everything except their home was for sale. 
""We are fighting for liquidity. We don't want to go bankrupt,"" she said, adding that nearly all of their fortune had been locked into Enron stock, which is now worthless. 
According to a lawsuit filed in federal court in Houston, Lay received $101 million in proceeds from the sale of Enron stock between October 1998 and November 2001. 
The Enron saga took a tragic turn last Friday with the apparent suicide of J. Clifford Baxter, who had resigned as vice chairman of Enron Corp last year and who was said to have opposed the accounting practices of the company. 
Mrs. Lay said her family was devastated by Baxter's death, adding that her husband had spoken to him not too long ago. 
""Cliff was a wonderful man. It's a perfect example of how the media can play such havoc and destruction in people's lives. This is the ultimate. This is a loss of life."" 
""It makes my heart, it makes Ken's heart ache,"" she added. ""Had we known we would have picked up the phone and called him. We would have gone and been with him. We would have done anything we could to have helped him, helped his family but we had no idea he was in that kind of pain."" 
Lay came out of retirement last year to return to his old job as CEO. Asked how she would change her life, if given the chance, his wife said: ""Selfishly, probably that my husband never went back to Enron.""

Lay's wife says couple trying to avoid personal bankruptcy 
Associated Press 
Jan. 28, 2002, 9:06AM
The wife of former Enron Corp. chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said the couple is working to avoid personal bankruptcy. 
""Everything we had mostly was in Enron stock,"" Linda Lay told NBC's Today show today. 
""We've had long-term investments and those long-term investments have cash calls,"" she said. ""Virtually -- other than the home we live in -- everything we own is for sale."" 
She said her husband, who built a modest pipeline company into an energy giant, is an ""honest, decent, moral human begin who would do absolutely nothing wrong."" 
Kenneth Lay resigned last week as chairman and chief executive, though he remains on the Enron board. 
Linda Lay said the full truth isn't out about the Enron debacle, in which the nation's seventh-largest corporation crumbled into bankruptcy because of questionable accounting practices. 
""There's some things (Kenneth Lay) wasn't told,"" Linda Lay said. ""That will all come out in the investigation."" 
She said outside counsel, law firm Vinson & Elkins, and accounting firm Arthur Andersen LLC had told her husband everything was fine. 
Kenneth Lay had no idea former Enron executive J. Clifford Baxter -- who committed suicide -- was in some kind of pain, his wife said. 
Baxter was found dead Friday in his Mercedes-Benz, a few miles from his home in suburban Sugar Land. On Saturday, the Harris County Medical Examiner's Office confirmed Baxter killed himself. 
""It makes my heart ache, it makes Ken's heart ache,"" Linda Lay said. ""Had we known, we would have picked up phones and called -- we would have gone and been with him."" 
""If what he did had anything to do with what's been going on, it's a real tragedy,"" she said. 
Enron's collapse is the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Its downfall and accounting practices are being investigated by federal prosecutors, the FBI, securities regulators and 11 congressional committees and subcommittees.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- A group of former Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) employees has filed suit against the failed energy trader in Houston federal court seeking to regain lost savings. 
In a press release Monday, a group of 400 present and former employees, calling itself the Severed Enron Employees Coalition, or SEEC, filed action seeking to recover the ""staggering losses"" suffered by employees who contributed to Enron's 401(k) savings plan.
The group, which seeks to represent some 4,500 laid-off Enron employees, is banding together to focus ""on winning for disenfranchised Enron employees a greater voice in asserting claims resulting from Enron's bankruptcy,"" according to the prepared statement Monday.

Enron staffers contemplate future amid gloom 
`It's mostly about survival our own and the company's' 
By DAVID KAPLAN 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 28, 2002, 12:26AM
Every day, the scandal at Enron brings a new shock, with no letup in sight. 
The complex and jaw-dropping developments have even most jaded news consumers shaking their heads. 
Now, just imagine what it's like to still be working there. 
In the morning, the papers are full of disturbing news about your employer's business practices. At work, reporters are waiting outside the building. During the drive home, talk radio fills your ears with invective. At home, TV repeats the day's bad news and adds more. 
On Friday, Enron workers learned of the suicide of former company Vice Chairman Cliff Baxter, a member of upper management whom the employees admired. 
""The stress has gotten so bad on me, so intense and so sustained, my brain could no longer take it,"" said one Enron employee. 
He stopped watching and reading the news, because it had begun to affect him physically, though he knows he's missing out on information important to him. 
""I feel like I'm flying blind,"" he said. 
As might be expected, the mood at work is grim. Many wonder if Enron can somehow survive. If not, will the employees be left out in the cold? 
At this point, he said, ""it's mostly about survival -- our own and the company's."" 
Understandably, all those who spoke to the Chronicle asked to remain anonymous. 
In mid-October, when Enron reported big third-quarter losses and the Securities and Exchange Commission began its inquiry, one trader began to see in his colleagues' eyes ""a desolate, transparent, stare-out-in-space look."" 
""People were losing an enormous amount of money"" in stock holdings and 401(k)s, the trader said. 
By early November, when Dynegy announced its plan to buy Enron, employees were fearing for their jobs. Just before Thanksgiving, the apprehension intensified. The trader said he started getting 25 to 30 e-mails a day from people saying, ""If I'm not here tomorrow, here's my home phone number. In case you hear of a new group starting up, here's how you can get ahold of me."" 
Then came Black Monday, when 4,200 people were laid off. Those who didn't lose their jobs were nonetheless shocked and had a sense of mourning for their co-workers. 
Recalling that day, a woman who works in the pipeline group said she, too, wanted to stay at her desk with her head buried. 
""I felt guilt and hurt,"" she said. ""Now, I'm more depressed. You definitely don't want to be here anymore. Everyone I know has their r?sum?s out."" 
""There is probably a tremendous range of feelings,"" said Jonathan Kramer, a consulting and business psychologist and director of businesspsychologist.com, based in La Jolla, Calif. 
Some workers feel betrayed and angry, while others are depressed, scared about what's coming next, he said. 
""Certainly, it's got to be stressful for almost everyone,"" he said. 
Enron's downfall is hard on employees partly because they've been emotionally tied to the company. ""When it suffers, we suffer, too,"" Kramer said. ""It's a very demoralizing experience."" 
Employees may feel lucky that they didn't get laid off, Kramer said, but the overriding feeling is: Today, I have a job, but tomorrow I may not. 
One trader described his situation as ""a strange Catch-22: Hey, the only reason I'm being kept around is because I have physical inventory. The faster I move it, the faster I'm out of a job."" 
Traders don't have much to do, because there isn't much activity. In fact, said one employee, traders feel like they are part of the inventory, ""like they're being retained for the sole purpose of being part of a buyout package, like the software and hardware."" 
The people with ""the most skill and drive have banded together,"" he said. ""We're gonna take what's left of Enron and make something of it."" 
In the old days, there was immense pride, said one employee: ""We were the Harvard of corporations. But management has managed to tarnish that image. Each of us, instead of having a positive image on our r?sum?s from working here, now we may have something of a tarnished image ourselves."" 
They've gone from being envied to the butt of jokes. 
""We've talked about how embarrassing it is to work here,"" said one woman who works in the pipeline division. 
She said that whenever she has to fill out an application form somewhere, she wants to lie about where she works now. 
""We still have pride and still want to be with each other,"" she said. ""It's the executives we don't want to work for anymore."" 
She said Enron management was always secretive and is even more so now. 
""The communication we get is from news reports,"" she said. ""Enron only admits things when it comes out in the media. Wenever hear about what's going to happen until after it's happened."" 
""The effect of secrecy is devastating,"" said Scott Sindelar, a business psychologist based in Scottsdale, Ariz. ""It increases anxiety and anger and the likelihood of sabotage."" 
Sharing information is also the right thing to do ethically and from a business standpoint, Sindelar said. 
""You never know when you'll meet these same people along the road again,"" he said. 
It is best when you stay busy at work, one employee said, because then you don't think about everything. 
""You kind of don't bring certain things up, like the names of people who used to work here,"" she said, ""because it will kind of destroy the mood."" 
There are reminders, though. The names of laid-off workers are still on some desks and chairs. 
For the first time, the woman in the pipeline division sees divisions within the company. 
""We used to all feel like one close-knitted company, but now it's like the traders are everything and everyone else is expendable,"" she said. 
One employee said he felt no survivor's guilt about still having a job: ""People who work at Enron are savvy enough to realize that, hey, this is part of business. Nobody went behind closed doors to take somebody else's job away from them. It was just a luck of the draw."" 
Whenever there's news that a laid-off person got a job, ""it kind of lifts everybody,"" another employee said. 
With half its people gone, Enron's building has vast empty spaces, though the ones who are still there have been consolidated on certain floors. 
Still, one said he often rides the elevator alone, which never used to happen. 
In the halls, he has noticed a change in body language. 
""Shoulders are slumped,"" he said. ""The swagger is gone."" 

Crippled energy trader's workers consider futures amid gloom

HOUSTON (AP) - In the wake of America's largest bankruptcy ever, remaining employees at Enron Corp. can't help but wonder about their futures with the crippled energy trader. 
They were some of the thousands of employees and big and small investors around the country who lost fortunes in the company's plunging stock. And, even though they still have jobs, it's small consolation for some. They're grieving, apprehensive - even embarrassed.
""The stress has gotten so bad on me, so intense and so sustained, my brain could no longer take it,"" one Enron employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Houston Chronicle in Monday's editions. 
He's quit watching and reading the gloomy news, like former Enron company Vice Chairman Cliff Baxter's suicide, because it had begun to affect him physically. But he knows he's missing out on information that could be important to him. 
""I feel like I'm flying blind,"" he said, adding that when his future is at stake along with Enron's, ""it's mostly about survival - our own and the company's."" 
When Enron reported big third-quarter losses and the Securities and Exchange Commission began its inquiry in mid-October, an unidentified trader told the newspaper he began to see in his colleagues' eyes ""a desolate, transparent, stare-out-in-space look."" 
""People were losing an enormous amount of money"" in stock holdings and 401(k) plans, the trader said. 
Apprehension intensified by early November, when Dynegy announced its plan to buy Enron.

Fedl Judge Gives Enron 60 Days To Decide On Commodities
By Kathy Chu

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal judge will give bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) 60 days, or until April 2, to decide whether it wants to commit to five commodities contracts.
""Forcing an early decision to accept or reject could result in a loss of value to the estate,"" said Judge Arthur Gonzalez, during a Friday hearing at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York. 
With this ruling, the judge rejected motions by Enron's creditors - Natural Gas Pipeline of America, Trailblazer Pipeline Co., Southern California Gas Co., San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and Superior Industries International Inc. (SUP) - aimed at forcing the company to immediately decide upon the agreements. 
The creditors claim that since Enron's bankruptcy, the company hasn't fully honored its commitments. This has required third parties to step in to supply natural gas and electricity. 
But Judge Gonzalez told creditors Friday that their businesses haven't been significantly impaired by Enron's bankruptcy, as sufficient supplies of gas and electricity continue to be available. 
Also, Enron has said that its supply of the commodities to two California public utilities - Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. - as well as other creditors are nearing 100% of levels prior to the Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing.

Cheney refuses to release energy plan documents to Enron investigators 
GAO may bring rare lawsuit over refusal 
By KAREN MASTERSON 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
Jan. 28, 2002, 7:39AM
WASHINGTON -- In the face of political pressure to comply with congressional investigators, Vice President Dick Cheney said Sunday he will not release internal documents connected to the development of President Bush's energy plan. 
That refusal is expected to fuel political outcries that the administration is hiding information about its relationship with Enron Corp., and may prompt the General Accounting Office -- Congress' nonpartisan investigative arm -- to file a rare lawsuit against the White House. 
Cheney, who was asked on Sunday-morning news programs to defend his position, said White House attorneys looked into the matter and concluded that documents gathered by the task force he headed are protected by the rules of executive privilege. The GAO contends that U.S. taxpayers paid for the task force and have a right to the information. 
The GAO's jurisdiction ""extends to agencies created by statute. That's not me,"" Cheney said on Fox News Sunday. ""I'm a constitutional officer. The authority of the GAO does not extend in that case to my office."" 
Cheney showed no sign of compromising on the issue, and indicated he was unmoved by recent polls that showed a majority of Americans distrust the administration's relationship with Enron. 
Bush's comprehensive energy plan, released in May and subsequently passed by the Republican-controlled House, calls for more oil and gas drilling, particularly in the Alaskan wilderness, and a revival of the nuclear power industry. 
Democrats have since charged that the policies promoted in the plan were a payoff to industry executives, including Enron's, who had given generously to Bush's 2000 election campaign. For months, Democrats have demanded more details on who attended the meetings where the plan was forged and what was said. 
The collapse of Enron has complicated the administration's refusal to comply, and given Democrats a second opportunity to draw attention to those meetings. 
""The General Accounting Office is on solid ground in demanding that these records be turned over,"" Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation. ""The American people have a right to know what the facts are."" 
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., speaking on CNN's Late Edition, said Cheney's most recent refusal to cooperate ""raises more suspicions"" and suggests the White House may be hiding something. Lieberman chairs the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which is investigating certain aspects of the Enron debacle. 
Cheney, who was put on the defensive on two nationally televised programs, said the White House has nothing to hide. Rather, he said that by rebuffing the GAO's threat of legal action, the White House hopes to preserve the power of the presidency. 
On ABC's This Week, Cheney said that giving in to the GAO would put ""a chill over the ability of the president and vice president to receive unvarnished advice. ... It would make it virtually impossible for me to have confidential conversations with anybody."" 
But one Republican said the appearance of impropriety would grow as a consequence of not cooperating. 
""Unfortunately, as a result of Richard Nixon years ago, when anybody hears the term `executive privilege,' they assume something bad was going on,"" said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ""There's no evidence anything bad was going on here; there's not a scintilla of evidence that the administration was doing Enron's bidding."" 
But polls suggest the public doesn't need a causal link between campaign contributions and pro-Enron policies to distrust the process. In a newly released New York Times/CBS poll, a majority of those surveyed said they see Republicans as far more enmeshed in Enron's problems than Democrats. 
Only 17 percent of those polled said they thought the Bush administration was telling the truth; 58 percent said the administration was mostly telling the truth but hiding something, and 9 percent said officials were lying. 
In December, Enron, once ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 big businesses list, filed for the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. The company's collapse devastated retirement accounts, eliminated thousands of jobs and raised questions about Bush's close ties to the company and its former head, Ken Lay. 
And it gave Democrats an issue they hope to use against Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections. 
""The issue is not what they took, but what did Enron get,"" Terry McAuliffe, Democratic Party chairman, said on Late Edition. ""It seems clear that what they got is an energy policy, 17 different specific proposals that helped Enron."" 
McAuliffe was referring to a report issued by the head Democrat on the House Governmental Reform Committee, Rep. Henry Waxman of California, that suggested Enron's influence was evident in 17 measures included in the Bush policies. 
But Republicans have called the document a partisan attempt to create a scandal that does not exist. GOP leaders indicated Sunday that they will continue to deflect any hint of scandal by emphasizing that the criminal and congressional investigations of Enron are not yet complete. 
""The bottom line is, the president wants to understand all of the facts just as much as anyone else does,"" Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, Republican Party chairman, said on Late Edition. ""The administration does, and clearly Congress does. And I think that is what we ought to be focusing on.""

Did Andersen Speed Up the Shredding? Documents just released by a House subcommittee suggest the firm may have rushed its document destruction after learning of the SEC probe
By Mike McNamee in Washington

01/28/2002
BusinessWeek Online
(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

The Houston office of accountant Arthur Andersen may have accelerated its efforts to destroy Enron's audit records -- requiring staffers to work overtime -- after it learned the Securities & Exchange Commission was investigating Enron's accounting, documents released on Jan. 24 by a House Energy & Commerce subcommittee suggest. 
The documents -- e-mail messages obtained by BusinessWeek -- show that David B. Duncan, Andersen's lead partner on the Enron account, called a ""mandatory"" meeting on Oct. 23, 2001, ""to discuss the current events of Enron."" That was the day after Enron issued a press release disclosing the SEC had requested information about the accounting treatment of the partnership deals that ended up costing Enron $588 million in profit writedowns.
On Oct. 24, the day after the Andersen meeting, Kimberly H. Latham, an Andersen manager on the Enron account, instructed her staff to cooperate with efforts ""to insure that our team is in compliance with the Andersen documentation retention guidelines."" The staffer who Latham delegated to follow through was less politic: He referred to his task as a ""cleanup"" of computer files, and on Oct. 25 he gave his colleagues a list of computer directories ""that I would like you to clean out,"" according to the e-mails. 
REGARDING ""RETENTION."" While they're called ""retention guidelines,"" Andersen's rules regarding records actually call for disposing of documents on a regular schedule. According to Andersen officials, the firm keeps only the papers it deems to be essential to the audit. The guidelines contain exceptions -- including instructions that routine document disposal should cease when the firm learns of ""threatened or actual commencement of litigation, governmental, and/or professional investigations."" 
That makes the wording and timing of the e-mails significant. Congressional probers investigating the Enron affair believe the memos suggest that the destruction of records may have been a deliberate attempt to sweep away the history of the Enron audits. Andersen has acknowledged its Houston office destroyed thousands of documents relating to Enron, stopping only when the firm was subpoenaed by the SEC on Nov. 8. 
The computer files referred to in the Oct. 24 and Oct. 25 e-mails weren't yet subject to subpoena, but they appear to fall under Andersen's policies requiring a freeze when an audit is under investigation, the congressional probers believe. 
COVERING TRACKS? A House Energy & Commerce Committee subcommittee has subpoenaed Andersen officials, including Duncan and CEO Joseph Berardino, to testify about the shredding and discarding of documents. The panel has copies of the e-mails and is investigating them, says Ken Johnson, committee spokesman. ""This has all the outward appearance of people desperately trying to cover their tracks,"" Johnson says. 
After reviewing copies of the e-mails, an Andersen official said they back up the firm's contention that Duncan directed the shredding campaign. Andersen fired Duncan on Jan. 15 and put partner Thomas H. Bauer, who convened the Oct. 23 meeting with Duncan, on administrative leave. ""It's clear that David Duncan, a certified public accountant with full knowledge of an SEC investigation, ordered a full-scale document-destruction campaign,"" says the Andersen official, who spoke on the condition he not be named. ""That's consistent with what we found in our internal review."" 
Duncan's attorney could not be reached for comment. 
But the e-mails put the cleanup in the context of Andersen's document retention policies, which could pose problems for the firm. On Oct. 12, an Andersen attorney sent an e-mail to Houston reminding partners and managers of the need to keep up with disposal of outdated documents. Andersen has insisted the lawyer's reminder was routine and unrelated to Enron -- but that Duncan's directions to his staff were not. 
""DO WHAT IS NECESSARY."" Indeed, the e-mails present the cleanup as an urgent matter. In her Oct. 24 note, Latham told her staff that her supervisor ""expects everyone to do what is necessary to adhere to the guidelines. Obviously this should not interfere with client obligations...; however, we do expect that people will be able to do this on an overtime basis, if necessary, for the remainder of the week, or for however long it takes."" 
Contacted by BusinessWeek Online, Latham said she could not immediately comment on questions about her e-mails. 
The Andersen official says no action has been taken against Latham or her supervisor, partner Michael P. Schultz.

ENRON'S TROUBLES ENSNARE LEADING TEXAS LAW FIRM
DAVID KOENIG, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

01/28/2002
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
SOONER
A-5
(Copyright 2002)

Vinson & Elkins' reputation took 80 years to polish and one client to smudge. 
The largest law firm in Houston and the most profitable in Texas, Vinson & Elkins has been stung by accusations it showed poor judgment -- or worse -- in work for Enron Corp.
An Enron insider claims Vinson & Elkins blessed partnership deals that hid the energy trading company's shaky financial situation until it collapsed into bankruptcy. 
Outside lawyers say the firm violated ethical standards by reviewing the accusations itself instead of demanding an impartial, outside review. 
V&E has worked for Enron since the energy company's founding in the mid-1980s and Enron is now its biggest client, accounting for $35 million of its $450 million in billings last year. 
Vinson & Elkins' work for Enron might not have attracted much attention but for an Enron executive's letter written in August to chairman Kenneth Lay. 
The executive, Sherron Watkins, fretted that Enron could ""implode in a wave of accounting scandals,"" and urged the company to hire a law firm to investigate murky accounting and partnership deals that helped keep billions in debt off Enron's books. 
""Can't use V&E due to conflict -- they provided some true sale opinions on some of the deals,"" Watkins wrote. Lawyers write true sale opinions on the legality of transactions. 
Enron ignored Watkins' plea and turned back to Vinson & Elkins. In October, V&E partner Max Hendrick III wrote to Enron's general counsel James Derrick Jr., a former V&E partner, that Watkins' charges could prove embarrassing but merited no further investigation. 
A spokesman for Vinson & Elkins, Joe Householder, said the firm couldn't discuss its work for Enron because it still represents the company. 
Founded in 1917, the firm specialized in working with banks to provide legal advice and financing to Texas' then-young oil industry, and it grew rapidly as the energy sector boomed. 
Vinson & Elkins partners, who once included former Texas Gov. John Connally, grew rich. The law firm forged close ties with many Texas politicians, especially President Bush. 
But the firm also developed a progressive reputation for doing pro bono work on civil-liberties cases and for hiring female, black and Jewish partners in the 1970s, before many other Texas law firms did.

""Enron Is Just the Worst Example""; Billy Tauzin says his panel's probe has alerted him to ""real problems...in the structure of Corporate America""
Cohn writes for BusinessWeek in Washington

01/28/2002
BusinessWeek Online
(Copyright 2002 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

Billy Tauzin likes the spotlight. Last year, the Louisiana Republican, who chairs the House Energy & Commerce Committee, held high-profile hearings on the failure of network TV to call the 2000 Presidential results correctly on election night. Later, he honed in on the Ford Explorer/Firestone tire fiasco. And remember California's blackouts? He held hearings on that issue, too. 
Known as the ""Cagey Cajun"" on Capitol Hill, Tauzin's latest mission will be getting to the bottom of the rapid demise of Enron, the energy trader that became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in the nation's history on Dec. 2. And while his panel is one of several probing Enron, he has been first out of the box with hearings (see ""The Swamp Fox on Enron's Tail""). Tauzin has 15 of his staffers on the case, and so far they've collected 80 boxes of documents, interviewed several key officials at Enron and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, and traveled to Houston to dig up information on the company's home base.
On Jan. 18, Tauzin took time to talk with BusinessWeek Correspondent Laura Cohn about what he expects to emerge from his latest investigation and what policy changes might be needed. Here are edited excerpts from their conversation: 
Q: What are your expectations here? 
A: The first thing we have to do is, obviously, get the facts the best we can. We want to get a sense of what Enron was doing, how they were doing it, and what went wrong. Obviously, a lot of people got burned, and so we need to know why. We need to know the good, the bad, and the ugly. 
Q: Will people go to jail as a result of the Enron debacle? 
A: There may well be. [The] Justice [Dept.] would not be launching an investigation if there were not at least some possibility of criminal wrongdoing. We know there has been some document destruction. It may have all been innocent, it may have all been stupid, or it may have all been criminal. We just don't know yet. 
Q: Will there be policy changes as a result of this? 
A: Almost certainly. For a long time, I have defended the practice of accounting firms doing both the audit function and the consulting function [for the same client]. We'd assumed those functions could be conducted without the kind of conflicts of interest that may have been present here. We're learning differently. 
We're learning that maybe there are some problems here, maybe those rules need to be changed. We're going to most likely see some changes in the way in which the accounting rules are enforced and, in all probability, in the rules themselves. 
Q: In the past, you've been a big backer of the accounting industry, and you disagreed with former Securities & Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr.'s push to clamp down on conflicts of interest in the industry. Have you changed your view? 
A: Several years ago, when he was making the case, we didn't see evidence of the problem. Today, it's kind of hard to say there isn't evidence of a problem. Arthur Levitt was right. We need to make some changes. 
Q: What sort of changes? 
A: There's clearly a need for more disclosure. We're finding out that there are real problems endemic in the structure of Corporate America that we need to deal with. Enron is just the worst example that we're going to have to take into the lab and completely dissect in order to find out what went wrong. 
Q: I understand you're quite a hunter. What are you hunting these days? 
A: I'm on a deer hunt right now. I'm an avid fisherman, hunter, and outdoorsman. Whenever I get a break, I try to do that. 
Q: I understand you're quite a chef as well. 
A: Yeah. I don't hunt anything I can't cook, let me put it that way. My rule is if you take it, you cook it.

UK govt denies wrongdoing in connection with Enron, Arthur Andersen

01/28/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

LONDON (AFX) - Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman denied the government had committed any wrongdoing in connection with failed US energy group Enron Corp and its accountants Arthur Andersen. 
""We would refute absolutely that there has been any impropriety,"" he told reporters, after opposition Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Matthew Taylor called for an inquiry into the Labour Party's ""extremely close links"" with both Enron and Arthur Andersen.
The Labour government spokesman said: ""Yes, Enron representatives have met government ministers from the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) over the course of the years since the government came to power. 
""They are not alone in that and at some meetings they were there with representatives of other companies."" 
Taylor told BBC radio: ""Labour have chosen to build very close links with business on a pretty dubious basis where they have received money and help on the one hand from businesses benefiting very much from government policy on the other."" 
He added: ""We know that in the United States, Enron used extensive political contacts to seek to further its interests and there is good evidence of the same happening here in the UK."" 
Taylor said former Labour employees were taken on by Enron to lobby for a change in gas policy -- changes which were subsequently pushed through. He added that Enron may have curried favour at the time of its takeover of Wessex Water by paying for tables at the Labour Party conference. 
Taylor also called for an investigation into Labour's links with Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm which failed to spot the black hole in Enron's finances before its collapse late last year. 
Taylor said Arthur Andersen, which had been barred from doing business with previous UK governments for 12 years after being blacklisted for its work as auditor to failed carmaker De Lorean, had built very close links with the Labour Party since then. 
He said the accountants' ""free work"" for the Labour Party between 1992-1997 ""appears to have paid off, because just after the general election they were brought back into government business and have been absolutely at the centre of what has been happening in government since and with some very questionable reports that have backed the Labour government."" 
The current trade minister, Patricia Hewitt, was Andersen's head of research until the current Labour government came to power in 1997.

SEC's Top Cop Says Enron 'Not Going To Distract Us'
By Judith Burns

01/28/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

SAN DIEGO -(Dow Jones)- Investigation into the collapse of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) won't stop regulators from pursuing other cases, the top cop at the Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday.
""Enron's not going to distract us,"" SEC enforcement division director Stephen Cutler said at a Northwestern University legal conference here. He gave the usual disclaimer that his remarks reflect his own views, not those of the SEC. 
The SEC began investigating Enron last October, after the Houston energy company announced it had overstated four-and-a-half years of earnings. The SEC later expanded the probe to include document destruction by Enron's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen. A criminal investigation by the Justice Department also is under way, along with investigation by numerous congressional committees. 
""People may have a sense that all we care about is Enron,"" said Cutler. 
While he acknowledged the case is getting a lot of attention, he said it won't stop other SEC investigations in their tracks, and promised that in coming months, ""you'll be seeing lots of good cases from us."" 
Connections between SEC commissioners and accounting firms won't stop the agency from cracking down on accounting fraud, Cutler indicated. 
Some critics have questioned whether the SEC may adopt a softer touch on accountants given that Chairman Harvey Pitt represented accounting firms in his past law practice, and the newly named commissioner Cynthia Glassman worked for a Big Five accounting firm. 
""I think there's a misperception out there about this new commission and its willingness to be tough"" in fighting financial fraud, Cutler said. 
Accounting cases account for the bulk of the SEC's enforcement actions now. Last year, the agency brought more than 100 cases alleging financial fraud and in case, obtained a record $7 million settlement from Andersen for its role in auditing Waste Management Inc., another big accounting blowup. 
Cutler said the fine, the largest ever paid by a Big Five accounting firm, shows that in financial fraud cases, audit firms ""will be held accountable"" along with audit partners. 
Independence is another area getting close scrutiny from SEC attorneys, Cutler indicated. The SEC recently settled a case against KPMG that alleged it violated independence rules by investing in a mutual fund that was an audit client. 
""There will be other independence cases to come,"" Cutler added. He said the agency is concerned when a ""web of relationships"" or business deals might cloud an auditor's judgment or undermine independence.

DUESSELDORF (AFX) - UBS AG chief executive Peter Wuffli said the acquisition of Enron Corp's wholesale energy trading business will help the bank to level out earnings fluctuations, German newspaper Handelszeitung reported. 
In an interview with the newspaper, Wuffli said there is no correlation between profits from the energy trading business and the development of the capital markets.
Moreover, Wuffli said an acquisition of Enron's energy trading operation does not mean UBS intends to change its current risk limit structure.

INDIA: Gaz de France to bid for Enron with Indian partner.
By Himangshu Watts

01/28/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

DAHEJ, India, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Gaz de France would find a partner to bid jointly for Enron Corp's $2.9 billion power project in India, as it is only interested in the LNG portion of the project, an official of the French utility said on Monday. 
""Probably we would participate in the bidding with an Indian parter,"" Jacques Gautier, project director of Gaz de France, told reporters at the foundation stone laying ceremony of a LNG import terminal at the port of Dahej, Gujarat, on India's west coast.
So far six major companies - three foreign and three Indian - have expressed interest in bidding for the massive 2,184 MW Dabhol plant and LNG facility located about 250 km (155 miles) south of Bombay. 
The bidding process for the power plant and adjacent liquified natural gas (LNG) facility is expected to start later this week. 
In addition to Gaz de France, the potential foreign bidders are Royal Dutch/Shell and European oil major TotalFinaElf . The possible Indian bidders are private power utilities BSES Ltd , Tata Power Company , and Gas Authority of India . 
Gautier said Gaz de France was interested only in Dabhol's LNG facility and added the firm was discussing this with the Indian lenders to the power project. 
""We have no intention to enter the electricity market in India,"" Gautier said. 
Lenders led by India's Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) have made it clear that they intend to sell the facility as a whole, instead of accepting separate bids for the power plant and the LNG landing jetty and storage depot. 
But parties could form a consortium to bid jointly for the project and then split it up, lenders say. 
Gautier said if Gaz De France were successful in bidding for the LNG facility, it would find additional customers. Currently, Dabhol Power Co, the company set up to build and operate the plant, is the sole customer for the LNG facility. 
ESSENTIAL BACKGROUND 
The entire Dabhol facility has lain idle since June due to a dispute over the cost of power provided to its sole customer, a nearly bankrupt Indian state utility. 
The power plant was almost complete when construction on the 1,444 MW second phase was halted after the state electricity board fell $240 million behind in payments for power provided. The 740 MW first phase began operating in May 1999. 
Enron, the Houston-based energy trader which collapsed late last year, becoming the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, owns a 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power Co. 
General Electric Co and U.S.-based contractor Bechtel Corp each own 10 percent, and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) the remaining 15 percent. 
Gaz de France owns 10 percent of Petronet LNG import terminal at Dahej. The remainder is owned by four Indian state-run oil and gas companies and Qatar's Ras Laffan Liquified Natural Gas Co.

A year of good luck.
By SWAMINOMICS/SWAMINATHAN S ANKLESARIA AIYAR.

01/28/2002
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2002 The Times of India

Republic Day is an occasion for ruminating on events of the past year. We can hardly claim that it was a year of good political or economic management. Yet India ended the year a clear winner because good luck overcame the losses caused by poor management. 
The two major strokes of luck both related to events in America. One was the bombing of the World Trade Centre last September. President Bush declared war on terrorism. He forced Pakistan to turn against the Taliban and ban the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad. This laid the ground for President Musharraf to declare war on jehad and call for a new secular Pakistan. This is an astonishingly favourable turn of events for India. We could never have achieved it through the most astute political or diplomatic stratagems. It fell into our laps like manna from heaven. Osama bin Laden, thanks very much.
On the economic side, the biggest mess continues to be non-reform of the power sector. This was exemplified in Maharashtra's refusal to buy power at the contracted rate from the Dabhol plant of Enron. Many questions have been raised about the Dabhol contract in the past, but all efforts to establish corruption have failed, and the contract was anyway revised to rectify supposed shortcomings. 
From the viewpoint of the global business, Maharashtra was guilty of wilful default, and India's name became mud to global investors. All other foreign power companies operating in India decided to quit because the mind-set of other state governments was not materially different from Maharashtra's. The culture of non-payment in the sector is deeply entrenched: The state electricity boards have payment arrears of a whopping Rs 40,000 crore, as much as the GNP of many developing countries. And then manna fell from the heavens again. 
In the US, Enron collapsed with lightning speed in the last quarter of 2001, amid accusations of fudged accounts, collusion with auditors, and attempts to fool investors and lenders. In the case of Dabhol, Americans saw Enron as a victim and India as an oppressor. But after its collapse in December, Enron's image became that of an oppressor. Indeed, the word Enron has now become part of the English language as a synonym for lying and swindling. A US Senator said the other day that he would not allow the US president to do an Enron to the tax bill. 
Now, the Enron scandal in the US had nothing to do with its Dabhol operation. At Dabhol, Maharashtra accused Enron of making exorbitant profits. But the accusation in the US was the very opposite, that Enron lost huge sums in foreign ventures like Dabhol and then cooked its books to keep its losses and debts off its books. The company collapsed when the truth came to light. 
From the US viewpoint, the scandal was not that Enron made too much profit from infrastructure investments abroad, but too heavy losses, and so had to dress up its balance sheet. Yet Enron has got such a bad name in the process that this has let Maharashtra (and India) off the hook. It is a classic case of India's gross mismanagement being offset by sheer good luck. 
The story on the political side is much the same. Atal Behari Vajpayee started 2001 with strong talk about Pakistani perfidy at Kargil, saying it was pointless to start a dialogue with Pakistan unless it foreswore support to militants in Kashmir. Pakistan did not oblige. 
Yet Vajpayee then did a U-turn and invited Musharraf for a summit at Agra. There was much excitement at the possibility of a breakthrough. But Vajpayee bungled the negotiation, was outmanoeuvred by Musharraf in the drafting of an Agra Declaration, and suffered the ignominy of having the draft shot down by his own Cabinet colleagues. Agra ended with Musharraf in high spirits, having got the better by far of the exchange. 
Yet within months bin Laden struck at New York, and President Bush declared war on international terrorism. Suddenly the Agra fiasco no longer mattered. The US obliged Pakistan to disown first the Taliban and then all terrorist groups including those it had used as its storm troopers in Kashmir, like the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad. Vajpayee's mismanagement at Agra was more than offset by his good luck. 
A famous story tells how Napoleon chose a leading general for the French Army. The credentials of one candidate were explained to him at great length. That's all very well, said Napoleon, but is he lucky? Napoleon, it seems, would have regarded Vajpayee as a good candidate. 
Yet history proves that good luck soon runs out. Pakistan is a case in point. Under General Ayub Khan in the 1960s it ran a successful economy, and its GDP growth was much faster than India's. But after he fell, economic mismanagement and corruption grew. Yet Pakistan thrived for another two decades because of luck. 
The loss of its eastern wing in 1971 was a political disaster, but an economic boon: It got rid of most of its poor and raised average living standards. Then came the oil crisis of 1973, which initially seemed bad luck. But it created a huge demand for Pakistani labour, and soon remittances from Pakistanis in the Gulf became the country's biggest export, papering over its growing failure in other export sectors. Luck seemed to be running out when General Zia turned Islamic, and the US cut off foreign aid. But good luck returned with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This fetched Pakistan massive foreign aid. 
But its run of good luck ended with the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. After that, Pakistan has gone from one financial crisis to another, a beggar in thrall to the IMF. That holds a lesson for India. Good luck has saved our bacon in 2001. But we need in the coming year to depend on good management rather than good luck. Otherwise we too will go the Pakistan way.

News - International - Americans `do not believe the White House'.
By Toby Harnden.

MORE than two thirds of Americans believe that the Bush administration is hiding something or lying about its relationship with Enron, according to a CBS-New York Times poll. 
Although no allegations of wrongdoing have been made against the White House, the poll underlined the potential political damage to Mr Bush by the collapse of Enron, a major contributor to his election campaign. Dick Cheney, the vice-president, yesterday refused to release a list of business leaders he met while formulating energy policy, saying that it would be ""unprecedented"".
Congressional investigators have insisted that he should be compelled to disclose the information and his refusal may add to suspicions of a cover-up.

Energy Trading: Still Thriving: Enron could become what Drexel was to junk market that survived it
Christopher O'Leary (christopher.oleary@tfn.com)

01/28/2002
Investment Dealers Digest

Despite the ever-lengthening woes of Enron Corp., whose stock has been delisted and whose chief executive has just resigned, the energy trading market that Enron essentially put on the map surprisingly has been thriving. 
Many market players initially had been wary that the Enron scandal, which has been a regular fixture of newspapers and television for the last two months, would sully the whole concept of energy deregulation and the trading of such esoteric properties as energy and weather derivatives. Some feared Enron rivals would be sitting in bankruptcy courts if the market entirely fell apart.
Yet so far, despite all the angry editorials and ominous Congressional speeches about the practice of energy trading, the market has performed without a hitch. The scandal ""has not destroyed the industry that Enron had a role in establishing-the energy derivatives market is still in good shape and even credit derivatives seem to have come out well,"" said John McCormack, a senior vp and head of the energy practice at Stern, Stewart & Co. ""It's a great tragedy for Enron shareholders, but it's not had tremendous impact on the overall industry."" 
For some energy players, Enron's collapse has been the chance of a lifetime to build market share and win business. Sources estimate about six to a dozen players are now working like mad to win over former Enron clients and fill in the vacuum left behind by the once-colossal company. Those players include Dynegy Inc., which very nearly bought Enron late last year, El Paso Corp., Williams Cos., Koch Energy Trading, Reliant Resources Inc. and Sempra Energy, the holding company of San Diego Gas & Electric. 
In addition, the scandal hasn't apparently scared off the Street either. While Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, the two banks most directly tied to Enron, have understandably been not visible in recent months, sources said, many of their rivals have been busy. UBS Warburg, which now owns Enron's trading operations, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Goldman Sachs are among the banks looking for new opportunities. While there will likely be fewer big-ticket mergers this year, the companies that most benefit from Enron's absence could gain market share and be in an optimum position to pounce on rivals. 
Nor has the day-to-day business of energy trading been greatly affected. Much energy trading that had been conducted through such avenues as Enron's proprietary online system has moved to such places as the New York Mercantile Exchange or the Intercontinental Exchange. 
Yet bankers noted that despite the apparent calm in the energy trading market, some fundamental changes are occurring. McCormack noted a ""growing skepticism that now greets any mention of special-purpose entities,"" the type of off-balance-sheet devices that Enron officials used essentially to disguise their company's bleeding. ""The call for transparency is much higher. I think companies are now erring on the side of more and not less disclosure,"" he said. 
At the end of the day, the ultimate fate of energy trading is still up in the air, though at least for the short-term, the market has survived and even prospered. Rather than being the market's cause of death, Enron is instead seen by some players as an equivalent to Drexel Burnham Lambert. Like Enron, Drexel came to embody and master its particular niche, high-yield bond underwriting; like Enron, Drexel spectacularly fell from grace. Yet high yield went on to become an established wing of structured finance, and bankers believe energy trading is on its way to permanence as well.

Enron's Web site shows irony of a ruined regime --- In virtual world, everyone's smiling and all's well for discredited company

U.S. Senate staffers moving back into anthrax-decontaminated offices last week are passing around a grim joke: ""We have to evacuate again. They found traces of Enron in the air vents."" 
For Enron, it's fair to say, things are going from awful to horrible. The visionary company has become the butt of wisecracks, the prey of plaintiffs' lawyers, the target of countless investigators.
The U.S. Congress and the FBI are doggedly pursuing document shredders. Enron chairman (and friend of all elected Washington) Kenneth L. Lay has resigned, explaining drolly that multiple investigations ""currently require much of my time."" The company's dwindling workforce is job-hunting and suing to recover vanished retirement funds. 
Yet, in the virtual world of Enron's Web site, the outlook is far, far brighter. 
""It's difficult to define Enron in a sentence,"" says a welcome message that, like so much at enron.com, is intriguing in a way its authors never anticipated. ""It's difficult, too, to talk about Enron without using the word 'innovative.' Most of the things we do have never been done before. We believe in the economic benefits of open, competitive wholesale markets, and we play a leading role in creating them. No wonder Fortune surveys have named Enron the most innovative company in America for six years in a row."" 
There's a winning streak that may be endangered. 
Clicking through Enron's Web site today is like touring the half-ruined palace of some vanquished regime that imagined its reign would never end. Everywhere there are ironic reminders of the glory that was, or at least was claimed. 
Like the hundreds of pairs of shoes the Philippines' first lady Imelda Marcos left behind when she fled the presidential mansion or the gaudy sculptures left in Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's gargantuan palace, they are a bracing reminder of the dangers of hubris and the fleeting nature of human triumph. 
True, here and there on enron.com you can find indications that all is not well: Above the speeding bicyclist on the opening page is a link to ""Information for Former Enron Employees Affected by Chapter 11 Filing."" But most of the site - as of Thursday - remained cheerfully intact. 
Everyone's still smiling as they bustle about the new economy. Shirt-sleeved managers introduce Web slide shows to explain the intricacies of weather derivatives and bandwidth trading. The slightly blurred, bright colour photos give the impression of a company going places. 
In the ""Most Requested"" section, you can jump to ""Corporate Responsibility,"" where you will learn that the company is ""dedicated to the highest professional and ethical standards."" 
Employees and shareholders who feel they were fleeced may be surprised to read the details: ""We treat others as we would like to be treated ourselves. We do not tolerate abusive or disrespectful treatment. Ruthlessness, callousness and arrogance don't belong here. We work with customers and prospects openly, honestly and sincerely. When we say we will do something, we will do it; when we say we cannot or will not do something, then we won't do it."" 
The bottom line in Enron's ""Vision and Values"" statement: ""The great fun here will be for all of us to discover just how good we can really be."" 
Or check out the Letter to Shareholders from the 2000 Annual Report: ""At a minimum, we see our market opportunities companywide tripling over the next five years. Enron is laser-focused on earnings per share, and we expect to continue strong earnings performance."" 
""If you're on irony watch, this is the place,"" says Steve Baldwin, a Yonkers, N.Y., Web writer, as he surfs the Enron site. 
Brewster Kahle, a computer pioneer and director of the Internet Archive (archive.org), an online collection of old Web pages of all kinds, says the deceptive nature of Web sites extends far beyond the corporate world. 
""On the Web, everything always looks brand-spanking new,"" says Kahle, of San Francisco. ""The question is, can I trust it? If companies go under, their Web sites can just live on and on."" 
You can ride the Wayback Machine at Kahle's archive, named for a time-travel device in the old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons, back to Web sites that have long been off-line. 
At taleban.com, you can study the public relations messages the ousted Afghan regime put out to the world in 1999: ""The case is often made that Osama bin Laden is living in Kandahar under the administration of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. However the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has moved him to Kandahar to keep him under strict limitations. He is no longer allowed to use Afghan soil to cause harm to any country."" 
'Most of the things we do have never been done before. We believe in the economic benefits of open, competitive wholesale markets, and we play a leading role in creating them.""Ruthlessness, callousness and arrogance don't belong here. We work with customers and prospects openly, honestly and sincerely.'

Enron: even the grammar is bankrupt

It was inevitable: Enron the verb, Enron the adjective. 
The bankrupt energy company's past imperfect behaviour has given us licence to use Enron as something other than a noun in our daily language.
It happens all the time: O.J. Simpson's flight from justice became ""doing an O.J,'' just as Monica Lewinsky's Oval Office hijinks begat ""getting Lewinskyed.'' 
From Watergate to Whitewater to Enron's dramatic collapse, words that are pop-culture milestones invariably enter the popular vernacular in various forms. 
Enron, justifiably, is today's hottest co-opted word. 
In a recent debate on the U.S. Senate floor, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle compared the financial scandals surrounding Enron to Bush's budget and tax policies: ""I think that we are slowly ""Enronizing'' the economy, Enronizing the budget,'' he said. 
In a New York Times story on the demise of Tina Brown's Talk magazine, media critic Michael Wolff said of Brown: 
""This is no ordinary failure. She staked everything and was wiped out. She's a little Enron ish.'' 
Get it? Now try it yourself: ""The Enronization of our country.'' ""My company Enroned me.'' ""He handled our accounts Enronishly.''

IN THE MONEY: Another Sign Investors Don't Trust Enron
By Michael Rapoport

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp. (ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock.
Enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value. 
That's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly. 
First, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders. 
This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash. 
Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form. 
But given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios. 
And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.) 
When you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come? 
That's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level. 
An Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. 
It's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy.

Dynegy Board Silent On Status Of Enron Takeover >ENE DYN
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As the market continues to speculate about the status of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) takeover of Enron Corp. (ENE), Dynegy's board isn't offering its opinion. 
""Any comments coming out of Dynegy are coming from the company's executives,"" said Jerry Johnson, a Dynegy board member who also is an executive vice president at Safeguard Scientifics Inc. (SFE).
Johnson declined to comment on any matters related the pending acquisition of its larger rival, and wouldn't say whether the board has been meeting to discuss the transaction. 
Three other board members, through their representatives, declined to comment as well. Other non-executive directors on the 14-member board either weren't immediately available to comment or couldn't be reached. 
As for Dynegy's management, spokesman John Sousa said the company's opinion on the deal remains the same since its last comments on Wednesday. 
At that time, Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said Dynegy was continuing its due diligence and was looking to accelerate regulatory approval of the deal. 
According to Sousa, Dynegy worked through the holiday weekend gathering information as part of its due diligence efforts. 
Meanwhile, Enron continued its discussions to raise between $500 million to $1 billion of additional financing, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. The company also is working to restructure its debt by mid-December, she said. 
But investors appear to be voting with their feet. Enron shares were recently down 18.3%, or 86 cents, to $3.85, while Dynegy shares slipped 2.7%, or $1.06, to $39.34. As a result, the already huge discount to the deal's offer price has grown even bigger as the market continues to signal the deal won't get completed on its original terms. 
Under the terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each share outstanding, or about $8.98 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
At Enron's recent level, the stock is trading at a 64% discount to the Dynegy offer. 
Neither Sousa or Denne would comment on the stock movement. 
Dynegy has already provided Enron with a $1.5 billion cash infusion that is secured by Enron's pipeline assets. While that investment has helped Enron's near-term liquidity position, it remains unclear how long the company can remain solvent without any added investments.

Enron, Banks Formalize $690M Debt Extension To Dec. 14
By Carol S. Remond and Christina Cheddar

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service

Of Dow Jones Newswires 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) and a group of banks last week formalized an agreement to extend the due date on a $690 million syndicated loan by three weeks to Dec. 14.
The loan relates to one of Enron's consolidated limited partnerships that owns minority interests in power and energy projects around the world. Enron said last week that Standard & Poor's downgrade of its credit rating to ""BBB-"" had triggered an obligation to repay the loan by Nov. 27. 
People familiar with the matter said last week that lead banks J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. and Enron will use the extension to negotiate a further postponement of the debt to the middle of 2002 when other Enron bank loans come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be restructured. 
About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the outstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, those people familiar with the matter said. 
Enron's shares and bonds continue to suffer from mounting uncertainties about the company's finances and whether those could force one-time rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN) to reconsider its offer to buy Enron, an offer that many see as Enron's only chance to avoid bankruptcy. Enron stock was recently down 18% to $3.84. Meanwhile, Enron bonds are also lower, with the 6.4% bonds due 2004 recently trading at a distressed level of 48 cents on the dollar.

Citigroup Has $2.38B Less To Lose On Enron Due To Swaps
By Christine Richard
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/26/2001
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Citigroup Inc. (C) is expected to extend a hand to Enron Corp. (ENE) by renegotiating a $690 million payment due Nov. 27. 
But investors shouldn't be concerned that the financial services giant is too exposed to the embattled energy trading company. Citigroup already may have laid off the loan and other exposure via a series of credit default swap transactions. That means more institutional investors left holding the bag if Enron isn't ultimately rescued from financial collapse by a takeover proposed by Dynegy Inc. (DYN).
Over the last few years, Citigroup has entered into at least six transactions that effectively would allow the bank to lay off the equivalent of $2.384 billion in Enron exposure. 
Citigroup was instrumental in setting up Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust, Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust II and Yosemite Securities Trust I, which together raised $1.750 billion; Enron Sterling Credit Linked Notes Trust and Yosemite Securities Co., which raised a combined GBP325 million; and Enron Euro Credit Linked Notes Trust, which issued EUR200 million. 
Citigroup, which acts as the default swap counterparty to the trusts, receives the return on the portfolio of single-A-plus-or-better-rated securities, purchased with the proceeds of the offerings, in exchange for providing the payout on the Enron exposure, according to Mary Ryan, director of synthetic securities ratings at Standard & Poor's. 
As long as Enron remains out of bankruptcy, Citigroup continues to make payments on the notes, Ryan said. 
If Enron defaults, Citigroup would cease making payments to the trust. The single-A-plus-or-higher-rated securities in the trusts would go to Citigroup in exchange for the same nominal amount of now in-default Enron debt obligations. And with speculation mounting that Dynegy will reduce, or maybe even scrap, its offer to buy Enron, the chances of a such a default-driven transfer would appear to be rising. 
These notes essentially are synthetic Enron debts, meaning they act like Enron bonds in many respects, but lack key components that make holders true creditors of Enron. 
For instance, the holders of these notes, because they don't possess actual Enron obligations - and won't unless the company defaults - are not involved in negotiations to restructure or rollover debt. It has been reported that Enron is engaged in active negotiations over the terms of its debts with creditors. 
The synthetic notes all carry a rating equivalent to Enron's rating of triple-B-minus from Standard & Poor's and Baa3 from Moody's Investors Service. 
The rating on the securities has been downgraded in recent weeks to reflect the downgrades in Enron's ratings. 
Citigroup officials did not respond to requests for further details on the transactions. -By Christine Richard, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2189;

Enron Is Sued Over 401(k) Plan; Plaintiffs Seek $850M

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) was sued Monday in the latest of at least three purported employee class action suits the company faces over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of the price of Enron stock. 
In a press release Monday, Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington, D.C. attorney who filed the latest suit on behalf of employees, said it seeks $850 million in plan losses, in part because the company sold Enron stock to its employees knowing the price was artificially inflated.
An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Unlike two similar, recently filed suits against Enron, the latest also contends that Enron offered the stock without the required prospectus. 
If proven, the sale without a prospectus ""give workers the automatic right to rescind their purchases and receive their money back with interest,"" Gottesdiener said in a statement. 
Enron ""locked down"" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19, to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed amid growing disclosures of financial problems. 
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. (DYN) offered to buy its far larger competitor in an all-stock deal that values Enron shares at $10.85 a piece, or about $9.2 billion. 
Enron later disclosed that its future earnings would be substantially less than expected and shares fell sharply. 
Enron currently trades at $4.05 a share, down from their 52-week high of $84.88 a share in December 2000. 
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plaintiffs by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP in Houston. A second was filed last week by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP.

STOCKWATCH Enron falls 14 pct on mounting concerns over Dynegy deal

11/26/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down 14 pct in midsession trading as concerns continued to mount over the energy giant's acquisition by Dynegy Inc, with investors focusing more and more on the deal's breaking clause, dealers said. 
At 12.45 pm, Enron shares were trading down 65 cents at 4.06 usd, a decline of 14.0 pct. Dynegy was down 1.60 usd at 38.80, amid broad declines in energy shares as crude prices sank.
The DJIA was up 57.70 points at 9,892.86. The S&P 500 was up 6.24 points at 1,143.27. The Nasdaq composite was up 11.94 points at 1,886.99. 
Dealers said that with Enron shares having slid well below the Dynegy offer price of 9.85 usd a share, the ChevronTexaco affiliate may well reconsider its offer, or walk away from the deal all together. 
""People are making the bet that perhaps Dynegy may cancel the deal, and that's there a lot more risk in playing the arbitrage,"" said Jefferies & Co market strategist Art Hogan. 
The deal with Dynegy contains a ""material adverse change"" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off, he said. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
Enron shares have plunged further since the filing, in which Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27. 
Enron subsequently received an extension on the repayment until mid-December. 
Since the beginning of the year, Enron shares have lost over 90 pct of their value after it was revealed that the company would post hefty third-quarter charges linked to risky investments by the firm's former chief financial officer. 
""At this point, with so much smoke around the fire, I think the shares are rightly valued,"" said Jefferies' Hogan.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron shares slide lower as merger doubts intensify.
By Janet McGurty

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Shares of troubled energy giant Enron Corp. continued to lose ground on Monday amid fears that the proposed acquisition of the company by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. will fall through. 
Enron stock was down 61 cents, or 12.9 percent, at $4.13 in active midmorning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy has agreed to pay $10.55 per share for Enron.
""The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms,"" said Michael Heim, an industry analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons. 
Heim said that among three possible scenarios - the deal goes through as planned, it is canceled, or it is restructured - the first is the least likely. 
""Escape clauses"" built into the Dynegy-Enron deal give the buyer the option to back out if there is serious deterioration in Enron's business or assets. 
""Dynegy has a good claim that the 'material adverse condition' clause has already been triggered, either by the $690 million loan being accelerated, earnings (being) down or the ongoing trading business weakness,"" he said. 
Last week Enron said it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt this week because of a credit downgrade, but the payment deadline has been delayed until mid-December. 
Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability. Continued lower volumes there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy. 
""Every day that goes by where Enron trading volumes become less, it decreases the value of the assets Dynegy was trying to buy in the first place,"" Heim said. ""Besides trading and marketing, what value does Enron have?"" 
The majority of Enron's physical assets are spoken for, with partnerships and creditors getting first dibs and Dynegy getting the first right to exercise its option to acquire Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline. 
Dynegy, which is 26.5 percent-owned by energy giant ChevronTexaco , is to swap 0.2685 share of its own stock for each share of Enron. Shares of Dynegy were down $1.27, or 3.1 percent, at $39.13 in midmorning NYSE trade. 
Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-sheet dealings by its officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cuts in its credit ratings. 
Enron subsequently restated its earnings, but investor unease snowballed and its share began tumbling. The shares were above $90 in August 2000. 
Heim said he was not sure that EnronOnline, Enron's online trading platform, is the premier property it once was. 
""Two years ago it had some value, but now others have been able to duplicate it. It's not the computer systems - it's the traders and network that Enron had. If those go away, the value lessens.

USA: Enron lawsuit seen as wake-up call for pensions.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - A Washington, D.C., lawyer said Monday he hopes heavy losses suffered by Enron Corp. employees will spur Congress to limit employee investments in their employers' stock through 401 (k) retirement plans. 
""How many workers have to lose both their jobs and their retirement savings before Congress steps in and puts a stop to this by placing a cap on the amount of company stock that can be in a 401 (k) plan?"" lawyer Eli Gottesdiener asked.
Gottesdiener released a statement Monday saying he had filed a lawsuit on behalf of employees of the beleaguered energy giant who have lost an estimated $850 million on Enron stock held in their 401 (k) retirement accounts. 
The suit is the third one filed against Enron that alleges the company breached its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its stock at artificially inflated prices. All three suits seek class-action status. 
Enron's shares have fallen from a high of $90 in August 2000 to less than $5 today, their decline accelerating since Oct 16 amid a series of disclosures about its deteriorating finances. 
Like many other companies, Enron makes matching contributions to its employees' 401 (k) retirement accounts in its own stock. It also requires them to hold the stock they receive in matching contributions until they turn 50. 
Enron employees were also prevented from selling Enron stock held in retirement accounts for several weeks from mid-October due to a change in the retirement plan's administrator. 
Gottesdiener said investment advisors recommend investing no more than 15 percent of a portfolio in a single stock, but that participants in 401 (k) plans offering employer stock as a choice typically hold 33 percent of their portfolio in that stock. 
""Congress sensibly placed a 10 percent limit on company stock in traditional defined benefit plans back in 1974, but at the behest of the corporate lobby, it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans,"" he said. 
The absence of such a cap in defined-contribution 401 (k) plans was ""completely indefensible,"" he said. 
Gottesdiener's suit alleges that Enron violated federal securities law by offering and selling Enron stock to employees without issuing a prospectus. If proven, this would give workers the right to reverse their purchases, he said. 
Gottesdiener is also involved in class action pensions litigation against New York Life Insurance Co. and SBC Communications Inc..

USA: US Corp Bonds-Bonds tighten, analysts fret on Enron.

By Jonathan Stempel 
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bonds outperformed
Treasuries on Monday as traders edged back to their desks 
following the Thanksgiving Day weekend, in the midst of a broad 
revival for corporate bonds of all stripes. 
In secondary trading, spreads, the yield difference between 
the bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries, tightened about 
0.01 percentage point. 
""I would expect a continuation of the tightening, especially 
with Treasury interest rates going up,"" said one trader. ""Absolute 
corporate yields are starting to look pretty attractive."" 
Corporate bonds, especially junk bonds, have outperformed 
Treasuries this month as investors developed a new tolerance for 
risk. Though absolute returns for investment-grade corporate bonds 
are negative, they are even worse in the Treasury market, where 
investors appear more convinced that the current U.S. economic 
downturn won't be deep or long. 
""The successes in Afghanistan and some milder-than-anticipated 
economic data have combined to increase investor appetite for 
risk,"" wrote fixed-income research service CreditSights Inc. in a 
report dated Monday. ""While the severity and swiftness of the bond 
market's correction was a surprise, it hasn't changed our basic 
view of U.S. corporate bonds and we continue to recommend 
overweight positions."" 
This week's forward calendar remains quiet. 
In early trading, 10-year Treasuries rose 10/32, as their 
yields fell to 4.971 percent. 
ENRON 
Market participants are closely watching Houston-based Enron 
Corp. as the largest U.S. energy trader tries to merge 
with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. , keep its 
investment-grade credit ratings, and manage a load of $9.15 
billion of debt and other obligations, much of which is unsecured 
and coming due within 13 months. 
Of this debt amount, $690 million could come due by 
mid-December, and $3.9 billion immediately if Enron falls to junk 
status. The key to resolution of this matter, some observers 
believe, is Enron's banks. 
""The goal of the banks now is to re-cut their exposure to gain 
as much structural seniority or asset liens as possible, take out 
fees, raise rates, take down total exposure, and generally improve 
their risk-profile under multiple scenarios,"" said CreditSights. 
""The very bankers who are supplying liquidity through new 
secured bank lines and who are rumored to be considering equity 
investments are the ones on the hook (and unsecured) for $3 
billion in bank loans,"" wrote Carol Levenson, an analyst for 
GimmeCredit, another fixed-income research service. ""If Dynegy 
backs out (in the interest of self-preservation), these vital bank 
renegotiations might save Enron but leave unsecured bondholders as 
the patsies."" 
Enron's existing 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 
percent notes maturing in 2009 were bid on Friday at 57 cents on 
the dollar, down from around par on October 12, before Enron first 
reported third quarter results, which it later revised downward. 
Enron shares have fallen 94 percent this year to their lowest 
level since early 1989. 
DATA 
Investment-grade and junk bond spreads narrowed 0.1 and 0.27 
percentage point last week, respectively, to 1.68 and 7.84 
percentage points, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. Junk bond 
spreads have narrowed 1.45 percentage points this month. 
For the month, junk bonds have returned 2.996 percent, while 
investment-grade corporate bonds have lost 2.355 percent and 
Treasuries 3.488 percent, Merrill Lynch said. For the year, the 
respective bonds are up 4.777, 9.634 and 6.565 percent.

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders' Perfect Storm Stalls
By Christina Cheddar

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This story was published originally Friday) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here's one 2001 outlook that couldn't have been more wrong.
Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting ""the perfect storm"" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy trading business one to watch in 2001. 
Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That was followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices were headed down, not up. 
And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE). 
Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high gas prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters. 
The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about where traditional utilities trade. 
And the chance for recovery in 2002? 
Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is willing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is currently between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of time before the stocks get there. 
""They were just recovering from Gray Davis,"" Mullick said, referring to the governor of California, who had accused ""out-of-state"" energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the state's energy crisis. ""Now, they are recovering from Enron."" 
The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group. 
""Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates,"" he said. ""I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety utility."" 
Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategies and financial disclosures. 
Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create. 
Answers Elude Investors 

Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want. 
Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. 
Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. 
Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. 
Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. 
""All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not,"" he said. 
He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. 
At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. 
Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. 
Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. 
Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). 
According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. 
""We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are,"" O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens. 
As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O'Brien. 
""One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays,"" O'Brien said. 
That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall.

INDIA: UPDATE 1-India's AV Birla group denies bid for Enron unit.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
(Recasts with denial, comments from financial institution in paragraphs 5-6) 
BOMBAY, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The Aditya Vikram Birla Group, a leading Indian conglomerate, on Monday denied newspaper reports it was looking to buy U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's 65-percent stake in the beleaguered Dabhol Power Company.
""There has been no expression of interest in Dabhol. We are not interested,"" a top AV Birla group official told Reuters. 
Two leading Indian business dailies earlier said the group, whose interests range from textiles to cement and carbon black, is eyeing Dabhol to expand its interests in the domestic power sector. 
The Economic Times and the Financial Express said the group was exploring the possibility of submitting an expression of interest to Indian financial institutions to buy Enron's stake in the company. 
An official of state-run Industrial Development Bank of India, the leading financier of the $2.9 billion project in the western state of Maharashtra, said he has not heard from the Birla group. 
""We have not received any official communication from them,"" the official, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters. 
The spokesman for Dabhol was not available for comment. 
FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL 
Enron Corp, which is fighting for survival in the United States amidst investor doubts over its corporate governance practices, owns 65 percent of Dabhol. General Electric Co and Bechtel own 10 percent each, while the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) owns 15 percent. 
Dabhol and MSEB have been fighting over payment defaults and high tariffs for over a year. The dispute has affected India's efforts to attract foreign investment in the power sector and caused Enron and its U.S. partners to announce plans to exit the project. 
Tata Power Company Ltd, India's largest private sector utility firm, and BSES Ltd, another utility company and a member of India's largest conglomerate, the Reliance Group, are already in talks to buy Enron's stake. 
The AV Birla Group has adopted the route of mergers and acquisitions in recent years to consolidate its position in key industries. 
Last week, one of its group companies, Grasim Industries Ltd, bought a 10-percent stake in India's largest cement maker, Larsen & Toubro Ltd 
Earlier this year, Indian Rayon & Industries Ltd, another group company, entered the information technology sector by buying out France's Groupe Bull SA's 50.35 percent stake in PSI Data Systems 
But the group's track record in the power sector has been less than impressive. 
Two joint ventures with Britain's Powergen Plc to produce over 1,000 megawatts of electricity in two Indian states have not made much headway since they were announced in the mid-1990s.

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)
2001-11-26 16:45 (New York)

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)

     (Adds analyst comment in 4th paragraph.)

     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s stock price
declined to a 14-year low and its bonds plunged 10 points on
concern the company won't secure $1 billion in fresh capital,
threatening its plan to be acquired by Dynegy Inc.

     ``The clock is definitely ticking,'' said Jon Kyle
Cartwright, a debt analyst at Raymond James and Associates. ``The
question is the survivability of Enron.''

     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. executives met
today to line up investors for as much as $2 billion of bonds
convertible into stock. The company needs the money to operate
until Dynegy completes its $23 billion purchase. Dynegy unveiled
its plan to make the acquisition on Nov. 9.

     Enron shares and bonds, which opened lower, tumbled after 1
p.m. when no announcement for fresh financing was made. Enron's
6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 plunged to 48 cents on the
dollar, down from 55 cents on Friday. The bonds now yield 26
percent. Enron shares declined 15 percent, or 70 cents, to $4.01.

     Concern that rival Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for
Enron has pushed Enron's stock down 55 percent in the past week.
Enron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after
the company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said
expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales
cost it $1.01 billion.

     ``You haven't heard anything from Dynegy today, and that is a
bit scary,'' said Andy Palmer, who doesn't hold Enron bonds in the
$2 billion he helps manage at ASB Capital Management Inc. in
Washington.

     Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited
partnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted,
and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an
investigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this
month restated its earnings for the past four years.

                        Talks on $1 Billion

     Under the buyout, Enron investors would receive 0.2685 Dynegy
share for each share held. That valued Enron at $10.41 a share, 21
percent more than Enron's share price that day.

     On Friday, the buyout valued Enron at $10.85 a share, more
than double Enron's closing price of $4.71. The widening of the
difference between the value of the offer and Enron's stock price
indicates investors doubt the buyout will go through.

     Shares of Enron traded as low as $3.76 today, rebounding to
close at $4.01. The stock was the most active in U.S. trading
Wednesday and Friday. Dynegy dropped $1.15, or 2.85 percent, to
$39.25. The stock has fallen 30 percent this year. Both companies
are based in Houston.

     Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit
today to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support,
or Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report.

     Moody's Investors Service hasn't issued a report on Enron
since the company filed its 10-Q quarterly report with the SEC a
week ago. The ratings agency's analysts haven't returned calls for
comment.

     Moody's cut Enron's long-term credit rating on Nov. 9, though
it maintained an investment grade.

                          `More Problems'

     ``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head
of investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is
increased concern in the market that there may be more problems
that are yet to be disclosed.''

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck
Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the
note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit
facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger.

     Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first
time in the Enron filing a week ago. Enron also said that it has
less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the
company's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be
cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in
debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

     Enron said in the filing that fourth-quarter profit might be
hurt by a drop in its trading business. Companies such as Aquila
Inc. and Mirant Corp. have reduced their activity with Enron
because of credit concerns.

     ``Should the Dynegy deal fall through, we don't view it
likely that Enron would be able to remain as a stand-alone
company,'' Youngberg of Edward Jones said. ``Without Dynegy, the
credit rating will fall, causing their trading business to dry up
further.''

     Enron, the biggest energy trader, once handled about a
quarter of U.S. gas and power transactions.

     Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two
industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times
reported last week. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.
agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity stake
as part of a transaction to be completed today.



Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating
2001-11-26 15:16 (New York)

Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating

     New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. bonds have
fallen as much as 9 percent this month on investor concern the
energy trader's proposed $23 billion purchase of rival Enron Corp.
will erode its credit rating.

     Dynegy's 6.88 percent coupon notes due in 2011 are trading at
$932 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,024 last month, according
to Merrill Lynch & Co. data. Yield on the debt has risen to 7.9
percent from 6.5 percent as investors demand more return to
compensate for the increased risks of the securities.

     Dynegy's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's Investors
Service, the lowest rung of investment grade, and ``BBB+'' at
Standard & Poor's, two levels higher. Each ratings company said it
may cut Dynegy's credit rating if it buys Enron, which comes with
about $15 billion in debt and a regulatory inquiry into financial
partnerships set up to keep debt off its books.

     ``If you put Dynegy and Enron together it will have a
detrimental effect on Dynegy's credit rating,'' said Tim Nelson,
senior credit analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Cos. in
Minneapolis, which holds Dynegy bonds.

     Dynegy's 7.45 percent coupon notes due in 2006 are trading at
$1,019 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,085 last month,
according to Merrill. The notes yield almost 7 percent, up from
5.4 percent.

     Enron's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's and ``BBB-'' at
S&P, the lowest level of investment grade. Both ratings companies
are reviewing the credit for a possible downgrade and say Dynegy's
buyout plan is what's keeping the grades above junk.

     ``I don't think right now anybody knows exactly what Enron
is,'' said Mark Simenstad, who holds Dynegy bonds in the $5
billion he helps manage at Lutheran Brotherhood.

     ``Dynegy has proven to be pretty well-managed over the years
so you have to give them the benefit of the doubt here,''
Simenstad said. ``The hope is that if there's something they don't
understand they'll walk away.''

     Dynegy has $3.9 billion of bonds outstanding, most of which
come due between 2002 and 2011, according to Bloomberg data.

     Shares of Houston-based Dynegy, which topped $47 two weeks
ago after Chief Executive Chuck Watson said the Enron purchase
would boost earnings by at least 35 percent next year, fell $1.30
to $39.10 in mid-afternoon trading today. Enron's shares, down 92
percent this year, fell as much as 80 cents, or 17 percent, to
$3.91, a the lowest since 1987.



ENRON SHARES SLIDES TO ALL-TIME LOW

By CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:53 PM ET Nov 26, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Enron shares fell as much as 20 percent Monday,
crashing through the $4 level for part to set an all-time low and cast
additional doubt on the energy merchant's plan to be acquired by rival
Dynegy.

Enron (ENE) set a new all-time low of $3.76 Monday afternoon before
closing at $4.01, off 70 cents. More than 60 million shares changed
hands, making it the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.

The stock has lost about half its value since Dynegy announced an
agreement to buy Enron on Nov. 9 and more than 85 percent of its value
in the past month.

Meanwhile, shares of Dynegy (DYN) lost $1.15, or 2.8 percent, to stand
at $39.25.

The collapse in Enron's share price has made it more likely that Dynegy
and Enron will have to renegotiate the terms of their original deal, in
which 0.2685 of a Dynegy share would be exchanged for each outstanding
Enron share.

However, the Financial Times reported that Dynegy remains confident of
its ability to complete a deal for Enron, which has been seeking $500
million in private equity capital to shore up its finances.

""We continue to hear reports the Enron's energy marketing and trading
business, once the crown jewel of the company, has eroded badly with
counterparties only willing to do shorter-term deals,"" A.G. Edwards
&amp; Sons analysts Charles Fishman and Douglas Fischer wrote in a
research note Friday.

Enron investors do not believe that the merger is likely to occur under
the current terms, the analysts said.



Chance of Dynegy backing out

_______________________________________________________________________

On Monday, Michael Heim, also of A.G. Edwards, attributed Enron's
latest stock drop to ""growing belief that the likelihood of the (merger)
deal is not so likely.""

He pointed out that the outlook for Enron is ""not very favorable"" but
in the meantime, it's doing everything it can to stay ""afloat"" while
working on closing the deal.


Last week, Enron said it got a bank extension on a $690 million note to
mid-December. The note was originally set to come due in 2003, but was
bumped up to Nov. 26 due to a rating downgrade at Standard &amp; Poor's.
<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B81418CA4%2D11A5%2D4C7C%2DA602%2DCF3DA4BCAA7B%7D>

The payment by itself is manageable because Enron has about $2 billion
in cash on its hands, Heim said, but ""the event moves Enron's merger one
step closer to the point in which Dynegy is able to exercise the
merger's material adverse condition clauses and back out of, or
restructure, the merger deal.""

Heim has a ""sell"" rating on the stock.

Hi Everyone...

1)  The forecast pattern seems very similar to what we've been talking about over the past several days.  6-10 features below normal in the Midwest and the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet another trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) with the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Midwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to much above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for most of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest.  

3) EarthSat will issue an ""official"" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm today.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc/enron/   and then follow the ""Sunday Update"" link (near the bottom).  Login is ""enron"", Password is ""enron"".

Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the day tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlikely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer picture for the East.*  

 
Enjoy the rest of your weekend...
