Presto has asked me to be the contact to Allan Stewart at PIRA with regard to setting up an arrangement for their consulting services.  I'm currently having information-gathering discussions over services and fees for both gas and power, in both the east and west.  In order to fully incorporate everyone's needs into our arrangement with PIRA, I'll be contacting you this week to gather requests.

Bob,

I talked to Chris about the change of plans.  I am sorry that it did not work out but Dave has more knowledge of the Texas grid and he runs our Waha physical trading activities.  He works well with Mike and he is willing to do whatever we need him to do.  He is spending the rest of the week to suck as much out of Daren as he can.  If there is any training for the logistics systems that he can go to, he should do that as well.  If you have any other recomendations to get him up to speed on the Logistics side I sure would appreciate it.

Tom

"Enron plans to oppose Dynegy in FERC power issue","A heads up for you gas folks that Enron will be on ComEd's side against Dynegy on this power issue at 
FERC, since EES designates Firm LD contracts as sources on ComEd's network transmission system (Dynegy wants ComEd to only allow ""capacity"" contracts to be used).  We plan to file the Enron response on Friday.

Subject:	Dynegy v. ComEd update

Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an ""icap/capacity"" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states ""ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

"NEW WEATHER SWAPS ON THE INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE","  
[IMAGE]
IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce  that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These  fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average  temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week.  Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported  by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement  temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange  website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather  stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International  and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will  be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit  or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. 
The design and development of these new weather  products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized  leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has  worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant  Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and  support for these new products.

"Online Launch Plan Update","With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

"Lunch Budget"," 
Tom, I probably should have explained what my problems are, and why it took me so long to get this to you.  Daniel is the person in charge of the lunches, and he has not had an opportunity to prepare the monthly spreadsheets for August and September, which show the total amounts per day, and how much each cost center is charged.  He's come up with a percentage, according to how many total people he orders for, then according to how many people are in each group, and he charges each cost center accordingly.  I've attached the 2 worksheets that he's provided me, which are for June and July, however there were fewer people in our group because since then he has added Brian Redmond and his group to our budget.  Daniel is working on preparing the spreadsheets for August and September.  I've told Ina that I'm needing them for a project for you, so I'm sure that they will be ready soon.  

I thought that I could just look at what's been charged to our cost center each month, but it was too difficult to figure out which invoices were from which lunch because they don't always hit the cost center the month during or after they were invoiced.  They are also sometimes charged on a credit card and then billed in a huge lump sum.  

I've simply made a spreadsheet showing selected restaurants and the average price of what we've been charged for June and July, and then I've shown what it will cost for 15 people to eat if we order it separately.  I've included tips and delivery charges, since we're billed for those as well.  

Let's talk about it tomorrow.

Sorry, I thought you already had that info.  Phase 1 is the day we turn on EOL (January 21st), Phase 2 is February.  This timing should be consistent with the other gas regions.

"Dave","Tom -

I was going to talk to you today,  but I had several meetings that came up regarding the bankruptcy with the creditors and accounting.  I think we need to plan for Dave going into the commercial organization.  As much as I like Dave's help,  I just don't see how we can work out the controls aspect of this.  Also,  it puts a dynamic into my group that has not been very positive.  Where some people feel like Dave is at an advantage to everyone else.  I think in the end this will be better for all involved.  If you have any further concerns,  please talk to Bob Hall in the morning as I will be out of the office.  Again,  I would like to have talked to you in person,  but by the time I got done with my meetings you were not around.  Thanks for working with me on this.

    HOUSTON, Jan. 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Enron (OTC Bulletin Board: ENRNQ) announced today that Stephen F. Cooper has been named interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.

    Enron's Board of Directors, working in cooperation with its Creditors Committee, made the decision after a review of candidates last week. 
    In addition, the company also named members of the Office of the Chief Executive, which will include Cooper, Jeff McMahon, who has been named president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen, who has been named executive vice president and chief financial officer.

    Following the resignation last week of former Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth L. Lay, the Board intends to promptly focus on the selection of a new chairman. 
    Enron also announced, in accordance with the previously disclosed Master Agreement with UBS Warburg concerning its purchase of Enron's North American wholesale natural gas and power trading business, that Lawrence G.

What Did He Know?; Wife Says Enron CEO Was Out of Loop

The defense of former Enron chief executive Kenneth L. Lay began yesterday when his wife suggested on national television that her husband was kept in the dark as the nation's largest energy-trading company slipped into debilitating debt and collapsed, leaving thousands without jobs and life savings. 
""There's some things that weren't -- that he wasn't told,"" Linda Lay told NBC's ""Today"" show.
Lay, alternately weepy and defiant, provided the first window into what her husband's stance is likely to be if he testifies as scheduled before the Senate Commerce Committee on Monday. He faces congressional and Justice Department investigations and a barrage of civil suits charging that he misled shareholders, employees and the government about the well-being of Enron Corp. 
""Never, never, not for one second would he have allowed anything to go on that was illegal,"" Linda Lay said. ""If those people had come to him and told him that there was something wrong, he would have stopped it and fixed it."" 
She maintained that her husband did not realize until ""two or three days, maybe, before everything fell apart"" that he couldn't save Enron. She also said that she and her husband lost substantial amounts of money in the firm's demise and are fighting personal bankruptcy. 
Linda Lay's comments bluntly put into the public domain what Kenneth Lay's friends, family members and attorneys have been saying in recent weeks: The man who helped build the aggressive, innovative energy company was not involved in the day-to-day details of its operations, trusting his executives, former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling and former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, to make the right choices. Today, Enron is expected to appoint an interim CEO to help restructure the company. 
Some involved in the crisis scoffed at the notion that Lay was that far out of the loop. ""Enron's senior management had full knowledge of the transactions and approved every aspect of them,"" Fastow's spokesman, Gordon Andrew, said yesterday. 
But Lay's defenders maintain that it's plausible that some things slipped by him. ""It's not that he wasn't in charge,"" said one member of Enron's vast legal team said. ""He was in charge, but a lot of things were kept from him and procedures were put in place that didn't work, and he didn't know it until it was too late."" 
According to this source, Lay relied heavily on the judgments of Skilling and Fastow, both of whom were involved in creating the partnerships that shielded hundreds of millions of dollars in losses and overstated profits by nearly $600 million since 1997. ""Ken did not know that Fastow took out $30 million [in compensation] from [one such] partnership,"" the source said. 
Lay himself, asked last year by the New York Times about the complicated partnerships, said, ""You're getting way over my head."" 
Everyone concedes that Lay spent an enormous amount of time on civic projects in recent years. A generous and high-profile activist and philanthropist, he assiduously worked the Houston community as well as the national political scene. He and Enron were among President Bush's largest financial backers. 
""He has this persona as kind of a goodwill ambassador, so people want to believe that he didn't have his hands on the wheel of the ship when it went down. The captain of the Exxon Valdez didn't get off easy,"" said one source familiar with Enron's inner workings. 
Enron disclosed in November that the board had required Lay and other top executives to review and approve every transaction of Fastow's partnerships. But the company's outside counsel, Vinson & Elkins, reported that ""in most instances, there was no approval signature"" by Enron's Office of the Chairman, headed by Lay. Whether the reviews were properly done is now under investigation by a special committee appointed by the board. 
Lay received at least two warning memos from employees fearful that the company would be ruined by its complex and secretive accounting practices. In November, Enron admitted that accounting errors had led it to overstate profits. 
Lay's detractors question why he did not push harder to investigate the employees' concerns. 
Lay's defenders, however, said he relied on Vinson & Elkins, who advised Enron that the concerns of Vice President Sherron Watkins did not, ""in our judgment, warrant a further widespread investigation by independent counsel and auditors."" 
But the law firm also said ""there is serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation"" over the partnerships' activities. The V&E reviewers said they briefed Lay about their findings. 
Lay helped form Enron in 1985, when Houston Natural Gas, which he headed, merged with InterNorth Inc. He took over as CEO in 1986, helping to transform a sleepy pipeline company into one of the globe's largest, most aggressive energy-trading firms. 
He stepped down as CEO about a year ago, passing the reins to Skilling -- a brash former business consultant hired by Enron in 1990. Lay remained chairman of the board, and when Skilling unexpectedly resigned six months later, Lay returned as CEO, at a time -- his family maintains -- that he was trying to retire. 
Linda Lay yesterday also defended her husband's public comments made as late as October assuring employees that everything was okay with the company and encouraging people to buy stock even as the price spiraled downward. ""He totally 100 percent believed in it,"" she said. ""He believed it would be okay."" 
Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2. Lay resigned from the company last week at the urging of Enron's creditors and is spending all his time dealing with lawyers, auditors and accountants preparing for his congressional testimony. One lawyer close to Lay, who requested anonymity, said that Lay was still committed to testifying even though some of his attorneys have advised him that speaking publicly could be risky legally. 
In the NBC interview, taped over the weekend, Linda Lay also painted a bleak picture of her husband's personal finances, saying that the couple were heavily invested in Enron and they are now ""fighting for liquidity."" 
""We don't want to go bankrupt,"" she said. ""Other than the home we live in, everything we own is for sale."" That includes three multimillion-dollar homes in Aspen, Colo., as well as a weekend getaway in Galveston, Tex. 
""By anyone's standards it was a massive amount of money, and it's gone,"" Lay said of her husband's $300 million in compensation and stocks from Enron over the past four years. ""There's nothing left. Everything we had was mostly in Enron stock."" 
In Sugar Land, Tex.,, police still declined to disclose the contents of the note left by former Enron vice chairman J. Clifford Baxter, who was found dead of a gunshot wound in his Mercedes-Benz on Friday. They said that while the autopsy reports had ruled the death a suicide, the investigation would remain open until all the evidence is tested.

Wife: Lay did no wrong but couldn't stop crash 
By BILL MURPHY 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 29, 2002, 12:42AM
The wife of former Enron Chairman Ken Lay said he would have acted to fix the company's problems if he hadn't been kept in the dark by accountants from Arthur Andersen and outside legal counsel. 
""There's some things that weren't -- that he wasn't told,"" Linda Lay said during an interview aired on NBC's Today show Monday. ""There's some things that the board of directors weren't -- didn't know. But that will come out in the investigation."" 
During the interview, Lay described her and her husband's attempt to stave off personal bankruptcy, defended her husband's integrity and said he believes Enron can recover. 
The Lays declined to be interviewed by the Chronicle. A public relations firm representing the family said Linda Lay and her children would do no more interviews for the time being. 
She said she understands why her husband is the focal point of many people's anger. 
""He is at the top. That's where it ought to be,"" Lay said. ""If I were back there listening to all the things that were being said, I would absolutely have to say that: `What is wrong here? How can all of this be happening without something -- someone doing something terribly evil?' "" 
She praised Sherron Watkins, Enron vice president of corporate development, for sending her husband a memo Aug. 15 and later meeting with him to discuss her concerns about the company's practice of hiding losses in off-the-book accounts. 
""He had their, their outside counsel (Vinson & Elkins law firm) come in and the accounting firm look at it,"" Lay said, ""and they came back and told him it was fine."" 
Asked if her husband, who resigned as Enron's chairman last week, felt let down by accountants and lawyers, she replied, ""Absolutely. Absolutely. Never, never, not for one second would he have allowed anything to go on that was illegal. If those people had come back to him and told him there was something wrong, he would have stopped and fixed it."" 
Days after receiving Watkins' memo, Ken Lay exercised options on more than 92,000 shares of Enron stock but did not sell it. That effectively repaid a $2 million loan from the company. 
A month after Watkins warned about looming financial scandal, Lay told employees in an e-mail session that the company was sound and urged them to buy stock. Less than three weeks later, the company reported a third-quarter loss of $618 million and and a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. 
""My husband tells the truth,"" Linda Lay said. ""He's not a liar. He totally, 100 percent believed in it. He believed it would be OK."" 
She said ""everything we own is for sale"" in an effort to stave off personal bankruptcy, even though her husband earned more than $300 million in compensation and salary the past four years. 
""By anyone's standards, it was a massive amount of money,"" Linda Lay said, ""and it's gone. It's gone. There's nothing left. Everything we had mostly was in Enron stock."" 
The Lays did not diversify their investments much, including their 401(k), she said. 
""Why wouldn't I put it in Enron? Why wouldn't I?"" she said. ""My husband was Enron. He believed in it."" 
The Lays own substantial property. In Harris and Galveston counties and Aspen, Colo., they have homes and properties worth at least $27 million. 
Three of their four Aspen properties were up for sale earlier this month: a 4,500-square-foot home listed at $6.8 million; a 4,500-square-foot riverfront home listed at $6.5 million; and a 20,000-square-foot vacant lot listed at $2.9 million. 
Their Houston home, a 12,800-square-foot condominium in the Huntingdon luxury high-rise, has five bedrooms and 6 1/2 baths. It has an assessed market value of $7.1 million. 
They own jointly or separately at least 13 homes and apartment homes in Harris and Galveston counties. Those include a home on Avalon Place assessed at $742,000, a home on Sul Ross Street assessed at $320,000 and a home in Galveston assessed at $790,000. 
""We're fighting for liquidity,"" she said. ""We, we don't want to go bankrupt. And we've had long-term investments, and those long-term investments have cash calls. Other than the home we live in, everything we own is for sale."" 
She began crying when she recounted a conversation with her husband after he realized bankruptcy was inevitable. 
""He was very emotional about it,"" she said. ""He said he just didn't think he could stop it. He said he tried everything, everything he could think of, and he couldn't stop it."" 
She said she and her husband were devastated by the suicide of former Enron Vice Chairman Cliff Baxter on Friday. 
""My husband has spoken to him not too long ago, and Cliff is a, a -- was a wonderful man."" 
Most analysts say Enron -- under investigation by the Justice Department for possible criminal wrongdoing and by 11 congressional committees -- has no chance of avoiding liquidation. But Lay says her husband remains optimistic that the company can emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to become profitable again. 
Consultants who specialize in corporate and political damage control were divided on whether Lay's interview will help her husband's cause. 
Ken Fairchild, principal owner of Fairchild Consulting in Dallas, said the Lays should tell their side of the story since there has been so much negative coverage of Ken Lay's role in Enron's collapse. Ken Lay's lawyers have advised him not to do interviews. 
Ken Lay would have been grilled by an interviewer, but Linda Lay got much easier questions because she is his wife and claims to be a victim as well because her own retirement has evaporated, said Fairchild, author of Sunday Showdowns with 60 Minutes, an account of how he prepared more than 30 corporate executives for appearances on the news show. 
""Obviously, it was a good move,"" said Fairchild. ""It doesn't work unless the person really believes what she is saying. They have to believe they are telling the truth, and they have to look like they are telling the truth. And that certainly sounds like the case here."" 
But Houston political consultant Allen Blakemore said there is little to be gained by calling on your wife to defend your integrity. 
""She's being trotted out to make an appeal to people's emotions,"" Blakemore said. ""Should we go ask his mother if he cleaned up his room or picked up his bath towel? None of this stuff is relevant."" 
Gloria Alvarez, who was laid off from her job as senior administrative assistant for Enron Global Strategic Sourcing, said Linda Lay's interview was predictable. 
""She's the wife of the CEO,"" Alvarez said. ""Of course she's going to defend her husband, as any wife would."" 
Nathan Childs, who was laid off from Enron's information technology hardware department, is living in a trailer on his parents' property in Kempner. 
""I can't cry for the Lays right now. They have a home to go to every night,"" Childs said. ""It doesn't matter what she says; Ken Lay's got more than ex-Enron employees.""

Enron Workers File Suit Over 'Staggering Losses'

Enron Corp. employees past and present who said they suffered ""staggering losses"" in their retirement funds filed a lawsuit Monday seeking reimbursement from top company executives. 
The legal action came as the wife of ousted Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay was claiming in a television appearance that the couple are nearly broke.
The group of more than 400 Enron employees, whose 401(k) retirement plans are now virtually worthless, contends in the federal lawsuit filed in Houston that employees were urged to invest in Enron stock but were not told how fragile the company's financial condition was. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2. 
The suit names as defendants Lay, former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, among others. Those three executives sold more than $198 million in stock, the suit alleges. The suit also names Northern Trust Co., trustee for the retirement plan, and Andersen, Enron's former accountant. 
""Enron executives were profiting from an elaborate shell game, using the hard-earned retirement savings of their loyal employees,"" Randy McClanahan, a lawyer representing the group, said in a statement. 
This is the latest in dozens of lawsuits filed against current and former Enron executives, accusing them of misleading investors. The company and its officers have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. 
So did Linda Lay, who defended her husband, in a taped interview aired Monday on NBC's ""Today"" show, as an ""honest, decent, moral human being who would do absolutely nothing wrong."" 
Lay, appearing bitter and emotional, told NBC News correspondent Lisa Myers that everything the family owns is for sale except the opulent Houston home where the interview took place over the weekend. Ken Lay, Myers noted, has been advised by his lawyers to avoid speaking to the media. 
Lay acknowledged that her husband earned ""a massive amount of money."" However, she added: ""It's all gone. There's nothing left. Everything we had mostly was in Enron stock."" 
The couple's wealth has been further drained by cash calls on other long-term investments, and the Lays are nearly bankrupt, she said. Lay said that she understands the anger being focused on her husband but that he did not know all that occurred at Enron before the company crumbled into insolvency. 
Public relations professionals, who asked not to be identified, saw the interview as a desperate move to humanize Ken Lay--but one that may not play well. 
""I don't know what ... they were thinking,"" one said.

Enron's System Has New Owners, But Will It Fly?
By Mitchell Pacelle and Peter A. McKay
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

As UBS AG prepares to take over Enron Corp.'s once-powerful energy trading operation, the Swiss bank faces a question: When the trading system flicks back on, will Enron's former customers come with it? 
Since Enron's meltdown late last year, competitors have been whittling at the flagship oil, natural-gas and electricity trading business that UBS is taking over. While some customers will go over to the new entity, which has been dormant for two months, others say they may stay away.
""I can't imagine us dealing with them,"" said George Hickox, chief executive of Wiser Oil Co., a former customer and current Enron creditor that has since taken its trading business to Morgan Stanley. Mr. Hickox said he'd be inclined not to go back unless the Enron bankruptcy plan ""is good enough to make us feel that we're not doing business with someone who shafted us."" 
While companies like Reliant Energy Inc., El Paso Corp. and Duke Energy Corp. have stepped up their energy-trading operations since the Enron collapse -- as have the energy trading desks at Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. -- other Enron trading operations may have simply evaporated. Trading in fiber-optic bandwidth and weather derivatives, for instance, weren't bought by UBS and aren't being picked up by others, raising questions about how vibrant the businesses were in the first place. 
The fortunes of Enron's former energy-trading business are being closely watched on Wall Street. Historically, it has been difficult for trading companiess to stop operating, as Enron has done since filing for bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, and then ratchet up the business again. 
In addition, revitalizing the Enron trading operation is critical to maximizing the recovery by Enron's creditors, who are owed billions. At its peak, Enron enjoyed a 15% market share in natual-gas trading, and 20% in power, competitors estimate. 
In an interview, UBS Warburg Chief Executive Officer John Costas expressed confidence that with a new name -- UBS Warburg Energy -- and UBS's credit rating behind the operation, customers will return. ""You have to win clients one by one,"" said Mr. Costas. ""If we're able to replicate everything they had in terms of capabilities on a AA+ credit-rated platform, there's a pretty high probability of success."" 
The trading unit, which includes its EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform, generated roughly 90% of Enron's earnings in the most recent quarter, although accounting questions have clouded Enron's financial results. Mr. Costas declined to comment on how Enron accounted for the unit's trading revenues. 
Some traders expect UBS to take a much more cautious approach than Enron as it rebuilds the trading operation. Moreoever, many of the companies that were stuck in trading contracts with Enron itself may be gun-shy about doing business with its successor, having struggled to unwind their Enron trades. ""At the end of the day, nobody is going to undo the efforts they just went through to come back to Enron,"" said Charlie Sanchez, energy-markets manager for Gelber & Associates, an energy consulting firm in Houston. 
In bidding on the unit, UBS beat out Citigroup Inc. in a bankruptcy-court auction that concluded Jan. 11. Under the deal, UBS isn't offering any cash to Enron for its trading operations and isn't taking over its trading portfolio. Instead, it agreed to pay royalties to Enron amounting to one-third of the energy-trading operation's pretax profit for a 10-year period. UBS has an option to eliminate the royalty payments by buying out Enron's stake in the profits. The agreement doesn't require UBS to inject any minimum amount of capital, nor supply any minimum amount of credit. 
While the terms of the deal seem to limit UBS's risk in taking over a spectacularly tainted business, some trading experts say the deal poses other perils. 
""UBS is taking a fair degree of risk in buying this operation,"" maintained Henry T. C. Hu, professor of banking law and finance law at the University of Texas School of Law. ""They've invested, in a sense, their reputation. If it turns out they misjudged the plusses of the Enron deal, it may undermine their image in the eyes of customers and potential customers."" 
UBS hasn't yet spelled out how it will restart the Enron unit, which will be run by Michael Hutchins, UBS Warburg's co-head of bond operations. UBS said it intends to use its assets to back the trades of the new operation. ""We're going to provide the necessary capital and credit support to ensure the success of the business,"" said Mr. Costas. 
Since winning the auction, UBS has been working to hire Enron trading employees it deems key to the new operation. UBS said yesterday it had signed on about 625 of the Enron trading group's 800 employees. 
Enron's competitors are also in the hunt for talent. ""The number of resumes flying around this industry from Enron traders is amazing,"" says Harvey Padewer, president of the energy-services unit of Duke Energy, an Enron competitor. Mr. Padewer said his company has received more than 500 resumes, and hired about two dozen, including a dozen traders. 
As Enron's woes unfolded, industry analysts say the trading activity quickly shifted from its online platform to several competitors. In a few cases, smaller companies that couldn't find companies like Enron to guarantee their trades simply got out of the market. 
The online IntercontinentalExchange seems to be the biggest winner, with its overall volume up about 65% since the Enron collapse began. On the New York Mercantile Exchange's trading floor, energy trading volume is up 71% this month, while Duke Energy reported a 77% year-over-year increase in electricity trading in the fourth quarter, due in part to Enron's collapse. 
Despite such an abundance of busy trading outlets, Mr. Costas contends that the widening of spreads on energy trades since the collapse of Enron indicates that there isn't enough liquidity in the marketplace. ""The markets are telling us if we restore liquidity, we're going to be able to capture market share,"" he said. 
Nymex President J. Robert Collins cautioned against attributing his exchange's recent volume gains entirely to Enron, considering that natural-gas trading tends to be busiest during the winter heating season anyway. 
""It's hard to characterize whether we've seen a lot of business or a little,"" because of Enron, said Mr. Collins. ""It's definitely helped, but just how much is very difficult to know.""

Doubts Increasing About Enron's Ability To Reorganize
By Kathy Chu

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- What little confidence remains in Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) ability to reorganize itself is rapidly waning.
Amid allegations of document shredding and other misdeeds by Enron executives, creditors are becoming more aggressive in their criticism of the company, and more vocal in their demands for information. 
In the past week, a movement to appoint an independent trustee to take control of the company or an examiner to investigate wrongdoing has been brewing. Also, creditors are petitioning the court to segregate the cash flowing into one of Enron's units, saying that the parent company can't be trusted to keep accurate records and to divvy up funds appropriately among its subsidiaries. 
They also want detailed accounting of cash flows for some of the bankrupt subsidiaries - information that Enron isn't required to submit to federal Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, for another five months. 
The continuing source of Enron's troubles: a colossal collapse of confidence that first brought the company to its knees late last year, and now is threatening to endanger its reorganization efforts. 
Andrew Entwistle, of the Entwistle & Cappucci law firm, which represents a Florida state pension fund that lost $334 million in Enron-related investments, said he has ""very grave concerns"" about the company's ability to oversee its own operations in light of recent disclosures. 
The Florida State Board of Administration hasn't joined the movement to get a trustee named, according to Entwistle, but ""may yet find that it's necessary."" 
Lately, even Enron has been less optimistic about prospects for getting back on its feet quickly. 
When asked a little more than a week ago about whether Enron will emerge from bankruptcy within a year - as the company had previously said it would - Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said that reorganization will be completed ""as soon as possible."" He declined to give a specific timeframe. 
Examiner More Likely Than Trustee 

The naming of a trustee to wrench Enron North America out of the hands of the parent company isn't likely because of the disruption this would have on already complex bankruptcy proceedings, according to legal experts. 
But the odds are increasing for having an examiner assigned to the case to investigate wrongdoing, according to experts, as allegations of corporate misconduct by Enron executives pile up. 
Under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code, ""fraud, dishonesty, incompetence or gross mismanagement"" are grounds that could warrant the appointment of an independent trustee or examiner. 
Pending investigations by the Department of Justice and at least 10 congressional committees could yield information useful to Enron's bankruptcy proceedings, but these probes could take months, if not years, to be completed, according to Jack Williams, the outgoing scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute, a nonprofit think tank in Alexandria, Va. 
This may provide justification for Judge Gonzalez to name an examiner, in order to investigate specific aspects of Enron's complex business operations on a court-dictated timeline. 
Also, if the judge feels that ongoing investigations aren't ""full or fair,"" he may revert to this legal option, said Williams. 
A half-dozen energy concerns and the Regents of the University of California are spearheading the effort to name either a trustee or examiner in the case, the largest bankruptcy in history. 
Some of these same creditors also are taking issue with Enron's cash management system, and are petitioning the bankruptcy court to segregate Enron North America's funds for that unit's creditors. 
This will prevent ""future plundering"" of the estate by other bankrupt entities, according to Wiser Oil Co. (WZR), an Enron creditor owed about $7 million on energy trades. 
The Enron North America unit includes the core wholesale trading operations, which comprised about 90% of the company's $101 billion in revenue last year. This business was recently sold to UBS Warburg for future profit payouts, with no cash up front. 
Under the current cash management system, funds are swept up to the parent company, which is charged with keeping track of which unit is owed money. This system is commonly used to centralize a company's finances and keep the accounting simple, according to legal experts. 
Requiring Enron to implement a separate system for Enron North America will entail ""a significant expenditure of time and effort on the part of the Debtors' employees and retained professionals,"" the company said in a court filing on Sunday. 
It also would be a wasted step if Enron ever decides to enact a substantive consolidation, which would sweep all of the company's assets into one pot and allocate them to a greater pool of creditors. 
""It's too early to think about"" this possibility, Enron attorney Brian Rosen, of Weil Gotshal & Manges, said earlier this month. 
The company believes that the cash management system is sufficient to protect creditors because a subsidiary's cash flow will ""continue to be subject to the guidelines of budgets and business plans for each individual Debtor."" 
Also, because most of the company's units have been pledged as collateral under a debtor-in-possession facility led by J.P. Morgan Chase Inc. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C), any money borrowed will be ""repaid by entities whose creditors benefit"" from the loan, according to Enron. 
The final size of Enron's financing has yet to be decided, but banking sources familiar with the deal have said it could be less than $500 million. This compares with $1.5 billion originally expected under the facility, which Enron has yet to draw upon.

Dynegy Inc., once a prospective savior for Enron Corp., expects to officially acquire one of the fallen energy giant's most prized assets by the end of the week, a spokesman said. 
Enron agreed Jan. 3 to surrender the 16,500-mile Northern Natural Gas Pipeline in exchange for $1.5 billion that Dynegy invested in Enron before a proposed merger of the two Houston-based competitors fell apart in late November. Enron filed the largest bankruptcy in history Dec. 2.
As agreed in November, Dynegy will pay a $23 million excise fee for invoking its option to acquire the pipeline. Dynegy also will assume roughly $750 million in debt and liabilities. 
Enron maintains its option to buy the pipeline back by June 30.

DESTRUCTION OF ENRON AUDIT DOCUMENTS
EDWARD J. MARKEY

02/24/2002
Congressional Testimony by Federal Document Clearing House
(Copyright 2002 by Federal Document Clearing House, Inc.)

JANUARY 24, 2002 
OPENING STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDWARD J. MARKEY (D-MA)
OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE 
HEARING ON DESTRUCTION OF ENRON-RELATED DOCUMENTS OF ARTHUR ANDERSON PERSONNEL THURSDAY, 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for extending to me the courtesy of participating in today's hearing. 
I think it is outrageous that the same executives who may be responsible for the destruction of workers' pensions -- and the destruction of documents that might prove their guilt -- are currently protected by Congress when defrauded worker's actually try to recover their life savings. But, sadly, it is true. Why? Because in 1995, Arthur Anderson and the other big accounting firms succeeded in lobbying Congress to strictly limit their future liability for securities fraud. That bill passed over the President's veto as part of the Republican Contract with America. And today, we are seeing the grim results -- Arthur Anderson can no longer be held jointly and severally liable when a court has found them guilty of securities fraud. I believe that this ill-advised law has directly contributed to a rising tide of accounting failures, culminating in the Enron-Arthur Anderson fiasco. The types of internal checks and balances that a healthy concern about litigation risk used to create within each accounting firm has been undermined. The many honest and decent people who want to do the right thing get overruled, and the increasing revenues coming from consulting and non-audit businesses put growing pressure to sign off on the `cooked books' of major clients. 
Yesterday, I introduced legislation aimed helping to address this problem. This bill would, among other things, require auditors to retain copies of all documents generated during the course of an audit for a period of four years and establish criminal penalties of up to ten years imprisonment for auditors that knowingly and willfully destroy such documents. The bill also would reform the liability standards applicable to accountants in securities fraud cases and provide an exemption from the ""Catch 22"" discovery stay that allows accounting firms to escape accountability for their actions. I look forward to working with Members on this and other reforms. Clearly, we have a system that is very broken, and we need to work together to fix it. 
Today's hearing is focused on the disturbing reports that employees of Arthur Anderson have destroyed documents in connection with the Enron debacle. I think it's appalling that Anderson CEO Joseph Berardino has declined the Subcommittee's invitation to testify on this matter, when he was somehow able to make an appearance on Meet the Press last Sunday. I have also read that Mr. Berardino has agreed to appear before the House Financial Services Committee on February 4th. If Mr. Berardino can appear to answer questions on national television and before other Committees, it seems to me that he should be able to appear before this Subcommittee so that we can get to the bottom of why his firm destroyed documents being sought by the SEC, by the Justice Department, and by defrauded workers and investors. 
Now, I have many questions about the underlying transactions and investments whose accounting treatment helped to bring Enron to bankruptcy, but I understand that this is not the subject of today's hearing. I would merely hope, Mr. Chairman, that we will have a chance to thoroughly examine Enron's investments in broadband, its energy trading operations, and its derivatives and other structured financings in the detail needed to understand just what happened here and what lessons we can learn from this massive fraud and misbehavior. That will require more than a single hearing of all of the principals to do properly. 
Thanks again, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to participate in today's hearing. I look forward to the testimony.

Texas Atty Genl To Rule On Release Of Baxter Suicide Note

01/29/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The city of Sugar Land, Texas, has requested that the Texas Attorney General decide whether the contents of a suicide note found in the car of former Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) executive J. Clifford Baxter will be released to the public. 
Baxter, 43 years old, was found dead early Friday morning in his parked Mercedes Benz by police on a routine patrol in the affluent Houston suburb.
Although a coroner has ruled Baxter's death a suicide, the Sugar Land Police Department is continuing a full investigation in accordance with procedure. The investigation includes ballistic tests, fingerprinting and hair and fiber analysis, police said. 
The police department had not yet received the medical examiner's official report as of Tuesday morning. 
The suicide note found in the vehicle has been under seal while the investigation proceeds. 
The police department has completed its review of the note and doesn't object to the release of its contents, said Sugar Land city attorney Joe Morris. ""However, under Texas law, the contents of the note raise confidentially issues, including right-to-privacy questions that prohibit the city from releasing the note without first receiving a determination from the Texas Attorney General."" 
According to Morris, the city must submit a request for an Attorney General ruling within 10 business days from the first request for the note. The first request was received Jan. 25. 
The Attorney General has 45 business days to make a determination, unless extended. 
Baxter, who resigned as vice chairman of Enron last May, was reported to have complained about Enron's questionable accounting practices. Baxter was subpoenaed to appear in front of two congressional committees and was named in an insider trading lawsuit. 
Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in early December, the largest in the U.S. to date.

Features/Enron
Monster Mess ; The Enron fallout has just begun. Things can't stay the same, can they?

Anytime a stock market bubble bursts, a business scandal that epitomizes the excesses of that particular period is seldom far behind. The Roaring '20s had Teapot Dome. The end of the bull market in the early 1970s was marked by the collapse of Equity Funding Corp. The 1980s, of course, had Michael Milken. 
Until recently it wasn't easy to choose the scandal that encapsulated the 1990s bubble. That's not because there was a shortage of sleazy behavior but rather because there was an abundance of it. Rampant conflicts of interest on Wall Street. Wildly creative accounting. Auditors who didn't audit. Money managers who didn't manage. A stunning lack of oversight by regulators. We could go on.
But now the wait is over: Enron's bankruptcy is, without doubt, the grand finale of the last decade of the 20th century. The company's rise and fall was made possible by a willingness to overlook--and indeed, for a time, even to reward--all of the above behavior. 
Then there's the politics. The hint of impropriety at the highest levels of government has cemented the energy giant's place in history, producing a barrage of coverage that has even supplanted the war in Afghanistan as the lead story in newspapers. That alone, in today's weird circular logic, would be enough to make a nonresponse by the political system nearly impossible. 
But politics are almost beside the point. As a financial scandal, Enron is much bigger than anyone imagined--and, more important, the factors that enabled it haven't gone away. ""Systemic conflicts of interest are more pervasive and corrosive than either Congress, regulators, investors, or the press appreciate,"" Scott Cleland, CEO of the Precursor Group, an independent research firm, said in congressional testimony. ""The breathtakingly swift collapse of Enron is no isolated incident that can be dismissed as unique, brushed under the rug, and ignored."" The real question should be not whether the Enron debacle will change anything, but how much and how soon? 
The most scintillating Enron tidbits are emerging from a nondescript set of rooms on Capitol Hill, filled with some 40 boxes of documents from the company and its auditor, Arthur Andersen. Over the past few weeks as many as ten people, four of them working full- time, have been combing through the boxes. On the wall of a room is a map laying out details of Enron's controversial myriad partnerships. The investigation is being conducted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Louisiana's Billy Tauzin, whose work makes it seem unlikely that the financial story will be buried by either its sheer complexity or the unfolding political sideshow. 
What has the committee discovered? For one thing, founder and chairman Ken Lay, who often came across as clueless as Enron unraveled, deserves a great deal of blame. If nothing else, Lay allowed a culture of rule breaking to flourish, and he obviously misled investors. Enron's adventures in creative accounting are not a recent development. Back in mid-1995, Jim Alexander, then CFO of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, walked into Lay's office to report concerns he had about Enron's numbers for overseas projects. ""I told him I had heard there were manifold serious problems with the [accounting on] international projects,"" Alexander recalls. Lay's reaction? Nothing. 
That wasn't the only warning. One of the most remarkable documents unearthed by Energy and Commerce researchers was an unsigned seven- page letter from Enron vice president Sherron Watkins to Lay, written on Aug. 15, 2001. The letter informed him, among other things, that Enron executives ""consistently and constantly"" questioned the company's accounting methods to senior officials, including former CEO Jeff Skilling. ""I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals,"" she wrote. That was around the same time Lay was telling Wall Street that there weren't any ""accounting issues, trading issues, or reserve issues"" at Enron. Two months later, when Enron announced its quarterly financial results, Lay had this to say: ""The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enron's leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook."" 
In reality, of course, Enron was a bigger financial scandal than even the most critical observers believed. Watkins' letter makes it clear that the partnerships and off-balance-sheet entities that Enron created weren't used just to ""reduce risk,"" as the company claimed repeatedly last fall. They were used to cook the books, plain and simple. ""That's just too bad, too fraudulent, surely AA&Co. wouldn't let them get away with that,"" wrote Watkins, anticipating the reaction should outsiders begin to dig into the accounting. 
If Arthur Andersen hadn't ""let them get away with it,"" what would Enron's earnings have looked like? How much of the $101 billion in revenues that Enron reported in 2000 were created via multiple transactions with entities that weren't independent third parties? And the partnerships are only part of the story. The other issue is Enron's overly aggressive use of mark-to-market accounting. There's nothing wrong with this method of accounting, which entails pricing securities at their fair value and running gains or losses through the income statement. But in illiquid markets, like those for long- term energy contracts, there's no benchmark of fair value. So Enron often relied on internal models--which creates serious potential for abuse. And because Skilling and Lay had established a culture in which earnings growth was paramount, managers had plenty of incentive to push the limits. 
Enron's much-hyped North American trading operation, which at one point accounted for the majority of its reported earnings and $70 billion valuation, is now nearly worthless. After the company declared bankruptcy, it set out to find a well-capitalized third party and create a joint venture to restart the trading operation. Only two firms--UBS Warburg and Citigroup--were interested (although BP Amoco did offer $25 million for some pieces of Enron's technology). UBS Warburg, the winning bidder, will pay Enron a third of any pretax profits for ten years and has the option to buy the business outright for a multiple of the previous years' profits--but UBS is not assuming any of the business' liabilities. In other words, UBS basically got a free option on the business. 
All this makes Enron a political issue, but not for the obvious reasons. Much has been made of the multiple phone calls that Enron executives placed during the company's dying days to Administration officials--including Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Commerce Secretary Don Evans, and Treasury's Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Peter Fisher. But despite the money that Enron lavished on all sorts of people, no one came to its rescue. And whatever influence Enron had on energy policy (according to one former employee, Vice President Dick Cheney had only one sit- down meeting with Lay in early 2001, and he opposed Enron on such key issues as the Kyoto Accord and nuclear power), the company isn't around to enjoy the benefits. 
The bigger political issue is not Enron's input on energy matters but rather its earlier influence on financial policies. Most notably, Enron lobbied for legislation, passed in 2000, that exempted much of its energy-trading business from oversight. That legislation passed through the Senate Banking Committee, which was chaired by Phil Gramm, a big recipient of Enron funds; his wife, Wendy, sat on Enron's board. Enron also lobbied for mark-to-market accounting; in 1998 the Emerging Issues Task Force, which is backed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, said that energy-trading contracts should be booked on that basis--but the agency included few guidelines for valuing illiquid contracts. 
Clearly, the fallout from Enron has only just begun. One obvious candidate for change is the accounting business. Enron is just the latest in a long string of disasters for the industry--remember Waste Management, Sunbeam, and Cendant?--but it's by far the biggest. And Arthur Andersen is facing not just a slap on the wrist but a battle for survival. That won't be easy, given that Andersen is the only one with deep pockets left standing--and Enron's legal strategy will be to say that complicated transactions were left to the judgment of its accounting firm. Mark L. Cheffers, a former accounting litigation consultant who is now CEO of Accountingmalpractice.com, estimates that Andersen may be exposed to $10 billion to $20 billion in liabilities. The previous largest settlement of an accounting case was the $335 million Ernst & Young paid to settle claims related to Cendant. Putting legal liabilities aside, Andersen may not have much of a business left. ""The tremendous damage done to their credibility will make it extremely difficult to attract business to their firm,"" says Lynn Turner, the SEC's former chief accountant. One portfolio manager says that if a company is audited by Andersen, he simply won't invest in it. 
All that may finally be enough to give accountants backbone. The fact that even lay people now realize that the profession is a mess may give regulators the clout they didn't have when Arthur Levitt, the former head of the SEC, tried to enact reforms a few years ago. At that time the cognoscenti were well aware of the conflicts that accounting firms faced--but no one cared enough to make the situation change. SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt has now called for an organization that would discipline accountants for ethical violations. 
But while Arthur Andersen has much to answer for, current accounting rules allowed Enron a great deal of latitude. In the view of some, there are actually too many rules, because rules inevitably leave loopholes that can be exploited and create a mindset where form is more important than substance. Contrast that with Britain, where accountants have a ""true and fair"" override, which they use if the accounting treatment follows the letter of the law but doesn't fully reflect the economics of a transaction. 
Another good candidate for reform is retirement plans. The talk is that Congress will finally put limits on what percent of a plan's total assets can be in company stock--perhaps 20%--and make it easier for ordinary employees to sell their shares. Oddly enough, there's less discussion about options, although the fact that Enron executives were able to sell $1 billion in stock over the past decade is precisely because they were given such generous option grants. If accounting laws had mandated that the cost of those options be reflected in reported earnings, would Enron--which cared deeply about reported earnings--have enriched its executives to such an extent? 
But the area most in need of reform is the one that is least likely to change. That's Wall Street. Although Enron's inadequate financial disclosure made it impossible to ascertain the company's true condition, those who bothered to read its documents saw enough-- including curious mentions of the partnerships as early as 2000--to be suspicious. Despite the professions of shock about Enron's liberal use of off-balance-sheet entities, when CFO magazine bestowed the ""Excellence Award for Capital Structure Management"" on former CFO Andy Fastow in 1999, analysts and rating agencies raved about his creative use of such ""unique"" financing techniques. And the fact that executives were selling stock at a frightening pace was publicly available information. Skeptics eventually made fortunes shorting the stock. Why didn't anyone else care? Perhaps because when everyone-- money managers, analysts, banks, management--benefits from a soaring stock, no one has any incentive to ask disturbing questions. ""A lot of knowledgeable people on Wall Street were duped, didn't care, or purposefully went along for the ride at the expense of thousands of others,"" said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat. 
You only have to look at Citigroup to see the multiple roles that Wall Street firms can play today. Analyst Ray Niles of Salomon Smith Barney (which is owned by Citigroup) was one of Enron's biggest bulls. Citigroup (along with J.P. Morgan) led most of Enron's financings in the '90s, and was owed around $1 billion by Enron. Why did the banks, which have access to information that equity investors don't, keep handing Enron money? And Citigroup is an investor in LJM2, one of the Enron partnerships that was run by Andy Fastow. Of all the phone calls that were placed during Enron's final days, the one that seems most inappropriate was made by Robert Rubin, former Treasury Secretary and current Citigroup chairman of the executive committee, to Under Secretary Fisher, raising the possibility that he intervene with the rating agencies on behalf of Enron. 
So far all the major players in this drama are doing whatever they can to dodge responsibility. ""Lay, Skilling, Fastow et al. have demonstrated a remarkable ability to ignore their personal responsibility for this,"" says University of Houston management professor J. Timothy McMahon. If it weren't so tragic, it would be comical: In Skilling's one public appearance since he abruptly resigned from the company last August for undisclosed ""personal reasons,"" he said, ""I had no idea the company was in anything but excellent shape."" Watkins' letter suggests otherwise: Skilling ""knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon ship now than resign in shame in two years,"" she wrote. All the stories can't conflict forever, and at some point, we'll know the answer to the biggest question of all: Who's going to jail?

First; Value Driven
You're On Your Own That Enron workers lost life savings is just another sign that the short era of economic security is over.
Geoffrey Colvin

The miserable fate of Enron's employees will be a landmark in business history, one of those awful events that everyone agrees must never be allowed to happen again. This urge is understandable and noble: Thousands have lost virtually all their retirement savings with the demise of Enron stock. But making sure it never happens again may not be possible, because the sudden impoverishment of those Enron workers represents something even larger than it seems. It's the latest turn in the unwinding of one of the most audacious promises of the 20th century. 
The promise was assured economic security--even comfort--for essentially everyone in the developed world. With the explosion of wealth that began in the 19th century it became possible to think about a possibility no one had dared to dream before. The fear at the center of daily living since caveman days--lack of food, warmth, shelter--would at last lose its power to terrify. That remarkable promise became reality in many ways. Governments created welfare systems for anyone in need and separate programs for the elderly (Social Security in the U.S.). Labor unions promised not only better pay for workers but also pensions for retirees. Giant corporations came into being and offered the possibility--in some cases the promise--of lifetime employment plus guaranteed pensions. The cumulative effect was a fundamental change in how millions of people approached life itself, a reversal of attitude that must rank as one of the largest in human history. For millennia the average person's stance toward providing for himself had been, Ultimately I'm on my own. Now it became, Ultimately I'll be taken care of.
The early hints that this promise might be broken on a large scale came in the '80s. U.S. business had become uncompetitive globally and began restructuring massively, with huge layoffs. The trend accelerated in the '90s as the bastions of corporate welfare faced reality. IBM ended its no-layoff policy. AT&T fired thousands, many of whom found such a thing simply incomprehensible, and a few of whom killed themselves. The other supposed guarantors of our economic security were also in decline. Labor-union membership and power fell to their lowest levels in decades. President Clinton signed a historic bill scaling back welfare. Americans realized that Social Security won't provide social security for any of us. 
A less visible but equally significant trend affected pensions. To make costs easier to control, companies moved away from defined- benefit pension plans, which obligate them to pay out specified amounts years in the future, to defined-contribution plans, which specify only how much goes into the plan today. The most common type of defined-contribution plan is the 401(k). The significance of the 401(k) is that it puts most of the responsibility for a person's economic fate back on the employee. Within limits the employee must decide how much goes into the plan each year and how it gets invested- -the two factors that will determine how much it's worth when the employee retires. 
Which brings us back to Enron. Those billions of dollars in vaporized retirement savings were in employees' 401(k) accounts. That is, the employees chose how much money to put into those accounts and then chose how to invest it. Enron matched a certain proportion of each employee's 401(k) contribution with company stock, so everyone was going to end up with some Enron in his or her portfolio; but that could be regarded as a freebie, since nothing compels a company to match employee contributions at all. 
At least two special features complicate the Enron case. First, some shareholders charge top management with illegally covering up the company's problems, prompting investors to hang on when they should have sold. Second, Enron's 401(k) accounts were locked while the company changed plan administrators in October, when the stock was tanking, so employees could not have bailed out if they wanted to. 
But by far the largest cause of this human tragedy is that thousands of employees were heavily overweighted in Enron stock. Many had placed 100% of their 401(k) assets in the stock rather than in the 18 other investment options they were offered. Of course that wasn't prudent, but it's what some of them did. 
The Enron employees' retirement disaster is part of the larger trend away from guaranteed economic security. That's why preventing such a thing from ever happening again may be impossible. The huge attitudinal shift to I'll-be-taken-care-of took at least a generation. The shift back may take just as long. It won't be complete until a new generation of employees see assured economic comfort as a 20th-century quirk, and understand not just intellectually but in their bones that, like most people in most times and places, they're on their own.

WASHINGTON -- After thousands of Enron Corp. workers lost their nest eggs in the energy company's collapse, employees at other companies are looking to diversify their retirement savings -- sometimes with the help of their employers. 
Enron employees were hit hard because their 401(k) plans were stacked with Enron stock, to the tune of 60% of total assets at the end of 2000. But if Enron's combustion was spectacular, its pension situation was hardly unusual. Many other major companies, including General Electric Co., Texas Instruments Inc. and William Wrigley Jr. Co., also have most of their 401(k) assets in company stock, say 401(k) industry analysts.
In many cases, the companies match employee contributions with their own stock and impose restrictions on selling the stock. Workers themselves often choose to bet heavily on their companies. Even former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay is now facing bankruptcy after failing to diversify his portfolio, according to his wife, Linda, who was speaking on NBC's ""Today"" show. 
Now the situation is starting to change. 
Leslie Sewell, a former television producer for NBC, a GE affiliate, voluntarily put all of her 401(k) holdings in GE and rode the stock as its value more than quadrupled since the mid-1980s. GE stock continues to perform well, but she isn't taking any chances. ""The Enron thing is like the vampire in the bedroom,"" says Ms. Sewell, who is in her 50s. ""If you survive it and wake up the next morning, you should do something about it."" She says she will probably leave only 10% to 20% of her 401(k) assets in GE, and put the rest into stock or bond funds. 
Diebold Inc., a Canton, Ohio, maker of automated teller machines, last week announced that it will ease restrictions that require employees to hold company-matched Diebold stock in their defined contribution plan until they turn 55, and instead require them to hold such stock for one year. 
Diebold has invited the Vanguard Group, a 401(k) provider, to speak to employees about the need to diversify, especially targeting those with heavy concentrations in any one instrument. 
These moves are part of a continuing plan to increase employees' investment options, says Chuck Sheurer, Diebold's vice president for human resources, but ""I can't say we weren't influenced by Enron."" 
To be sure, for many companies the benefits of matching in company stock, which is cheaper than contributing cash and keeps the stock in friendly hands, are attractive and numerous companies are unlikely to pay more than lip service to change. 
But political pressure from the Enron bankruptcy-proceedings could force change upon them, so some companies are contemplating loosening restrictions to fend off potential legislation, says John Doyle, vice president of marketing and communications for T. Rowe Price's retirement-plan service. 
Congress has scheduled numerous hearings on pension reform, and a number of lawmakers have proposed bills that would cap the amount of employer-company stock in 401(k) plans. 
Mr. Doyle says T. Rowe Price is helping clients that are talking about loosening their rules to understand the pros and cons of such a move. In addition, ""a lot of pressure will come from employees,"" he says, adding that his company's phone banks have fielded a number of calls from plan participants who are asking, ""Can this happen to me?"" 
That is certainly a question being asked by some workers at Sam's Club, a chain of warehouse stores owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Wal-Mart allows employees to participate in both a profit-sharing program, which is heavily weighted in company stock, and a 401(k) plan, where Wal-Mart makes cash contributions to employees who then may choose how to invest the money from a number of options, including Wal-Mart stock. 
Alan Peto, a 28-year-old Sam's Club cashier in Las Vegas, says he had been planning to increase his allocation of Wal-Mart stock to as much as half of his 401(k) assets from the current 5% -- until Enron collapsed. ""There's a lot of tongue-in-cheek comments, `If this happens to Enron, what about us?' "" he says. 
Other worried Wal-Mart employees are turning to unions for advice. Greg Denier, assistant to the president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, says its Web site aimed at wooing Wal-Mart workers has averaged 250 hits a day in the wake of the Enron debacle, with many questions focused on the security of workers' retirement savings. 
Wal-Mart spokesman Tom Williams says, ""Wal-Mart is known as a very solid company that thinks of its employees first."" He adds that it provides 14 different investment choices, including company stock, for its 401(k) plan. 
At Textron Inc., one-fifth of the company's 35,000 employees have changed their 401(k) asset allocation in the past few weeks -- most choosing to reduce the ratio of their company holdings -- after the Providence, R.I., company eased investment restrictions late last year, says company spokeswoman Susan Bishop. 
Some companies that already have flexible investment policies are pushing harder the importance of diversification. Texas Instruments' stock accounts for about three-quarters of the $3 billion in assets in the Dallas company's 401(k) plan, even though it matches employee contributions in cash and gives employees flexibility to shift holdings among a dozen investment options, including company stock. While the company doesn't plan to change its approach, it is intensifying messages to workers about the need to diversify, says Melendy Lovett, a human-resources vice president at Texas Instruments. It has posted a report on its internal company Web site outlining how its pension policy differs from Enron's, she says. 
Not all employees are embracing the diversification message. Paul Feaser, Diebold's director of corporate services and security, says some older employees at the company plan to take advantage of the company's new relaxed retirement plan policy. Not Mr. Feaser, who is 55 and has been putting half of his contributions into Diebold stock for years. Though the stock has recently fallen from its highs, ""I'm still very satisfied with the profits it's shown,"" he says. ""My diversification comes from other holdings,"" such as stock and bond funds he has invested in on his own. 
Dan Larson, Texas Instruments' director of government and media relations, admits that, ""I'm probably not diversified as much as I should be,"" with half of his 401(k) assets in Texas Instruments stock. But he says Enron hasn't changed his mind about unloading company shares, some of which he bought at a higher price than they are currently valued. While Texas Instruments hasn't taken a stand on legislation that would cap the share of employer-company stocks in 401(k) plans, Mr. Larson personally is concerned that such a bill could force him to sell some of his company stocks prematurely. But any bill is unlikely to force employees to sell shares purchased with their own funds, experts say, and will instead concentrate on company contributions. 
Other companies and business and industry groups also are opposing such legislation. ""What happened in Enron has nothing to do with GE,"" says Jeffrey R. Immelt, GE's chairman, in a recent interview. ""The fact is that having GE stock has done damn well for our employees over the last 10 or 15 years.""

The Analyst Who Warned About Enron
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/29/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Financial analysts who tracked Enron Corp. have taken a pounding for being company ""shills"" and for failing to concede they didn't fully understand the Houston energy-trading concern's complex finances. 
Then there is Daniel Scotto.
The bond analyst in New York for BNP Paribas says he was forced out of the French securities firm because he told his clients in August that Enron securities ""should be sold at all costs and sold now."" That warning came about two weeks after Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling suddenly quit and a couple of months before Enron began the plunge that ended in federal bankruptcy court on Dec. 2. 
Mr. Scotto, 49 years old, issued a research report on Aug. 23 to his clients that lowered his firm's recommendation on Enron to ""neutral"" from ""buy."" He pushed that designation even further by suggesting Enron might be a ""source of funds."" Translation: Consider selling Enron securities to raise money for other investments. 
If he had gone with a ""sell"" rating, he says, ""I'd have been taken out to the guillotine that very day."" 
BNP Paribas declined to elaborate on the reasons for Mr. Scotto's departure. A spokesman says the move ""was completely unrelated to any research he wrote on any company, including Enron."" Spokesman Mark Wisniewski, reading from a statement, added that the securities firm ""is committed to the integrity of its research product"" and said the securities firm was surprised by Mr. Scotto's allegations, as ""he has not raised this issue with us."" 
Mr. Scotto's experience highlights one of the oldest pressure points on Wall Street involving financial analysts, who traditionally act as a filter between investors and the financial markets. During the past decade, Wall Street securities firms increasingly have pushed their research analysts to actively trumpet stocks and bonds, not impartially analyze them. 
The side benefits to the securities firms can be enormous: If an analyst touts a company's securities, the securities firm stands a greater chance at becoming an adviser to that company, and garnering the fees that will follow. Nowadays, analysts can be stars, receiving bonuses of several hundred thousand dollars for helping their firm to win big underwriting deals. Bash the securities of a corporate client, though, and the securities firm could be shut out of lucrative deals. Enron issued billions of dollars worth of securities in recent years, generating huge fees for its financial advisers and bankers. 
Some analysts say Enron wasn't hesitant to complain about research conclusions it didn't like. Some of these people say they now are under orders not to talk about Enron, in view of its stunning collapse. 
For his part, Mr. Scotto says Paribas didn't want him to say negative things about Enron because the securities firm had an investment-banking relationship with the energy trader. 
Still, Mr. Scotto says he followed up his August written report with an investor conference call -- recorded because it took place from the firm's trading floor -- that he says was much blunter. He says he decided to flatly advise his clients to dump Enron securities because Enron's profit margins ""were flattening out and starting to decline. This wasn't a company with hard assets; it was built on paper and highly leveraged."" 
A few days after the brouhaha, Mr. Scotto says he was told ""you're demoted, and we don't think it was a good recommendation or a reasonable one."" 
After the flap and reprimand, Mr. Scotto says, he was put on family leave, at full pay, for 120 days. He says he checked in frequently but was told he wasn't needed back at work and to take time to ""cool off."" He then received a termination letter dated Dec. 5. That letter said, in part, that due to a lack of documentation ""justifying your continued absence from work, as well as the indeterminate nature of your extended leave, BNP Paribas is left with no choice but to terminate your employment effective December 5, 2001."" 
Mr. Scotto says he is looking at other options and has no intention of returning to Wall Street. He once worked at New York investment bank Bear Stearns Cos. and the bond-rating division of Standard & Poor's Corp. He says he is considering writing a whistleblower-type book on how Wall Street ""really works."" He says he wants investors to understand that companies like Enron won't tolerate dissension. ""You couldn't ask hard questions, because it was viewed as offensive,"" he says. 
Consider an April conference call Enron had with analysts. Mr. Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, called a questioner -- upset because the energy concern's balance sheet wasn't available when the quarterly earnings were released -- a vulgar term. 
In another call that followed the release of Enron's disastrous third-quarter financial results in October, Enron's former chairman, Kenneth Lay, cut off an analyst widely regarded as ""short"" on the stock, meaning the analyst's firm was betting on a continued decline in Enron's stock. Mr. Lay moved on to others with more sympathetic questions. 
""All I can say,"" Mr. Scotto says, ""is it's been a long 30 years on Wall Street for me."" He adds that the motto for the Street should be: ""Don't ask, don't tell.""

Accounting for Enron: Enron's Hiring of One Firm to Represent Forty Employees Raises Some Concerns
By Richard B. Schmitt and Tom Hamburger
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

A Washington law firm hired by Enron Corp. is representing about 40 company employees and managers in probes arising from Enron's collapse, raising potential conflicts of interest and concerns that the company is trying to coordinate responses to investigators. 
The law firm, Swidler Berlin Shereff Friedman, represented the late J. Clifford Baxter, the former Enron vice chairman who was found dead in his car near Houston last week, in an apparent suicide. Swidler Berlin also represents a wide range of other Enron employees, including the chiefs of its accounting and risk-management units, among others, people familiar with the firm's involvement said. Any fees the firm receives have to be approved by the New York bankruptcy-court judge overseeing the company's Chapter 11 proceeding.
Legal ethics rules permit -- and corporate targets increasingly seek out -- single law firms to represent multiple employees in a matter. The theory is that so long as the clients are neither subjects nor targets of any investigation, and thus only have an interest in telling the truth, a single law firm is able to represent them aggressively without being conflicted. 
But the system quickly breaks down when one client starts pointing the finger at others. A client might decide to strike a deal with the government that includes giving testimony that implicates other clients. Swidler could have trouble, for instance, if lower-level employees it represents begin to implicate their bosses also represented by the law firm. 
Some companies are required under indemnification agreements to pay for attorneys to represent employees who are caught up in job-related criminal probes. Hiring a single firm is often a cost-efficient approach to meeting that duty. 
But some defense lawyers, who themselves have clients in the Enron case, say the number represented by Enron seems unusually high, and that the chances of conflicts emerging, given the early stages of the Enron inquiries, seem high, too. 
Such agreements, others note, also limit the ability of investigators to question employees because so many of them now have lawyers. 
""Prosecutors hate it. They prefer to play one person off the other. That is harder to do if a single law firm is representing everybody,"" said Stephen Gillers, an ethics specialist at New York University law school. While saying that he wasn't familiar with details of Swidler Berlin's retention, Mr. Gillers added that another common concern is that ""the law firm paid for by the employer will really be working covertly for the employer."" 
Guy Petrillo, a Swidler Berlin partner in New York, said the firm is carefully monitoring the situation, and is fully complying with ethics rules. ""If a conflict of interest presents itself, then our firm will address the conflict and act appropriately,"" he said. Of the idea that Enron might be attempting to coordinate testimony, he added, ""Clients who are called to testify and who elect to do so are under an obligation to testify truthfully. What some call coordination, others call due diligence."" Lawyers for Enron couldn't be immediately reached. 
""Forty is a lot, but not inconceivable,"" said Peter Romatowski, a white-collar specialist at Jones, Davis, Reavis & Pogue in Washington, who isn't representing any Enron entities or employees. A major risk, he added, is that a law firm will be disqualified from representing some, and possibly all the clients, if a conflict emerges later. 
In extreme cases, people ultimately convicted of crimes have challenged their convictions based on concerns that their employer-financed lawyers weren't independent, according to NYU's Mr. Gillers. 
None of Swidler's clients are believed to be the focus of any of the myriad inquiries into Enron's demise. The most senior company executives, moreover, such as former chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay, have retained their own counsel. And not all of Swidler's clients have been sought out for questioning. 
Michael Levy, another Swidler partner, who represented Mr. Baxter, was contacted by investigators from the House Energy and Commerce Committee Wednesday, two days before Mr. Baxter's apparent suicide. The investigators requested an interview but no date had been set. 
Mr. Levy, a former federal prosecutor, previously worked at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, with white-collar specialist Robert Bennett, who currently represents Enron. 
Other Enron managers represented by Swidler include Richard Causey, the company's chief accounting officer, and Richard Buy, its chief risk officer.

THE FALL OF ENRON Firm Did Not Get His Help, President Says Enron: Bush also defends refusal to release energy task force's records. GOP lawmakers concerned about fallout from company's collapse.

WASHINGTON -- President Bush on Monday called the Enron Corp. debacle ""a corporate governance issue . . . not a political issue,"" and he declared unequivocally that his administration provided no help to the now-bankrupt energy company despite large contributions from its employees, directors and political action committee to his presidential campaign. 
""There are some on Capitol Hill who want to politicize this issue,"" Bush said, clearly seeking to inoculate himself against political fallout in the burgeoning controversy.
""And, you know, Enron had made contributions to a lot of people around Washington, D.C. And if they came to this administration looking for help, they didn't find any,"" the president added. 
Bush's comments--his most extensive yet on Enron--came a day after a poll showed that 45% of those surveyed believe Enron had closer ties to Republicans than Democrats; only 10% believed Democrats had closer ties. In the CBS/New York Times poll, more than half also said the Bush administration is either hiding something or lying about the Enron matter. 
President Defends Stance on Records 
Republicans on Capitol Hill are growing deeply concerned over such perceptions, fearful that Enron could derail key Bush priorities--including a national energy policy--as the president enters his second year in office. 
That angst was further fueled by Bush's adamant refusal Monday to disclose White House contacts last year with Enron and other energy industry executives while Vice President Dick Cheney developed the administration's controversial energy policy. 
With nearly a dozen congressional committees looking into various aspects of the Enron collapse, the matter is likely to hang heavily over the administration, even as Bush delivers his State of the Union address tonight and then campaigns for his agenda around the country. 
At a Rose Garden news conference on Monday, the president spoke animatedly as he defended his refusal to release details of Cheney's energy task force. 
Pivoting from his lectern, Bush pointed to the Oval Office and asked rhetorically: ""Should an administration be allowed to have private conversations in this office without everybody knowing about it?"" 
With fervor, the president answered his own question, saying: 
""This is part of how you make decisions, is to call people in and say, 'What's your opinion? What's your opinion on stem cell? What's your opinion on energy? What's your opinion on the war?' "" 
Demands by Congress for such information amount to an ""encroachment on the executive branch's ability to conduct business,"" Bush said. 
""We're not going to let the ability for us to discuss matters between ourselves to become eroded. It's not only important for us, for this administration, it's an important principle for future administrations,"" he continued. 
""In order for me to be able to get good, sound opinions, those who offer me opinions, or offer the vice president opinions, must know that every word they say is not going to be put into the public record,"" the president added. 
Friendship With Lay Poses Another Problem 
The General Accounting Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress, is threatening to sue the administration to gain access to those task force records. 
In his State of the Union address tonight, Bush is not expected to mention Enron directly. He may call for pension reform--an Enron-related topic, since the company's bankruptcy left thousands of its employees with retirement plans that are all but worthless. 
The president made his remarks on Enron and the looming legal battle with the GAO during a wide-ranging joint news conference with visiting Afghan interim leader Hamid Karzai. 
As the repercussions of Enron's collapse continue to spread, the White House has become increasingly defensive--in part because of campaign contributions to Bush and other Republicans, and in part because of a friendship between the president and Enron's just-ousted chairman, Kenneth L. Lay. 
It was unclear to whom Bush was referring Monday when he accused ""some"" of seeking to politicize the issue. The committees probing the Enron matter in the House are chaired by Republicans. 
Bush's comment about contacts between Enron and his administration was a reference to previously disclosed calls from Lay to Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. Both Cabinet secretaries said they did nothing after the calls that could be construed as helping Enron. 
The Houston-based company, the seventh-largest in the country until its sudden demise, has been the source of large campaign donations for the last decade or more. While its employees, directors and political action committee gave to Democrats as well, 74% of nearly $6 million in various types of contributions went to Republicans. Bush personally raised more than $114,000 in PAC and individual contributions from Enron in the 1999-2000 election cycle. Bush's inauguration fund received $300,000 from the company. 
'This Is Not a Political Issue' 
Presidential counselor Karen Hughes, one of Bush's top advisors, further sought on Monday to distance the president from Lay, whom Bush had once nicknamed ""Kenny Boy."" 
In an interview on CNN, Hughes said Bush was ""understandably outraged"" over Enron's accounting practices and treatment of its employees, and she quoted him as having said: ""This stinks."" 
During the Rose Garden session, Bush characterized Enron's collapse as ""a corporate governance issue. This is a business problem that our country must deal with and must fix--that is, full disclosure of liabilities, full understanding of the effects of decisions on pension funds, reform of the pension system, perhaps."" 
""This is not a political issue,"" he added. 
The president said Enron ""went bust"" for one simple reason. ""It seems like to me--and we'll wait for the facts to come out--it went broke because there was not full disclosure of finances.""

Politics & Policy
Enron Collapse Has Congress Backing Off Deregulation --- Better Financial Reporting, Tighter Accounting Rules Top Bipartisan Call for Changes
By Michael Schroeder and Cassell Bryan-Low
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Enron Corp.'s collapse has Congress taking its finger off the deregulation button, as members instead suddenly queue up to push for new controls on the financial community. 
A dizzying array of bills seek tougher regulation on financial disclosures, auditor conflicts, insider trading and pension investments.
Most of them may fail to reach floor votes, but in the new atmosphere what doesn't become law could well get adopted instead by industry regulators. 
Though Democrats are sponsoring most of the bills, prominent Republicans normally against regulation are saying they favor stepped-up oversight from federal regulators and industries' self-policing bodies -- if only to blunt the drive for new regulatory laws. And the Senate Finance Committee's top Republican, Iowa's Charles Grassley, is calling for a crackdown on corporate tax shelters and protections for worker retirement savings in Enron's wake. 
The complicated scandal also has muted the antiregulatory rhetoric of the Bush administration, even on unrelated issues. But powerful business groups are mobilizing to scuttle any new regulations, or at least soften them. 
Improved financial reporting and tighter accounting rules top the bipartisan calls for changes. 
For instance, one narrow proposal with wide appeal is Sen. Jean Carnahan's bill to overhaul the system for company executives' reports of their insider-trading transactions. News accounts of Enron executives' sales of its stock, before the energy-trading company's dramatic demise, has spotlighted that issue. 
""Enron executives told the world the company was on solid footing, while at the same time they sold off their own stock,"" Mrs. Carnahan, a Missouri Democrat, said in a statement. ""Such a dramatic insider selloff would have been a big warning sign to investors, but this information was not readily accessible to them."" 
Among the current system's problems is that insiders enjoy lax filing deadlines; weeks-old information isn't of much use to small investors. 
The Carnahan bill proposes that insiders report trades the day they occur, and file them electronically to the Securities and Exchange Commission so that the SEC can immediately post the information on its Web site. 
Currently, forms filed by corporate executives, directors and other insiders reporting the sale or purchase of their own companies' stock are among the few reports for which electronic filing is optional. 
Public companies have been required to file other corporate documents, such as quarterly and annual reports, on the SEC's Edgar system since 1996, but at least 90% of insider-trading forms still arrive by mail. 
Companies and their insiders have argued that immediate electronic filing creates an unnecessary burden. 
Some corporate analysts have questioned whether the SEC's current database could handle the added volume of insider filings. About 350,000 forms are filed annually, according to Edgar Online, Norwalk, Conn. 
""The idea of more electronic filing and greater dissemination is a good thing,"" says Stuart Kaswell, general counsel of the Securities Industry Association. 
But, he adds, ""We need to make sure the reporting time period is realistic . . . so individuals are able to gather and report information accurately."" 
If the Carnahan bill fails, the SEC has the authority to impose such new reporting requirements. 
With accounting irregularities getting much of the blame in Enron's fall, Democratic Sens. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Jon Corzine of New Jersey propose to restrict accounting firms from offering other services to their audit clients. 
Their bill has the support of Senate Majority Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota; it would prohibit accounting firms from auditing companies whose executives recently worked for the auditor. 
Just over a year ago, the accounting industry successfully fought off a similar conflict-of-interest ban that former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt advocated. 
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants opposes the new measure, and argues that no evidence suggests that a ban on such relationships would have made a difference in the Enron case. 
AICPA President Barry Melancon says he backs new SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt's plan to overhaul the existing system of industry self-regulation, to create an independent oversight panel. 
Mr. Pitt, who represented big accounting firms as a private attorney before his SEC appointment by President Bush, says he is developing an industry-funded response to the accounting problems, rather than beefing up the SEC staff and budget to directly regulate the accounting industry. 
Although the chairman has said he would work with Congress if a consensus develops for some accounting legislation, he noted that the SEC could approve new disclosure rules and oversee the new private-regulatory body more quickly than Congress would get new legislation to Mr. Bush's desk. 
The Enron investigation also has revived the debate about whether complicated derivatives investments should be regulated. 
In late 2000, Congress exempted from nearly any regulation these over-the-counter derivatives, which are contracts whose value is derived from the underlying assets such as commodities or currencies. Enron led the massive lobbying effort on Capitol Hill and, with the exemption, escaped federal oversight of its trading activities. 
Rep. Peter DeFazio, a liberal Democrat from Oregon, says he is drafting legislation to require detailed disclosure. 
Derivatives played a big role in Enron's alleged misrepresentation of its true financial condition. 
Mr. DeFazio is joining with Reps. Dennis Kucinich, an Ohio Democrat, and Bernie Sanders, a Vermont Independent, on two other bills to change corporate auditing and protect worker pensions. 
Enron employees' losses in retirement funds, heavily invested in the company's now-worthless stock, have spawned at least a half-dozen pension-reform bills. 
Sens. Corzine and Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, have teamed on a bill aimed at more-diversified worker accounts. 
It would limit to 20% the investment employees can have in any one stock in their 401(k)s. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups oppose pension changes, contending they should not be punished because of the misdeeds of one company. 
They also are pressing Congress for legislation to shield from liability those companies that hire advisers to help employees develop retirement plans. 
Their argument: Employers don't give investment advice to employees for fear of being sued if the advice leads to big losses, but such advice could have kept Enron workers from relying so heavily on Enron stock.

to old ones, as lawmakers react to the unfolding story of the fallen
energy giant and its auditor. A sampling:

""The stunning collapse of a Fortune 10 company in such a short period

02/01/2002
Financial Executive's News
Copyright c 2002 by the Institute of Management & Administration (IOMA). Reproduction without permission is strictly prohibited.

""The stunning collapse of a Fortune 10 company in such a short period of time gives pause to all of us who care about financial reporting."" So said Robert Herdman, the new chief accountant of the SEC, as he spoke about the Enron debacle at a recent AICPA conference. 
In his speech, Herdman noted that he and other SEC staff members are barred from commenting on the specifics of the energy company's troubles, due to the commission's pending probe. Even so, numerous speakers at this AICPA conference referred to the problematic role of Andersen LLP, in what has become the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. In particular, they referred to the pattern of misstatements in Enron's financial reports. Apparently, these are not fine-point controversies over judgment calls in gray areas, but violations of fundamental accounting principles.
Breaking Basic Rules 
In mid-October, for example, Enron announced a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. According to The Wall Street Journal, Enron said the reduction developed from its decision to unwind certain transactions with some limited partnerships. Shortly thereafter, the company announced the original accounting for the transactions violated GAAP. 
Details: Starting in 2000, the company issued shares of its own common stock to four ""special purpose entities."" In exchange, it received a note receivable. In doing so, Enron said it increased both its notes-receivable assets and shareholder equity, a move it later admitted was an accounting error. 
Explanation: Under GAAP, the payment a company receives when issuing stock only counts as equity if it is cash. Upshot: Enron's 2000 audited financial statements overstated the company's notes-receivable assets and shareholder equity by $172 million. Meanwhile, Enron's 2001 unaudited statements overstated them by $828 million. 
""It is basic accounting that you don't record equity until you get cash, and a note doesn't count as cash,"" remarked Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant for the SEC, in an interview in The Wall Street Journal. ""The question this raises is: How did both [the Andersen] partners and the manager on this audit miss this simple Accounting 101 rule?"" 
De'ja Vu All Over Again 
Unfortunately, Andersen's sign-off on these accounting decisions has a familiar ring. Indeed, multiple accounting disasters at large companies have hit every Big Five auditor in recent years. But at Andersen, the reporting problems at Enron appear remarkably similar to those at former client Sunbeam, another large bankruptcy. 
Enron, for example, reported net income of $105 million for 1997, a figure the company reduced last November to $9 million. Here, Enron said the primary cause of this restatement was $51 million in audit adjustments and reclassifications that its auditor had proposed in 1997 but had later determined to be immaterial. Key point: Cumulatively, those immaterial adjustments totaled nearly half of the company's 1997 net income. 
At Sunbeam, this issue of immateriality was remarkably similar. Reason: According to the SEC's May settlement order, Andersen's auditors routinely dismissed numerous violations of GAAP as immaterial. But eventually, these piled up to produce significant distortions in Sunbeam's financial statements. Altogether, they made this barely solvent company look profitable. 
In May, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit against five former Sunbeam executives and the Andersen partner in charge of the audit, accusing them of engaging in financial fraud. 
Key point: In certain situations, the SEC says intentional immaterial misstatements are unlawful. Reason: When immaterial misstatements are combined with other misstatements, they can render the financial statements, as a whole, to be materially misleading. Upshot: Under GAAP, misstatements aren't immaterial simply because they fall beneath a numerical threshold. 
Response From the Accounting Establishment 
In his speech at the AICPA conference, Herdman primarily focused on preventing future accounting debacles. In this activity, he praised the Big Five for their pledge to submit specific recommendations to the SEC for improving corporate financial disclosures, in the wake of things gone awry with Enron's financial reporting. 
The Big Five submitted this document on December 31. Available on the SEC Web site, the document offers reporting improvement suggestions for: (1) management's discussion and analysis of financial condition (MD&A); (2) disclosures for the liquidity and capital resources of off-balance sheet arrangements; (3) disclosures of trading activities that include nonexchange traded contracts accounted for a fair market value; and (4) disclosures about relationships and transactions with persons who are not independent third parties. 
Meanwhile, Herdman also praised the AICPA for ""detailing initiatives that are designed to improve financial disclosure and audit performance in the near term."" As announced by James G. Castellano, AICPA chairman, and Barry Melancon, AICPA president and CEO, these include: 
An exposure draft covering a new audit standard for detecting fraud, including more precise guidance on auditing for material misstatements due to fraud (first quarter of 2002); 
Guidance for company managements and audit committees on the new measures for deterring fraud, such as internal control procedures; 
Revised auditor standards on review of quarterly financial statements (first quarter of 2002); and 
An exposure draft focusing on the risks of material misstatements. Technically, this draft will detail improved audit standards for guiding auditors through the audit process. But, its heart will be an approach for assessing the risks of material misstatements.

Whistle-Blowers
To Tell the Truth Sherron Watkins gave Enron a piece of her mind-- and investigators a smoking gun
Samantha Miller Gabrielle Cosgriff in Houston

On Aug. 14 Sherron Watkins sat down at her computer and began typing a scathing--and now famous--memo to her boss. ""I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals,"" she wrote in the missive to Enron chairman Kenneth Lay. Worried about the wisdom of such blunt talk, the 42-year-old vice president for corporate development sought out colleagues and got mixed advice on whether she should send the note. But her mother did not waffle. ""I told her,"" says Shirley Klein Harrington, 67, ""to stick with her convictions."" 
Watkins did just that, and the seven-page memo has become a smoking gun in the unfolding investigation of alleged financial chicanery at Enron and its accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. On Dec. 2 the formerly high-flying Houston corporation became the largest company in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy. Watkins's memo, made public on Jan. 14 by congressional leaders who found it buried in 40 boxes of subpoenaed documents, had proven prescient. Now, more than a dozen federal agencies and Capitol Hill committees are probing the mushrooming morass--the latest news being that Enron and Andersen employees continued to shred documents even after it was clear that Congress was opening what could become a criminal investigation.
More important to hundreds of employees who saw their retirement packages collapse with the failing stock price, Watkins's memo was also key evidence that Lay and other Enron execs knew about the company's precarious finances well before they alerted the staff or the public. ""She's one of the few ethical bright spots,"" says Barbara Shook, a Houston energy-industry analyst, of Watkins. Adds Watkins's sister, homemaker Julie Reagan, 40: ""She couldn't believe what people were getting away with, and she didn't think it was right. I'm so proud of her I'm about to pop."" 
Watkins, who lives in Houston with husband Rick, 51, an executive for a Canadian oil and gas firm, and their daughter Marion, 2, doesn't regret sending the memo. ""The die was already cast,"" she says through her lawyer, Philip Hilder. ""My take on it changed nothing."" Life at Enron, where she is still employed, has been ""extremely painful, as it is for everybody, with the company under fire,"" she adds. Watkins has been subpoenaed to testify before the Securities and Exchange Commission, and more subpoenas are likely. 
In and out of the office, Watkins has left a variety of impressions--some good and some bad, but all forceful. Friends say they value her sometimes rough honesty: She once told her sister Julie that a picture frame Julie had given her was ""the tackiest thing I've ever seen."" Coworkers see her as hard-driving, with one Enron employee likening her to ""a bull in a china shop."" Her former secretary Wilma Williams, 60, disagrees. ""Sherron wasn't abrasive; she just expected people to do their job,"" Williams recalls. 
Her frankness and salty language even had some coworkers buzzing that she was a New Yorker. In fact, Watkins was raised in the Houston suburb of Tomball, Texas. (Singer Lyle Lovett is her second cousin.) Her mother, a retired accounting teacher divorced from her daughters' attorney father, Dan C. Smith, 67, encouraged Sherron to go into accounting. ""It's an area in which women can be accepted on an equal basis,"" Harrington says. Watkins earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Texas. ""She was brilliant,"" says friend Anne Benolken, 42. ""You know the way girls in college often act more stupid than they are or try not to make waves? Not Sherron, she'd always stir the pot."" 
Watkins began her career as an auditor for Arthur Andersen. She then moved to a firm in New York City, MG Trade Finance Group, before returning to Houston to work for up-and-coming energy wholesaler Enron in 1993. In 1997 she wed Rick, whom she had met at Houston's First Presbyterian Church. 
By last summer Watkins had come to suspect that Enron, which FORTUNE ranked as the seventh-largest company in the U.S. last year, was a house of cards. When Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling resigned in August, chairman Lay invited employees to forward any concerns to him. Watkins sent him the first page of her memo detailing her uneasiness about ""funny"" accounting to hide company losses. ""Has Enron become a risky place to work?"" she asked. 
On Aug. 22 Watkins met with Lay, who told the company's law firm to look into the matter. The firm reported in October that the practices might make the company look bad but did not appear to be illegal. But Watkins's fears rapidly came to pass. Since December, Enron has fired more than 4,000 employees, and thousands of others have lost much of their life savings. Watkins was fortunate in having sold some stock in 1999 to buy her house. 
Watkins doesn't relish the prospect of playing a pivotal and highly visible role in the ongoing investigation. ""The only good thing that might come out of all this,"" she says, ""is there may be certain reforms so that there won't be another Enron.""

Two 'Evildoers' Meet at the Bar of Justice

Re ""Enron Auditor Says Fired Partner Drove Shredding,"" Jan. 25: The difference between ""evildoers"" and the sheep who follow became apparent last week. David Duncan, former partner of the Andersen accounting firm, appeared before Congress in an expensive suit, protected by lawyers, and refused to answer any questions that were put to him, and he walked out. 
On the sheep side, John Walker Lindh was brought to court in chains, sporting the latest in prison jumpsuits, and was returned to his maximum security cell (""U.S. Talib Goes to Court on Conspiracy Counts,"" Jan. 25). My guess is that Duncan will cut a deal and serve no time for ratting out the other Enron evildoers. And Lindh will be on the fast track for life in a federal prison.

Johnny the Kid came from good stock. As an adventurous young lad he chose the excitement of riding with the notorious Osama bin Laden gang. The sheriff and his posse combed the hills until they rounded up the gang--minus the leader. The townspeople were outraged to find Johnny hiding out with the band of outlaws. They found the Kid guilty, by public opinion, and hung him in the town square for all to see. 
Meanwhile, across town, due to lack of funds, the bank of Enron was shutting its doors. As the local ranchers were pounding on the front door demanding their money, the banker and his assistants were stuffing their satchels with cash. The dirty sidewinders ducked out the back door and caught the first stage out of town. 
The sheriff and his deputies were torn as they formed a posse to give chase. They were good pals of the banker, for he had contributed greatly in getting them their jobs. So, when they returned empty-handed, saying they lost the trail, the townsfolk eyed them suspiciously. Rumor has it that the banker settled in another town and opened a new bank. 
To be continued. . . .

Ain't that the pot calling the kettle black? 
While the actions of Enron and its auditor Andersen are deplorable, I can't help but be amused at our government's posturing and outrage. The U.S. government is the master of creative accounting. Billions are accounted for off balance sheets and the financial condition of the country is grossly misrepresented. 
Unfortunately, average Americans don't appear to be overly concerned with the big picture as long as they get theirs and life continues along in the same pattern. I fear that one day the charade of governmental accounting will catch up to us (possibly when Social Security goes bankrupt) and, like Enron investors, the public will be left wondering how this could have happened.

It was a fast, great decision to freeze the assets of the backers of terrorism. The administration would hardly make the same decision against the executive class no matter how crooked and conniving members of the Enron hierarchy were to their own workers. 
It would be too simple to freeze the assets on stock traded as of a set date in volume over 1,000 shares and give that money back to the pension fund. It would certainly take fewer lawyers, who are about to drain away whatever is left.

As a voting American about to be stiffed for your bankrupt pal's losses, I have a right to know.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

"LNG Terminal in Freeport","Tom,

As I stated earlier, we have not given much thought to an LNG terminal in the Freeport area as we anticipated that the basis market would be in the minus $.20 range.  If you add the $.05 to $.10 to build a pipeline from the terminal to an interconnect, such a project has trouble competing with others on the table.   After talking with Daren and yourself, it may well be worth doing some more research to get better projections of what those numbers might be.  I would like to take this further and stack such a project up to others we are evaluating.  As you stated,  we need to do a better analysis of the pipeline situation in the Freeport area to evaluate the economics of the project.  Please inform me as to if and how we should proceed with this matter.

Thank You,

Enron Gets Bids for Stake in Trading Unit --- Citigroup, UBS, BP Make Offers, but J.P. Morgan Pulls Out of the Running

In a small but vital first step toward resurrecting its trading operations, Enron Corp. received formal bids for a majority stake in its energy-trading arm from Citigroup Inc., UBS AG and BP PLC, people familiar with the matter said. 
They said there was no bid from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., one of Enron's largest creditors, which had been weighing an offer for the unit.
It was unclear late yesterday how many other bids, if any, had been received for the wholesale trading business, once considered Enron's flagship operation. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and American International Group Inc. also had been looking at the unit. 
Under bankruptcy-court rules governing the sale, the initial bids were submitted on a confidential basis, and will be used in an ""auction"" Thursday, when the company's advisers are expected to press bidders to raise their offers. The results will be disclosed Friday. 
While Citigroup and UBS were known to be contemplating bids, the interest from BP, the London-based global oil company, hadn't been widely known. A spokesman for BP couldn't be reached for comment yesterday evening. 
Houston-based Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection on Dec. 11, gaining a reprieve from creditors as it seeks to reorganize. Enron's advisers at Blackstone Group and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP had hoped to cement a ""stalking horse"" bid prior to yesterday's deadline, which would have set a floor for the bidding. They came close to finalizing such a deal with Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney investment-banking unit, but it wasn't completed in time. 
It isn't clear why J.P. Morgan pulled out of the running. In late December, the bank disclosed that its total exposure to Enron was roughly $2.6 billion, far higher than the $900 million that it had originally disclosed. An official at the bank declined to comment. 
Citigroup, also one of Enron's largest creditors, hasn't disclosed its total exposure to Enron, which is believed to be at least $900 million. 
Spokesmen for Citigroup and UBS declined to discuss the auction. A spokeswoman for Enron said that the company ""did receive multiple bids,"" but she declined to discuss them, saying they were ""under seal."" 
Enron and its advisers have argued that bringing in a credit-worthy partner is vital to restoring confidence in its core energy-trading unit, called EnronOnline. The unit used to trade hundreds of different types of commodities contracts, and claimed to be a dominant player in the North American electricity and natural-gas markets. Following Enron's rapid downward spiral and its Chapter 11 filing, trading nearly ground to a halt, as Enron's trading counterparties backed away from executing new trades with the unit. 
When Enron unveiled a roadmap for its reorganization late last year, it proposed a joint venture for its trading operations under which an outside firm with a strong balance sheet would receive at least 51% of the unit. 
The company's advisers have said that they didn't anticipate receiving a significant cash bid for this majority stake, indicating that the payoff to Enron creditors would come from Enron's residual share of future profits from the joint venture. 
Separately, at a hearing yesterday afternoon in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan, a group of Enron creditors led by Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Corp. pressed Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez to move the bankruptcy case from New York to Houston, where Enron and many of its creditors are based. The creditors argued that it would be more economical and convenient to hear the case in Texas. 
Enron opposes a change of venue. Judge Gonzalez indicated that he intends to rule by the end of the week. 
An Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company doesn't plan to announce its fourth-quarter results until March. In the past, the company disclosed its financial results shortly after the close of the quarter.

BP Bids for Some Enron Assets, May Seek Others (Update1)
2002-01-08 09:50 (New York)

     (Adds that BP many be interested in bidding for other Enron
assets in first paragraph, further details throughout.)

     London, Jan. 8 (Bloomberg) -- BP Plc, the top U.S. natural
gas producer, said it bid $25 million for certain assets of Enron
Corp. and may seek others if this week's auction for the bankrupt
energy-trading business hits a snag.
     BP wants computerized systems for back-office functions
related to trading natural gas and electricity in Thursday's
auction, a BP spokesman said. A court hearing to review the
results is set for Friday.
     Should the current auction fail, ``we might be willing to
negotiate on a non-binding basis to acquire other parts of Enron's
assets,'' said Roddy Kennedy, BP's chief spokesman in London.
     BP Chief Executive Lord Browne, who has spent more than $100
billion on takeovers since 1998, has said that the company will
remain active in acquisitions as oil prices slide and energy
demand slows. The London-based company hasn't specified the Enron
assets for which it may bid, Kennedy said.
     Enron, once the world's largest trader of natural gas and
electricity, needs cash to help pay more than $40 billion of debt
amassed through transactions that the Securities and Exchange
Commission is now investigating. It aims to continue trading
energy even after selling control of the unit.
     In November, Browne said BP wasn't interested in bidding for
Enron or for a stake in the business.
     That was before Enron filed the biggest-ever U.S. bankruptcy
case last month, after rating agencies classified its debt as
``junk,'' inhibiting operations and leading Dynegy Inc. to drop a
$23 billion rescue bid.
     BP shares recently traded at 528 pence, down 0.7 percent or
3.5 pence on the London Stock Exchange, where they have fallen by
2.2 percent in the past year.

Enron Gets Bids for Control of Energy-Trading Unit (Update2)
2002-01-08 07:32 (New York)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph, further BP comment
in sixth, seventh, UBS comment in 10th paragraph).

     London, Jan. 8 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which filed the
biggest-ever U.S. bankruptcy case last month, said it received
multiple bids for a controlling stake in its energy-trading unit,
once the world's largest dealer of natural gas and electricity.
     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't comment on the size of
the bids or who made them, ahead of an auction on Thursday. BP Plc
said it bid $25 million for Enron assets, primarily information-
technology systems for energy trading. Enron also received offers
from Citigroup Inc. and UBS AG, the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing unidentified sources.
     The Houston-based company aims to continue trading energy,
its primary business, even after it's sold control of the unit to
an outsider. Enron needs cash to help pay more than $40 billion of
debt it amassed through financial structures now under
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     ``They need someone to put them through the laundry and make
them clean, and someone with a high degree of industry
expertise,'' said Shelley Mansfield, energy manager at ADM
Investor Services International in London.
     Enron in November said it would sell as much as $8 billion
worth of non-trading assets such as its broadband
telecommunications network, a power plant in India and an electric
utility. The company sought protection in U.S. courts after rating
agencies classified its debt as ``junk,'' inhibiting operations
and leading Dynegy Inc. to drop a $23 billion rescue bid.
     BP, the third-largest publicly traded oil company, said it
would be interested in bidding for other unspecified Enron assets
if the current auction process hits a snag.

                          BP Interest

     ``In the event that the current process to sell the business
breaks down, we might be willing to negotiate to acquire other
parts of Enron's assets,'' said Roddy Kennedy, a BP spokesman. A
court hearing is set for Friday to review the results of
Thursday's auction.
      J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., which had been considering an offer
for the energy-trading business, didn't submit a bid, the Wall
Street Journal reported. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and American
International Group Inc. were looking at the unit, the paper said.
     Enron shares yesterday rose 2 cents, or 3 percent, to 68
cents. The stock has lost 99 percent of its value in the past
year. BP shares were down 0.5 pence at 531 pence, while UBS shares
dipped by 45 centimes, or 0.5 percent, to 82.65 Swiss francs.
Citigroup stock yesterday declined 61 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$51.39.
     UBS spokeswoman Monika Dunant declined to comment.

Winner of Enron energy ops expected Friday; Sempra may win metals unit bidding

01/07/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - Enron Corp's financial advisors are overseeing bids for the troubled energy group's core energy trading business, and a final winner for the business is likely to be announced by a bankruptcy court on Friday, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. 
In a separate negotiation, Enron has agreed to sell its metals trading arm to San Diego-based energy merchant Sempra Energy for an undisclosed sum, company sources told AFX news on condition of anonymity.
Enron wants to divest a majority stake in its core energy trading business and form a joint venture from the assets enabling it to maintain a minority stake in the venture. 
""The bids were due in today. I don't think a decision is due until the end of the week, and until then I can't see anybody talking about it,"" said a spokesman for the Blackstone Group in New York. 
Blackstone is acting as a financial advisor to Enron. 
The Blackstone spokesman declined to identify any of the prospective bidders , but weekend media reports said that Citigroup, one of Enron's key creditors, and Swiss banking group UBS AG have both expressed an interest in the business. 
The winning bidder will be announced by a bankruptcy court on Friday following a private auction which is due to take place on Thursday. 
Separately, Enron was expected to formally announce the winning suitor of its metal business before Christmas, but was delayed because of difficulties in unravelling the group's complex corporate structure, the Financial Times reported last week. 
The deal for the group was completed as early before Christmas and is only being formalised, the source said. 
Sempra is said to have beat out potential buyers Glencore, the Swiss commodities trader, HSBC, and Goldman Sachs. 
The London-based business would also include operations in the US, sources said. 
Enron could not be contacted at the time of reporting.

Judge To Decide On Enron Bankruptcy Venue This Week
By Kathy Chu

01/08/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
(This was originally published late Monday.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal bankruptcy judge will decide by the end of this week whether to transfer Enron Corp's (ENE) complex chapter 11 proceeding to Houston.
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, said it will take him a few days to decide whether to move venue for the largest bankruptcy case in corporate history - as some Enron creditors have requested due to the energy trading company's large concentration of assets and employees in Texas. 
Legal experts have said that it is unlikely that the motions will be approved, and at a lengthy, standing-room-only hearing Monday, Judge Gonzalez repeatedly expressed his concern at changing venue for a case that is more than a month old. 
""Time has passed and things have had to be done,"" said Gonzalez. ""...if you had to choose between the stability of the case and transferring it, then the choice is stability."" 
Since Dec. 2, when Enron and its units began filing for bankruptcy, the court has approved first-day motions for employee compensation and for a preliminary round of debtor-in-possession financing. An official 15-member unsecured creditors' committee has also been appointed by the U.S. Trustee. 
An attorney with the Carter Ledyard Milburn law firm - which represents a consortium of oil concerns led by Dunhill Resources, creditors hoping to get the case transferred - said no legal developments have occurred in recent weeks that would ""prejudice"" Enron should the case be heard in Texas. 
Two of the 30 Enron units that have sought court protection in the last month are based in New York - giving the parent company jurisdiction to file in the Big Apple - while the other affiliates are in Houston. 
The New York units, Enron Metals & Commodity Inc. and Enron Federal Solutions Inc., account for less than 1% of the company's overall $45 billion in assets, according to court filings. 
Monday, lawyers for both sides found consensus on one legal point: Enron's bankruptcy case should be in the court where it would be most efficiently and economically administered. 
But beyond this, the parties agreed to disagree during a contentious five-hour court proceeding. 
Those supporting the case's transfer to Texas - including Enron's 401(k) plan holders, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), El Paso Energy and Dunhill Resources - argued that the company's creditors and employees would be best served if the proceedings take place in Texas. 
Otherwise, ""if you are relying on Enron Metals to maintain venue in New York, then this is truly the tail wagging the dog,"" Rhett Campbell, Dunhill Resources attorney, told Judge Gonzalez at the court hearing. 
If the case remained in Manhattan, it would be an ""imposition"" on Houston creditors who would likely be unable to attend the hearings, he added. 
Also, Campbell noted that during a recent deposition, Enron Metals' comptroller admitted that the subsidiary reported $175 million in liabilities, even though $100 million of this debt came from an unrelated financing deal with Islamic entity Al Raghid. The deal was with Enron affiliates other than Enron Metals, making the unit's ties to New York more ""tenuous"" than previously believed, he said. 
But Enron attorney Martin Bienenstock, of Weil, Gotshal & Manges law firm, disputed these claims, saying that the company's decision to file in New York was ""proper."" 
Enron Metals, purchased in July 2000 for $450 million, ""is a real company, with real revenues"" of more than $500 million a year, regardless of the Al Raghid transactions, he said. 
The energy-trading giant, being an international corporation, sought New York court protection because 11 of its 20 largest unsecured claims - belonging to a handful of financial institutions - are in New York, according to Bienenstock. Most of Enron's cadre of lawyers and financial advisers, in addition to the company's DIP lenders, are also in Manhattan. 
If the case is transferred to Houston - a move opposed by Enron's official creditors' committee as well as most major financial institutions - it would be ""a convenient panacea for a minority,"" Bienenstock said. 
Currently, about 3,000 of Enron's 19,000 employees are in Houston, while the others work around the world. This compares with a Houston staff of 7,500 and overall employees of 25,000 before the distressed company and its units filed for Chapter 11 protection Dec. 2. 
Enron Corp. can trace many of its problems back to a loss of shareholder confidence, prompted largely by the mid-October announcement of a massive third-quarter loss and an equity write-down of $1.2 billion. Dynegy, which stepped in to save the embattled company, backed out of a merger after Enron disclosed more financial woes.

Enron fights attempt to change venue --- Many creditors seek move from N.Y. to Houston

Enron Corp. is fighting a push by creditors to move the former energy trading giant's bankruptcy protection case from New York to its hometown of Houston. 
The vast majority of Enron's creditors, aggrieved parties and even the company's executives are based in Texas, Rhett Campbell, a lawyer speaking on behalf of creditors seeking to move the case to Houston, argued yesterday in court. Enron filed for Chapter 11 protection Dec. 2 in New York.
Judge Arthur Gonzalez said he expects to rule by the end of the week. 
Campbell told the judge there are 309 creditors in New York and 2,169 in Texas. While acknowledging some large banks, particularly J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., have hefty claims, he said, ""It's easier for big banks to go to Houston than it is for the thousands of creditors to get to New York."" 
Citigroup Inc. of New York, Barclays Bank PLC of London and Dresdner Bank AG of Frankfurt are among the creditors opposed to changing venues. 
Other large creditors, such as energy traders Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Corp., and smaller ones, like the Southern Ute Indian Tribe of Colorado, believe it would be more convenient and economical to hear the case near the location of many Enron creditors and assets. Dynegy and El Paso are based in Houston. 
In a motion filed by Dynegy and other creditors, lawyers also say there is ""an emotional interest to be served"" by moving the case to Houston, where thousands of Enron employees were laid off and many more witnessed the rapid evaporation of their retirement plans when the company's stock plummeted. 
Also on Monday, at least two companies were expected to make bids for a majority stake in Enron's wholesale energy trading unit, a lawyer for the company said. 
Enron lawyer Martin Bienenstock, of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP in New York, said he expected Enron's core business, which needs a creditworthy partner to resume operations, to fetch ""probably two bids or more"" by the 4 p.m. deadline. 
There was no immediate word by early evening yesterday on how many bids were filed. An auction is scheduled for Thursday. 
With regard to the change-of-venue hearing, analysts said creditors are also hoping for a more favourable hearing in Houston, where the economy has suffered as a result of Enron's demise. 
Lawyers for Enron, and a handful of creditors opposed to relocating the proceedings, presented their side late yesterday. Bienenstock argued that it would be less expensive and more convenient if the case were administered in New York, home to the armies of lawyers and bankers working on both sides. 
Under U.S. rules of bankruptcy procedure, a case may be transferred from one district court to another ""in the interest of justice or for the convenience of the parties."" 
The basic criteria considered by judges ruling on previous change-of-venue motions have been: the proximity of creditors, debtors and witnesses; the location of assets and the cost. 
""Judges have considerable discretion in making the call,"" said Robert Christmas, a bankruptcy expert with the law firm Nixon Peabody LLP in New York. 
Christmas said moving the case to Houston would create ""an atmosphere of pressure that does not exist in New York."" 
""That gives creditors the ability to have unhappy employees tramping around the courthouse,"" he said.

Enron -3: Venue Change For Month-Old Case Worries Judge

BP offers 25 mln usd for Enron's IT systems linked to gas, electricity trading

01/08/2002
AFX News

LONDON (AFX) - BP PLC said it offered 25 mln usd for some of Enron Corp's assets. 
A BP spokesman said the assets for which it is bidding largely comprise the IT systems for back-office and administrative functions linked to Enron's natural gas and electricity trading operations.
Three weeks will be needed to examine the feasibility of the project from a technical and commercial point of view, BP said. 
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Enron had received formal bids for a majority stake in its energy-trading arm from Citigroup Inc, UBS AG and BP, citing people familiar with the matter. 
It said the results of the bidding will be released on Friday.

SAN ANTONIO (AP) - Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Tony Sanchez on Monday called for combining the state's two leading utility regulation agencies into a single body whose commissioners are elected by voters. 
Under Sanchez's proposal, the Texas Railroad Commission and the state Public Utility Commission would be joined to form the Texas Public Service Commission.
The railroad commission, with three elected members, regulates oil, natural gas and pipelines, while the PUC, whose three members are appointed by the governor, watches over electricity issues and telecommunications. 
He said having a commission answering to voters would be especially important now that Texas has deregulated its electric utilities. 
""Consolidating these agencies will do more to protect consumers, improve accountability and save tax dollars,"" he said at a noontime campaign appearance in San Antonio. ""It is time people had a voice in determining who gets to decide rates for their essential services."" 
Dan Morales, who last week challenged Sanchez and two others in the Democratic primary, did not return phone calls Monday regarding his opponent's utilities plan. A spokesman for the former attorney general said he was campaigning in the Rio Grande Valley. 
Sanchez, a multimillionaire businessman from Laredo, made several references to conflicts of interest built into the existing regulatory scheme, comparing it to a coyote being left in charge of a henhouse. 
He mentioned no one by name, but indirectly reminded listeners of the case of former Enron Corp. executive Max Yzaguirre, who was named PUC chairman in June by Gov. Rick Perry. 
A day after Yzaguirre's appointment, Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, made a $25,000 political contribution to Perry. 
The governor's office has steadfastly defended the appointment, saying Yzaguirre was qualified to hold the post and that no conflict of interest existed. 
Perry, running unopposed for the Republican nomination for governor, would face the winner of the Democratic primary. In addition to Sanchez and Morales, Waxahachie businessman Bill Lyon and Houston lawyer John WorldPeace will be on the March ballot.

UK: AEP hires Enron Nordic power trading team.

Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

LONDON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - U.S. utility American Electric Power said on Tuesday it had hired 35 former employees from stricken energy company Enron's Nordic power trading unit and taken over the company's offices in Norway and Sweden. 
The team, headed by Thor Lien, is a major player in the Nordic power market, the most established electricity trading market in Europe.
""The Nordic region is a mature energy market, but one where - to date - AEP has not participated,"" said Hank Jones, head of AEP's wholesale trading business in Europe, in a statement. 
Jones said hiring the Enron team would give AEP trading expertise in Scandinavia and also the capacity to trade power between Denmark and Germany, Europe's largest power market where AEP is one of the biggest traders. 
In December, Ohio-based AEP hired 22 employees from Enron's international coal team in London. 
Enron's European energy trading business went into administration in November after a financial crisis at its American parent company spiralled out of control. 
AEP has also recently bought two power stations in Britain with a capacity of 4,000 megawatts.

Germany's WestLB Sues Enron Units Over Letter Of Credit
By Colleen DeBaise

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
(This report was originally published Monday.) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- German bank Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (G.WLG) accused two Enron Corp. (ENE) units of misrepresenting their financial condition to obtain a $23.7 million letter of credit from the bank.
WestLB claims in a lawsuit filed Monday in Manhattan federal court that the units, National Energy Production Corp. and Nepco Power Procurement Co., failed to disclose that they had no bank accounts, didn't control their own funds, and had no financial existence apart from Enron. 
The bank also contends that the units were engaged in ""various secret, fraudulent and out of the ordinary course financial transactions"" that eventually made them and their parent company insolvent. 
A representative for Nepco and Nepco Power wasn't immediately for comment. 
The bank says it issued the letter of credit in August to the owner of a power plant project that Nepco, of Bothell, Wash., and Nepco Power, of Houston, were hired to build in Mississippi. 
The bank says the plant's owner, TPS McAdams, provided funds to the Enron units to pay for certain costs of the project, such as subcontractors' and suppliers' fees. But instead of using the funds for those purposes, Nepco and Nepco immediately transferred the money to their parent company, which filed for bankruptcy last month. 
Nepco and Nepco defaulted on their obligations to the project, causing TPS McAdams to draw down nearly $20 million under the letter of credit. 
WestLB says it wouldn't have issued the letter of credit if it had known about the units' and Enron's improper transactions. 
The bank's suit charges fraud and breach of contract and seeks the return of the funds plus other unspecified relief. 
Enron collapsed last year amid revelations of questionable accounting practices. The energy company's bankruptcy case is the largest in corporate history.

El Paso,Tractebel,Singapore Power Eye SK-Enron Stk-Report

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

SEOUL -(Dow Jones)- U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) received expression of interests from five or six energy companies for the sale of its 50% stake in its Korean joint venture SK-Enron Co., the Korea Energy News reported last month. 
The local energy weekly reported that El Paso Corp. (EP), Tractebel S.A. (B.TRB), and Singapore Power Ltd. are among the companies which have expressed interest.
Enron is considering international energy majors as the new partner in SK-Enron and plans to complete the sales during the first half of 2002, the Korea Energy said. 
An Enron official in SK-Enron said that the company is in the process of selling its stake but declined to provide further details. 
Enron is seeking to sell its entire SK-Enron stake in its bid to overcome its financial crisis. 
Meanwhile, its South Korean partner SK Corp. (Q.SKP) has said previously that it will consider buying Enron's 50% stake in the joint venture. 
However, SK Corp. hasn't received an offer from Enron to buy the stake yet, a company spokesman said. 
SK-Enron is an energy holding company with stakes in 11 affiliates, including a 46% stake in the liquefied petroleum gas provider SK Gas Co. (Q.SKX). 
SK-Enron was formed in 1999. The company holds about 25% of South Korea's natural gas market and about 50% of the LPG market, the company said.

CNOOC sets sights on overseas prize Chairman confirms talks may seal US$600m deal, with analysts tipping bankrupt Enron as probable seller

CNOOC chairman Wei Liucheng feels China's largest offshore oil and gas producer is close to sealing a deal for an overseas oilfield. 
An industry source said embattled United States energy trading group Enron was the probable seller.
The location of the field is not known, but the acquisition is expected to bolster CNOOC's daily output significantly. 
""[The acquisition] is very likely to be in the very near future,"" Mr Wei told state-run China Central Television, according to a Reuters' report. 
""If, after a week's time, you suddenly hear that CNOOC had spent US$600 million to acquire a large oilfield overseas, I hope you will not be surprised,"" he said. 
Analysts said they were told late last year CNOOC had set a production target of 110 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) for this year, but this would be raised to 125 million boe if a planned acquisition materialised. Last year's production was about 95 million boe. 
CNOOC chief financial officer Mark Qiu Zilei would not confirm the targets, saying there had been a lot of speculation about the company recently and it would soon clarify this year's strategy. He would not comment on speculation of an oilfield purchase from Enron. 
On December 21, Enron filed the largest bankruptcy in United States' history. 
The highly leveraged Houston-based energy trader was believed to have used special-purpose entities in transactions to reduce liabilities on its balance sheet in order to maintain its good credit rating and avoid calls for early debt repayments. 
Mr Qiu indicated that CNOOC's primary focus was on oil and gas development in offshore China, but it might take advantage of attractive investment opportunities overseas. 
""Overseas exploration is not our core strategy, but we are not against attractive investment opportunities that make sense to our shareholders,"" he said. 
He said the difficult economic and industry environment, which caused oil prices to drop sharply in recent months, created acquisition opportunities. 
Some highly leveraged companies had been forced to shed assets to survive. 
Meanwhile, CNOOC parent China National Offshore Oil Corp is to invest about three billion yuan (HK$2.8 billion) to expand production capacity at a fertiliser plant in Hainan province that it acquired last year from the Government. 
Upon completion, expected late next year, the plant will have an annual urea production capacity of more than 1.2 million tonnes, 450,000 tonnes of synthetic ammonia and 600,000 tonnes of methanol, making it China's largest fertiliser facility. 
It is one of three major downstream projects aimed at making it an integrated oil giant. 
Yesterday, CNOOC's share price rose 5.33 per cent, to HK$7.90, as oil prices rose to their highest levels since mid-October.

VIEWPOINTS
Bush Escapes Deserved Heat In Enron Case

ALL EDITIONS

(Copyright Newsday Inc., 2002)

NEXT TO THE girlish schemes of Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, the Whitewater land deals, the irregularities at the White House travel office or the White House fund-raising coffees, the collapse of Enron Corp. was far more costly to its legion of victims and to the cause of corporate transparency. 
And if you add on the fact of the Bush family's intimate connections to Enron, the company's vast contributions to Bush campaigns, the ubiquitous Texas connections that characterized Enron's influence, the coziness of Enron to Texas Republican Sen. Phil Gramm and his wife, Wendy, you need a crow bar to separate Enron's allegiance to both Bush administrations.
Whatever the brilliant Wendy Gramm saw going on at Enron, where she served on the board's audit committee, did not provoke suspicions that she was standing on a sinking ship. 
Look no further than George W. Bush's affectionate nickname for Enron's disgraced former chairman, Kenneth L. Lay. It was ""Kenny Boy."" The seamless pipeline into the Bush White House that Enron enjoyed was the envy of every lobbyist and influence peddler in Washington. Lay was a sleepover at the White House during the first Bush administration. 
That said, George W. Bush is not the first president to be embarrassed by his contributors or suffer exposure of an under-the- blankets relationship with a rogue corporation. Happens all the time. But it rarely happens on such a scale. Only in the Bush-can-do- no- wrong atmosphere of current Washington does such a scandal resist the sort of smelly exposure and inquiry that accompanied every misjudgment of the eight years of Bill Clinton. It's as if Bush has been inoculated with an immunity no known virus can invade. 
If only in terms of the number of blameless employees who were robbed blind of their 401(k) balances, which are now worth loose change, the Enron bankruptcy has a breadth and depth of shame that in normal times would make last summer's obsession with Gary Condit or any of the Clinton ""scandals"" seem like puerile nonsense. 
And, belatedly, we learned that Arthur Andersen, Enron's supposedly unforgiving, whistle-blowing auditor, had privately warned the Enron audit committee of ""possible illegal acts within the company."" Why, then, does George W. Bush float above this stench like a fragrant blossom? 
This situation is only partly explained by the legitimate distractions of the war on terrorism. I suspect it has more to do with generic differences in the degree of bloodlust for scandal practiced by Republicans and Democrats. Democrats have for 50 years been accused of being ""soft"" - on communism, on crime, on military spending. This may be because of their natural inclination to be sympathetic to human weaknesses, a liberal distaste for unfairness, a healthy suspicion of Pentagon profligacy and their instinct to take in the curs that some of us call underdogs. 
Anyway, if Enron had been an institution of Democratic influence and power, we can only imagine the savagery with which right-wing zealots would be now tearing at its flesh, chomping on its bones and implying even more criminality and mendacity than may have occurred at an ambitious corporation that naively thought it had rigged success and canceled all risk.

SMARTMONEY.COM: Ask SmartMoney: Worthless Or Worth Less?

(This report was first published late Monday.)

QUESTION: How do I go about having a stock declared worthless?
- Anonymous 
ANSWER: If you're one of the unfortunate folk who still hold shares of bankrupt companies like Enron (ENE) or Polaroid (PRDCQ), then you're probably looking forward to taking a worthless-stock write-off on your 2001 tax return. And with good reason: If you can prove that your investment is worthless, the IRS allows you to take a capital loss on Schedule D. It treats the worthless stock as a sale for zero dollars on the last trading day of the year, regardless of when the ""worthlessness"" actually occurred - which could be important in determining whether you have a long- or short-term capital loss. Plus, you don't have to fork over the brokerage fee for unloading the worthless shares. The trick is that you must take the write-off in the same tax year that the stock completely loses its value. 
But while you might think the stock of a company that has declared bankruptcy is worthless, the IRS might not agree. First, and most obvious, a 68-cent stock like Enron's, while far off its highs, isn't worthless at all. In fact, shares have more than doubled since touching a low of 26 cents on Nov. 30. Millions of shares still change hands each day on the New York Stock Exchange. A truly worthless stock, by contrast, must have no economic value. To prove that's the case with your stock, you could obtain a letter from a broker saying that he or she is unable to find a buyer for the stock, says Ron Hegt, a CPA and partner at Hays & Co. in New York City. A short letter, even just a sentence or paragraph long, is usually sufficient. You won't have to submit it with your tax return, adds Hegt, but you should have this letter in case of an audit. 
Second, the IRS requires that the company in question must have ceased operations. But keep in mind that bankruptcy proceedings can take several years, and companies sometimes rise from the ashes, says Art Ford, a CPA and certified financial planner at Sullivan Bille in Tewksbury, Mass. Just because your company has filed for bankruptcy doesn't mean that it has actually stopped operating - so it may be too soon to declare its stock worthless. And when your company isn't as big as Enron, it might be difficult to follow its bankruptcy proceedings closely. One resource is the Capital Changes Reporter, published by the Commerce Clearing House. This publication gives monthly updates on name changes, dividend payments, incorporations and stock worthlessness. Your broker or local library should have a copy. 
If you can't prove that your shares are worthless, but are eager to get your deduction this year, then you could simply sell them and take the capital loss. Remember, you can deduct up to $3,000 in net losses per year, and anything beyond that can be carried over to offset gains in future tax years. 
But if you're determined to take the full deduction on your worthless stock, then keep in mind that you have seven years to amend your tax return. So if your stock became worthless in 2001, you've got until April 2009 to prove it and file that amended tax return.

Glencore rules itself out of bidding for Enron's London metals trading arm

01/08/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

LONDON (AFX) - Swiss-based Glencore International AG, the giant privately owned metals and mining group, has ruled itself out of the bidding for the London metal trading arm of collapsed US energy group Enron Corp. 
""We have not submitted a bid for the business,"" said a Glencore spokeswoman.
Glencore has been named as a front runner for the London Metal Exchange (LME) trading operation, Enron Metal Ltd, in recent newspaper reports. 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers, administrators to the collapsed US energy group Enron, are expected this week to unveil the sale of Enron Metal, the largest firm on the LME. 
When asked about the timing of any announcement a PWC spokesman declined to comment. The deal will be the third major disposal to be agreed in the UK since Enron's European operations went into administration at the end of November. 
As well as Glencore, newspapers have named other industry players San Diego based Sempra Energy and BP PLC as potential bidders. 
Among banks, the press have mentioned Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Citigroup Inc and American International Group Inc as well as UBS and HSBC Holdings PLC. 
But a source close to the deal said HSBC was also ""not a credible runner"". 
Enron Metal became a ring dealing member of the LME in May 2000 with the 300 mln stg acquisition of metals trader MG which employed 330 staff in 14 countries at the time of the takeover. 
The deal formed part of Enron's move into trading products outside its core energy activities. 
But Enron Metal, which has operated independently of Enron on the LME since its parent company filed for bankruptcy protection, is now expected to fetch less than its purchase price. 
The deal is not expected to include Enron's international metals warehousing side, which was up for sale before Enron's collapse and will be sold separately. 
Last month PWC agreed the 96 mln stg sale of Enron Direct, which supplies gas and power to 160,000 small UK businesses, to Centrica. 
Enron's Europe-based international coal trading operations are also understood to have been sold to US energy group AEP for some 35 mln usd. 
Enron's remaining UK assets include Wessex Water, the south-west England water supplier, and a 42 pct stake in Teeside Power.

Consulting Alert: Enron Debacle Could Force Andersen to Divest Consulting Practice

01/08/2002
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2002, Business Wire)

ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 8, 2002-- 

Could push firm into arms of merger partner
Andersen's role in the implosion of Enron Corp. could spiral toward a divestiture of its $1.71 billion consulting operation, once the Enron disaster is played out in court, according to Consulting Alert (http://www.straffordpub.com/products/can/index.html). 
In its latest edition, Consulting Alert noted that even before the Enron collapse, Andersen had entertained early merger talks with other Big Five accounting/consulting firms over the last two years, and that KPMG and Ernst & Young appear to match up best with its business strategy and clients. 
However, both those two firms entered into non-compete agreements when they spun off their own consulting practices, which would make it all but certain that Andersen's consulting business would have to be divested before a merger could go through. 
Legal claims against Andersen over its audit of Enron could, if proven, cost Andersen literally billions of dollars in damages, possibly crippling its ability to remain independent, according to Consulting Alert(http://www.straffordpub.com/products/can/index.html).

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

"RE: Re-start/Integration Planning","I will be back in the office on Thursday. I can be reached on my cell phone if you need me. 713-858-1534. Santa pulled his back out while taking a ping-pong table off the sleigh!
 
I have looked at the list of customers and resorted by physical business for Texas. That list is attached. Please look through those other customers NOT listed in the top 50 for Texas and mak sure the list is OK. I also think we should look at ADDING customers we think will replace or at least be in addition to those top 50.
 
I would like to see the following added:
 
Texas Independent Energy
City of Garland
Southern Union
CPS - City of San Antonio
TECO
Saxet Petroleum
ExxonMobil
Comstock Resources
Lonestar Pipeline
Austin Energy - City of Austin
LCRA
 
We should look at our phone list and add those contacts to our list so to identify who we would like to attend the meeting. We also should have email addresses for most of these people so it would cut down on some time if we could also email the new contract to the customer for review as well.
 
JD and Morris, please look at this list and add customers as needed. Our business really depends on who we were begining to do business with and for our area, the rankings may need to change to reflect that difference. The column reflecting amount owed customer could be filled in from my spreadsheet I started mid-December. I know we are trying to start fresh but outstanding dollars owed customers will be an issue that will need to be addressed and we should know in the ballpark who and how much we owe. See if we can populate that column as well.
 
Call me if you have any questions or concerns,

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster

+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side   
+       Customers               Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) 
                                Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) 
                                Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) 
+       Action Plan             Phase  1 Customers 
                                Phase  2 Customers 
                                Phase  3 Customers 
+       Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) 
+       Customer visit schedule 

Product Side 
+       List of Products        Phase 1 - First Week 
                                Phase 2 - First Month 
                                Phase 3 - First Quarter

Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch
2001-10-26 15:00 (New York)

Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch Neg

Fitch-NY-October 26, 2001: Fitch has placed the ratings of
Marlin Water Trust II's (Marlin II's) approximately $915 million
senior secured notes due 2003, and Osprey Trust's (Osprey's)
approximately $2.4 billion senior secured notes due 2003 on
Rating Watch Negative. The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notes
are currently rated `BBB'. This rating action follows the
placing of Enron Corp.'s ratings on Rating Watch Negative by
Fitch.

The rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfund
account (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron
in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The
overfund account is invested in Enron debt securities (rated
'BBB+', Rating Watch Negative), with payments used to service
interest to noteholders. Payment of principal ultimately relies
on Enron's obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible
preferred securities. Fitch currently rates Enron's preferred
securities 'BBB-', Rating Watch Negative. In addition, the
transaction also benefits from rights under a $125 million loan
to Azurix Europe Limited, rated `BBB+' by Fitch.

Similarly, the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on the
support from the assets in the share trust used to support
interest payments and an equity commitment from Enron to
remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund
principal payments. The mandatorily convertible preferred stock
has been issued and is being held in the share trust. The assets
in the share trust supporting interest payments include Enron
unsecured obligations (the overfund account) as well as
quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible
preferred stock.

While various sources of repayment exist, such as sale or
liquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering, in
each case primary credit support is derived from the Enron
obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock
if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been
deposited with the trustee the 120-day prior to the maturity
date, which is one of the Note Trigger Events. In the event that
the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount
required to redeem the senior notes, Enron is required to
deliver additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver
on this obligation, subject to certain standstill periods, then
the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of
Enron, representing a general unsecured claim. Additional Note
Trigger Events include a downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured
debt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies
in conjunction with specified declines in Enron's closing stock
price over three consecutive trading days, as well as customary
events of default under the notes. It is important to note that
Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

Fitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction
with the ratings of Enron, Corp. and will update investors as
appropriate.


Enron's Debt Falls As Company Draws Down On Bank Loans

10/26/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) bond and bank debt was quoted lower early Friday following the Houston energy giant's decision Thursday to draw down about $3 billion on its bank loan facilities. 
Late Thursday, Enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community. Specifically, the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $1 billion.
Enron's 6.4% bonds which come due in July 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar, down from around 82 cents on Thursday. 
Trading activity in investment-grade bank debt like that of Enron's isn't as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment-grade ratings. But fixed-income sources noted some offers Friday for Enron's bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar, still well-above distressed levels. They add that banks may want to try to sell Enron's bank debt, which is now funded following the drawdown, but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago. 
That was well before Enron ran into its current market turmoil. Last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The company has said that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with Andrew S. Fastow, its former chief financial officer who was replaced on Wednesday. 
Moody's Investors Service rates Enron's senior unsecured debt at Baa1, though it's on review for a possible downgrade. Fitch Inc. and Standard & Poor's both rate the debt triple-B-plus. Fitch also has Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, while S&P changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. 
Enron's stock was trading at around $15.87, down 48 cents at around 12.20 p.m. EDT. 
Among the Enron bank debt that comes due in May 2002 is a $1.75 billion 364-day commercial paper backstop facility. The company also has a $1.25 billion revolving facility that's due in April 2005, according to Loan Pricing Corp. in New York. 
One distressed debt investor said some of the bank debt comes with a low coupon of around 55 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate. 
Banks, the investor said, ""are funding it and not getting paid for the risk at Libor plus 55, even though it comes due in May '02,"" the investor said. 
Another fixed-income official said that trading desks may start to kick the tires on Enron's bank debt, given the run of fallen angels, or investment-grade companies that have been downgraded to below investment-grade status, within the last year. Among such companies are Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) and Xerox Corp. (XRX) 
""As soon as banks have a piece of paper they never expected to be funded, it really changes their perception and some just want to get this stuff off their books,"" this person said. 
Some banks, though, may not be active seller of Enron's debt given that banks' business with big investment-grade companies is relationship-driven. 
""Banks are not very quick to pull out of a relationship like that,"" the fixed income official said.

Enron Sues Microsoft Over Failed Broadband Services Deal
By Michael Rieke
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/26/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- In a July conference call with analysts when Jeff Skilling was still chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE), he threw out a ray of hope for his company's foundering broadband business. 
Enron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide bandwidth for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, Skilling said. Enron would give more details on the deal later.
After three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its silence by suing Microsoft. 
In a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, Enron claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal. 
The agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering of high-speed Internet service, according to the lawsuit. 
Microsoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the deal, according to the lawsuit. 
Microsoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal, so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal, the lawsuit said. 

Microsoft sent Enron a letter dated Oct. 23 saying that if Enron didn't provide an operational broadband system by Oct. 25, Enron would have breached the contract, the lawsuit said. Microsoft then would be entitled to recover damages. 
The suit also said Microsoft failed to provide monthly subscriber growth forecast required by the deal. 
In a third breach of the contract, the suit claimed, Microsoft made public announcements about the subject of the agreement without getting Enron's prior approval. 
An Enron official told Dow Jones Newswires that Microsoft had issued a press release Oct. 15 about the service but that Enron wasn't mentioned in the release. 
A Microsoft news release dated Oct. 15 announced what the company calls MSN 7, a new version of the MSN network which includes high-speed, or broadband, access to the Web. The service was to be available on Oct. 25. 
The Microsoft release said MSN 7 would deliver ""state-of-the-art"" video and audio through ""dramatically improved"" broadband technology. The new service would extend MSN broadband service ""to more than 29 million households in 45 markets."" 
By the end of the first quarter of 2002, the Microsoft release said, the MSN broadband service would be available to more than 90% of U.S. households capable of using high-speed digital subscriber line access. 
The Enron lawsuit asked that Microsoft be declared in breach of contract. It also asked that Enron be allowed to recover unspecified damages as well as costs stemming from the lawsuit. 
Neither Enron nor Microsoft have responded to requests for comment on the lawsuit. 
The Microsoft deal is the second failed broadband agreement. In July 2000, Enron and Blockbuster Video, a unit of Viacom Inc. (VIA), announced a deal to deliver movies over the Internet. 
That deal fell apart in March of this year when Blockbuster said Enron's fiber-optic network couldn't deliver the service on a dependable basis. Enron countered that Blockbuster couldn't deliver the quality and quantity of movies needed for a successful video-on-demand service.

ENRON UNIT TAKES HEAT POWER GROUP SAYS ENERGY FIRM FAILED BOND REQUIREMENTS
Jeffrey Krasner, Globe Staff

10/26/2001
The Boston Globe
THIRD
C.1
(Copyright 2001)

The retail sales subsidiary of Houston energy giant Enron Corp. faced expulsion last week from the New England group representing power generators, marketers and distributors. The sales unit had failed to meet bonding requirements intended to protect market participants and the group itself from unpaid bills. 
ISO New England, which operates the power grid throughout the six New England states, urged Nepool, the power industry group, to ""initiate termination proceedings"" for Enron Energy Services Inc., according to a letter obtained by the Globe.
An Enron spokeswoman yesterday said the company had satisfied Nepool's requirements, and blamed the threatening letter on a series of administrative oversights, including the failure of ISO New England to warn Enron of previous instances when the bond fell below required levels. 
""It was an administrative snafu,"" said Peggy Mahoney, a spokeswoman for Enron. ""It's fixed. It's no big deal. We didn't get the paperwork in [on time] because it got sent to the wrong desk. It was taken care of on Friday."" 
According to the letter, a Nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous 12 months. ""Having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently,"" said Ellen Foley, an ISO New England spokeswoman. In the letter, ISO's chief financial officer, Edward McKenna, said his organization ""has been in contact with Enron Energy Services through multiple telephone communications, and to date the financial assurance has not been cured."" 
But Mahoney said Enron never received written notification of its previous ""financial assurance"" defaults, which were corrected almost immediately. Therefore, she said, the company was unaware that the current default was the third, which begins the expulsion proceeding. In addition, she said, the current default notice was sent to the wrong person, creating the delay that resulted in the letter. ""We're working with ISO New England to figure that out,"" she said. 
The recommended termination is an embarrassment to Enron because the firm's director of state government affairs, Daniel W. Allegretti, is the chairman of Nepool's Participant Committee, which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization. 
""This is not that unusual within the pool,"" said Allegretti. ""I frequently receive notices of technical defaults."" As far as posting the new bond to correct the situation, he said, ""We were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork."" 
The incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Enron. The parent in Houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firm's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with Enron. The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing those transactions, the company said Monday. Enron placed Fastow on leave Tuesday and installed a new CFO. 
Enron's stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the company's financial strength. The company reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by Fastow, according to The Wall Street Journal. Enron lost $618 million in the third quarter. 
Yesterday, Enron's shares closed at $16.35, down 6 cents, on volume of 39.1 million shares.

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS: Enron's explanations fail to quell critics' concerns 
Financial Times; Oct 26, 2001
By JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTY

Enron has put up a page on its website of ""frequently asked questions"" in response to a barrage of analysts' enquiries following last week's controversial results announcement. 
Unfortunately, the US energy group's critics have not been satisfied with the answers. Nor has Wednesday's decision to replace Andrew Fastow, its chief financial officer, quelled all investors' concerns about its highly complex financial affairs. 
However, analysts are pleased that Kenneth Lay, chief executive officer, is distancing the group from Mr Fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle ""partnerships"". ""It is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move,"" says Ronald Barone of UBS Warburg. ""It's not the end of it."" 
The shares, which have tumbled since last week's results, ended a shade lower yesterday, off 0.37 per cent at Dollars 16.35. But analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the 52-week high of Dollars 84.87 until the group improves its transparency. 
One of the frequently asked questions following Enron's results announcement on October 16 concerned ""a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 840m) reduction in shareholders' equity"". The Dollars 1.2bn was not explained in the news release on the results, but mentioned in passing by Mr Lay in a follow-up conference call. Many analysts confused it with a Dollars 1.01bn charge in the earnings report. 
It has since been called a ""loss"" and a ""write-off"" and Enron's staff have struggled to explain it in plain language. 
Enron's official position now is that the reduction in shareholders' equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which LJM, a private equity fund formed by Mr Fastow, was an investor. When the decision was made to terminate these vehicles, Enron ""recorded a Dollars 1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables. These adjustments were the result of Enron's termination of obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods"". 
The confusion over the Dollars 1.2bn has further undermined the credibility of Enron, which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Analysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the group's debt ratio, which might hurt its debt rating. 
Mr Lay held an analysts' meeting to counter charges that Enron was not transparent. But this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts. ""I find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions,"" said Goldman Sachs' David Fleischer. 
Other analysts are also concerned about potential further write-offs. Salomon Smith Barney's Raymond Niles points to Enron's investments in its Dabhol Indian power plant, its South American investments, and its remaining telecoms assets. Most importantly, he says, they may include several of Enron's other off-balance-sheet vehicles. 
""Frankly, we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem with them,"" Mr Niles says. Other US energy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival. El Paso said it was facing ""a lot of questions on its accounting practices"".

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update3)

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update3)

     (Adds Egan-Jones lowering credit rating in 12th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares
fell after the company failed to reassure investors its bond
rating wouldn't be lowered and tapped a $3 billion credit line
because it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets.

     Enron's stock has fallen 52 percent in the past 10 days after
investors questioned the company's transactions with affiliated
companies run by its former chief financial officer. The stock
fell 45 cents to $15.90 in early afternoon trading today.

     ``People are questioning the credibility of management,''
said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion of fixed income
assets at Fifth Third Bancorp. ``It looks like the guy who was
supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was
running partnerships for the benefit of himself.''

     Enron is shut out of commercial paper markets, where short-
term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. The company will
use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it
has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

      The company's 6 3/4 percent bonds which mature in 2009
declined 1 1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an
offer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating
of ``BBB+,'' yield 9.53 percent.

     Enron's shares have dropped as investors grew concerned that
the company's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in
third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good
credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding
collateral and to settle transactions.


                         Dilution Concerns

     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies
with ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for
seven years.

     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value
of Enron investors' stock.

     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron
assets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep debt related to them off its books. The
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets.

     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money
comes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt.

     One way would be issuing common shares in exchange for Enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would
thin out the holding of every other investor.

     Of the two main bond rating companies, Moody's Investors
Service has the company on watch for possible downgrade, and
Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to
negative. Egan-Jones Rating Co. today lowered its rating on
Enron's debt to BB+, one notch below investment grade, from BBB-.

                         Other Liabilities

     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amounts
to at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.

     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on
Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct
losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

Weiss & Yourman Law Office Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against Enron Corp.

10/26/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--A class action lawsuit against Enron Corp. (""Enron"" or the ""Company"")(NYSE:ENE) and certain of its officers and directors was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, on behalf of purchasers of Enron securities. If you purchased Enron securities between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, please read this notice. 
The complaint charges the defendants with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose material adverse information and misrepresented the truth about the Company and caused plaintiff and other members of the Class to purchase Enron common stock at artificially inflated prices.
This action seeks to recover damages on behalf of defrauded investors who purchased Enron securities. Plaintiff is represented by Weiss & Yourman, a law firm possessing significant experience and expertise in prosecuting class actions on behalf of defrauded shareholders in federal and state courts throughout the United States. Weiss & Yourman has been appointed by numerous courts to serve as lead counsel in class action lawsuits and in that capacity has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of investors. 
If you purchased Enron securities between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, you may move the Court no later than December 21, 2001, to serve as a lead plaintiff of the class. In order to serve as a lead plaintiff, you must meet certain legal requirements. A lead plaintiff is a representative party that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Under certain circumstances, one or more class members may together serve as ""lead plaintiff."" Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. You may retain Weiss & Yourman or other counsel of your choice to serve as your counsel in this action.

Please work with Tom and the trading group to arrange an after work get together for the Texas team (admin and support included).  We should have it at a place where we can get a semi-private room serving food and cocktails. The idea is to have a holiday party to get to know each other.  The origination team will also be signing holiday cards to send out to our customers, so we need to do it sooner (late Nov or early Dec), so the cards the be delivered.  Gary Bryan can give you some ideas.
 
Regards,
Brian

Did we ever decide about our Xmas card signing? Were we going to do it at your home with spouses or w/o spouses after work with cocktails? I would like to get to know the guys on the Texas desk and after work one afternoon might be fun. Can we try for a Tuesday or Thursday? The reason I mention this is that I received a Xmas card from a customer today. We should go ahead and order cards and get a list together ASAP. The date will be fast upon us. 
 
Also, I would like to order something like a Greenberg turkey for several of my better customers. Do you have a problem with that this year? If you like I could include several of your key customers as well.
 
I also requested Michael get Morris a RIM as well as a phone.
 
In case we miss each other Tuesday, I will be meeting with the VP of TotalFinaElf regarding supplying gas under the Frontera transaction, talking about several of their chemical plants in addition to discuss trading with them daily. After lunch I will be meeting with BP Amoco to talk about several plant deliveries as well as look at daily trading with them. (Morris was unable to make either of these meeting but when he gets onboard I will pass of the supply part of these accounts to him.
 
I can be reached on my cell phone and maybe my RIM!

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Anne

I left the following in your office this morning:

1) Correspondence and Gregg Modeling inovice totalling $107,635.  We feel that this is an issue that AEP needs to settle directly with Gregg Engineering.

2) D.L. Peterson Trust invoice totalling $22,152 for a truck.   AEP has paid the invoice dated 5/24/01 and asked us for reimbursement.  However we see this as a non-emergency purchase right before close that was not properly authorized by Brian.  

Also attached is an updated Inventory and Working Capital Calculation Statement.  I have updated based on the change in the prime rate yesterday.

Call me at 3-5346 if you need anything else.

He is calling them as we speak and is going to set up the meeting for Tuesday at 10:00 and he will request that CC Pace supply us with a list of written questions.  Either way we should continue with the meeting.

"Paine Webber Questions","Tom, I believe you are correct regarding the voice mail question you left me.  Anything you trade on that might be in a Schwabb account etc will more than likely need to be rolled over to Paine Webber.  Mutual Funds will probably not be an issue.  Like I said, I don't have too much information on that right now however I just wanted to give you guys a heads up that we will have to eventually make those changes.

Thanks, Tony

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Enron North America Corp. and  Enron Net Works LLC are circulating this Questionnaire to their directors and officers to develop and verify information that will be used in connection with the proposed sale of all the business of wholesale trading of natural gas and electricity with customers in North America. In a nutshell, we need to disclose any transactions between you and Enron Corp., Enron North America Corp. or Enron Net Works relating to the trading business since September 30, 1999.

We expect to be in position to sign the purchase documents upon completion of the auction scheduled for Thursday, January 10, 2002.  Unfortunately, that means we need your responses to the questionnaire as soon as possible, and in no event later than 4:00 p.m. of January 10, 2002.

Enron CFO's Partnership Had Millions in Profit
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

A limited partnership organized by Enron Corp.'s chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it did with Enron, according to an internal partnership document. 
The partnership, in some instances, benefited from renegotiating the terms of existing deals with the Houston energy company in ways that improved the partnership's financial positions or reduced its risk of losses.
Mr. Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in December 1999 principally to do business with Enron. 
The profits from the deals were disclosed in a financial report to investors in the partnership, LJM2 Co-Investment LP, that was signed by Mr. Fastow as the general partner and dated April 30. In one case, the report indicates the partnership was able to improve profits by terminating a transaction early. 
The LJM2 arrangement has become controversial for Enron, as shareholders and analysts have raised questions about whether it posed a conflict by putting the company's chief financial officer, who has a fiduciary duty to Enron shareholders, in a position of reaping financial rewards for representing LJM2 investors in business deals with Enron. Investors in LJM2 include Wachovia Corp., General Electric Co.'s General Electric Capital Corp. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston. 
Attention has focused on Mr. Fastow's partnership activities at a tumultuous time for Enron, which over the past decade grew enormously by becoming the nation's biggest energy-trading company. 
This year, though, it has been hit by a string of troubles, from soured business initiatives to executive departures. On Tuesday, Enron announced a $618 million third-quarter loss, because of a $1.01 billion write-off on investments in broadband telecommunications, retail energy services and Azurix Corp., a water company. A small chunk of that write-off, about $35 million, was attributed to ending certain LJM2-related transactions. That termination also produced a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity as the company decided to repurchase 55 million shares that had been part of LJM2 deals. 
At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down 9.9%, or $3.20, to $29 a share. Within the past year, the stock had topped $80 a share. 
Enron officials didn't have any comment about the LJM2 partnership document. Enron has consistently said its dealings with LJM2 have been proper. They said the LJM2 deals, like ones done with other parties, were aimed at helping hedge against fluctuating market values of its assets and adding sources of capital. 
Mr. Fastow has declined several requests for an interview about LJM2. In late July, he formally severed his ties with LJM2, as a result of what Enron officials said was growing unease by Wall Street analysts and major shareholders. Mr. Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments. 
Michael Kopper, a former Enron executive who an Enron spokesman said is now helping to operate LJM2, declined to comment. He also wouldn't describe his relation to LJM2. 
In his April 30 report, Mr. Fastow said the partnership, which raised $394 million, had invested in several Enron-related deals involving power plants and other assets as well as company stock. The document said LJM2 sought a 29% internal rate of return. That was down from a 48% targeted rate of return at the end of 2000, which the document said was due in part to a decline in the value of LJM2's investment in New Power Co., an Enron-related energy retailer. In some transactions, LJM2 did much better than the 29% target, though this sometimes involved renegotiating individual deals. 
In September 2000, the partnership invested $30 million in ""Raptor III,"" which involved writing put options committing LJM2 to buy Enron stock at a set price for six months. Four months into this deal, LJM2 approached Enron to settle the investment early, ""causing LJM2 to receive its $30 million capital invested plus $10.5 million in profit,"" the report said. The renegotiation was before a decline in Enron's stock price, which could have forced LJM2 to buy Enron shares at a loss of as much as $8 each, the document indicated.

Enron CFO Profited From Partnerships With Company, WSJ Reports
2001-10-19 01:00 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow realized profits through a limited
partnership that did business with Enron, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an internal partnership document.

     LJM2 Co-Investment LP, of which Fastow is a general partner,
made millions of dollars on transactions with Enron, the paper
said. Fastow and possibly a handful of partnership associates made
$7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in
capital increases on an investment of about $3 million in the
partnership, the paper said.

     Enron shareholder Fred Greenberg filed a lawsuit yesterday,
alleging that Enron's board cost the company at least $35 million
by allowing Fastow to manage partnerships that bought Enron
assets. Enron reported $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from
failed investments.

1. Bayer Fighting the Bears?
One beneficiary of the anthrax scare has been Bayer AG (BAYZY:OTC BB ADR - news - commentary) , the German chemical maker, which has seen its share price gain 10.4% since the terrorist attacks. But investors bidding up the stock might be getting ahead of themselves. 
Bayer makes Cipro, a leading treatment for anthrax. But while the demand for Cipro is high, sales from the drug are only a small portion of the company's overall revenue, which totaled 30.9 billion euros last year (and, according to analysts, will increase even more this year, due to its acquisition of Aventis CropScience, a crop protection and production company). To put the demand for Cipro in context, J.P. Morgan expects U.S. sales of the drug to be approximately 1.2 billion euros for 2001. 
Even emergency purchases of Cipro probably won't add that much to Bayer's overall revenues. The president has asked for $643 million for antibiotics to combat bioterrorist attacks. While it's possible that sum will be increased, not all the money would be spent on Cipro. 
Besides, it's not even clear that Bayer will remain the only producer of Cipro. Though the company holds the patent for the drug, there's some pressure in Congress for the government to purchase a generic version from other manufacturers. 
On another front, Bayer is currently battling a class-action lawsuit related to an anti-cholesterol drug implicated in a number of deaths. It was forced to withdraw the drug from the market. 
Bayer may offer protection against anthrax, but that doesn't mean it's a refuge for investors. 
2. Losses at Twice the Price
You know things are bad for a company when its losses per share are double the price of the shares themselves. That's the case for i2 Technologies (ITWO:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , the supply-chain software maker. After market close on Tuesday, the company posted losses under generally accepted accounting principles that amounted to $5.5 billion, or $13.25 per share, for the latest quarter, including all charges. 
In other words, i2's losses were more than twice the value of its share price, which closed at $5.69 before the announcement. 
Much of the huge writedown reflects amortized goodwill from the purchase of Aspect Development in March 2000. 
To be fair, investors in companies that have made big acquisitions like i2 typically focus on pro forma earnings, which exclude charges and extraordinary items. By that measure, i2's losses didn't look quite so bad: The company met analysts' consensus expectations with a loss of $55.3 million, or 13 cents per share. 
Still, investors met i2's earnings with disapproval, knocking the stock down 25% the day after they were reported. 
3. Microsoft's Bag of Tricks
In times like these, there's comfort in knowing business goes on as usual at many U.S. companies. Just like the old days, Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq - news - commentary) is in the hot seat for its sharklike behavior toward a competitor. 
It stands accused of sending 3,000 fake cereal boxes emblazoned with the words ""Microsoft Server Crunch"" to customers of rival server software maker Novell. The boxes, according to Novell, contained ""a number of false and misleading statements"" intended as putdowns of Novell products. 
Among the attempted insults were some not-so-clever plays on packaged food. For example, in a reference to Novell's flagship software product, a line on the Microsoft boxes read: ""What's the expiration date on that NetWare platform?"" (A round of applause, please, for those gut-splittingly funny engineers.) 
The boxes also said Novell is shifting its focus from software to consulting services, which Novell says isn't true. 
Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the cereal boxes were primarily intended to advertise Microsoft services, not to slight Novell. ""It was all in the theme of a mock cereal box,"" he said. ""It was a modest campaign."" 
In response to Novell's complaints, he says Microsoft sent out a letter in September to recipients of the boxes to clarify some of its statements, and it's just agreed to send another letter to appease the company. For the record, Novell said it's not calling off its lawsuit for unspecified money damages. 
4. AMD's Feisty Pledge
CEOs don't get their jobs by being eloquent, and it probably would be too much to expect them to sound statesmanlike. But sometimes their oratorical rough edges cross the line into embarrassing. 
Case in point: Comments from Jerry Sanders, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD:NYSE - news - commentary) , which earlier this week reported a loss for the first time in almost three years. The company, facing harsh pricing competition from Intel (INTC:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , said its revenue was down 22% from a year ago and it expects a likely operating loss for the fourth quarter. 
Given recent declines in consumer confidence, the downturn is likely to be extended by several quarters, Sanders admitted. But in a conference call, he indulged in some spirited fist-shaking. Citing the company's so-called ""Hammer"" architecture for processors, Sanders declared, ""We feel that when the upturn comes, we're going to kick ---."" 
Does this guy carry around a surfboard in his car or what? Mr. Sanders, meet Mr. Reeves. 
OK, so we actually kind of admire Sanders' never-capitulate spirit. But his comment seems a little redundant, because just about everybody will look better when the economy turns around. Because that may not be anytime soon, what matters is how companies weather the interim -- feisty pledges notwithstanding. 
5. Enron's Rabbit-From-a-Hat Style
Analysts have complained for some time about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) rabbit-from-a-hat style accounting, with which the company produced results that wowed investors without making it quite clear where they came from. Now that its business has taken a sour turn, that tendency has gotten even more unsettling. 
To cap off its disappointing earnings results this week -- Enron posted a steep loss after taking a $1.01 billion charge -- the company let drop that its shareholder equity had decreased by $1.2 billion. 
In a conference call, CEO Kenneth Lay attributed the reduction in equity to the ""removal of an obligation to issue a number of shares."" According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, Enron repurchased 55 million shares issued through a series of transactions involving LJM Capital, a partnership that until recently was headed up by Enron's CFO. 
TSC's Peter Eavis has written that it appears Enron lent LJM money to buy Enron stock. 
Ironically, the company boasted in its earnings release this week that it had expanded reporting of its financial results, presumably to quiet its accounting critics. 
Enron's transactions have been so labyrinthine that it's hard to identify exactly if or how they were inappropriate. But the latest revelation, to say the least, does nothing to bolster the company's credibility. Enron, whose CEO resigned unexpectedly in August, had seen its stock fall 59% for the year leading up to its latest earnings release. Since then, it's dropped another 12.6% 


The New Power Company Revises Its Netting Agreement With Enron; Provides For Receivables and Inventory Financing

10/19/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2001--The New Power Company (""NewPower""), a wholly owned subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: NPW) today filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting that it has revised its master netting agreement with Enron North America Corp., Enron Energy Services, Inc., and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (together, the ""Enron Subsidiaries""). 
The amendment affects the Master Cross-Product Netting, Setoff, and Security Agreement (the ""Master Netting Agreement"") among NewPower and the Enron Subsidiaries, and expands through January 4, 2002, the types of collateral that NewPower is permitted to post to the Enron Subsidiaries.
The effect of the amendment is to reduce, through January 4, 2002, the amount of cash collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron Subsidiaries. Under the amended Master Netting Agreement, the first $70 million of posted collateral must be in the form of cash, while amounts in excess of $70 million may consist of not more than $40 million of eligible receivables and inventory of NewPower, valued at discounts specified in the amendment, and subject to a $25 million limit for October 2001. Pledging receivables and inventory is consistent with NewPower's previously announced intention to secure asset-backed financing. 
With the amendment and NewPower's cost reduction efforts, and absent a similar rate of decline in commodity prices or other significant events, NewPower believes that it has sufficient financial resources to conduct its business until it secures ongoing asset-backed financing, which will be necessary upon the expiration of the amendment. NewPower has been and is actively seeking to arrange asset-backed financing with other parties, although to date no such arrangements have been secured. 
The Company expects to meet its previous estimate of net loss and loss per basic and diluted share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2001. However, customer count and revenues are expected to be slightly lower than previously forecast. 
The Company will provide revised guidance for the fourth quarter 2001 and an outlook for 2002 on its third quarter conference call scheduled for Thursday, November 8.

LOBBYING
K Street's Top 10: The Shifting Lineup
Shawn Zeller

10/20/2001
National Journal
Copyright 2001 by National Journal Group Inc. All rights reserved.

How do the Washington lobbying firms with the heftiest incomes put themselves in the upper echelon of K Street practitioners? Van Scoyoc Associates Inc. does it by signing up a stable of smaller clients and working hard to retain them. Quinn Gillespie & Associates doesn't have a long client list, but it is at the top of the heap in terms of average fee per client. Greenberg Traurig, meanwhile, lured away a rival firm's top rainmaker-and his lucrative book of clients. 
These are just some of the business strategies revealed in National Journal's survey of the 10 Washington lobbying firms with the highest fee income from January 1 to June 30. The four top firms at midyear 2001 are the same ones as a year earlier: perennial powerhouses Cassidy & Associates Inc.; Patton Boggs; Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld; and Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand.
But two new players-boasting huge growth rates-are among the firms nipping at the heels of these top dogs. 
Greenberg Traurig, which came in at No. 5 in National Journal's midyear 2001 rankings, had never before been in the top tier of Washington lobbying firms. According to PoliticalMoneyLine, which compiles a comprehensive annual list of all lobbying firms, Greenberg Traurig had the 35th-highest income during the first six months of last year. 
And No. 7 in the midyear 2001 rankings is Quinn Gillespie, another first-time member of the top 10. Formed just a year and a half ago by former Clinton White House Counsel Jack Quinn and Ed Gillespie-a one-time adviser to House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas-the firm has seen its fortunes rocket upward. Quinn Gillespie was No. 13 in the first six months of 2000. 
In between these two newcomers is Van Scoyoc Associates, ranked at No. 6. There has been a steady rise for Van Scoyoc, which was No. 28 in fee income at the end of 1996, the year in which the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act first took effect. 
Rounding out the top 10 at midyear 2001 are stalwarts Williams & Jensen; Washington Council Ernst & Young; and Barbour Griffith & Rogers. 
National Journal ranks the top-10 lobbying firms every six months by tallying the fees that firms report to the House and Senate as required under the 1995 legislation. National Journal tabulates total fees for only the 25 top firms in PoliticalMoneyLine's comprehensive annual survey. 
With its $16.68 million in fees for the first six months of the year, Cassidy & Associates continued to blow away the competition. The last time any firm reported a six-month total larger than Cassidy's was during the first half of 1998, when Verner, Liipfert led the way. During the first six months of this year, Cassidy & Associates received a massive fee of $1 million from the Taiwan Studies Institute, a think tank with close ties to the Taiwanese government; Boeing Co. paid Cassidy & Associates $600,000; and Tiffany & Co. paid it $400,000 to lobby on legislation that would bar diamonds mined in conflict-ridden areas of the world from entering the global market. 
Despite the economic downturn and the terrorist threat, lobbying goes on, company Chairman Gerald S.J. Cassidy said. ""During difficult times, people come to Washington with their problems. During more-robust times, they come seeking opportunities."" 
But the biggest story at midyear was the rise of Greenberg Traurig. The firm, which posted just $1.71 million in lobbying fees during the first half of 2000, saw that amount more than quadruple to nearly $8.7 million this year. Much of the credit goes to Jack Abramoff, the conservative K Street mover and shaker who is an ally of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. Last year, Abramoff left his old firm, Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds, and brought $3 million in business with him to Greenberg Traurig. Preston Gates, which was ranked in the top five during Abramoff's tenure, dropped out of National Journal's rankings this year. The lobbying firm's fees fell by nearly 50 percent. 
Abramoff continued to make rain at Greenberg Traurig, billing $860,000 to the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, $500,000 to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and $300,000 to garment manufacturers that operate in that U.S. territory. A few new clients also forked over big bucks: the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana ($440,000); Voor Huisen Project Management, a homebuilder with international operations ($300,000); and the American International Center ($100,000). Despite initial concerns among some Greenberg Traurig partners about whether Abramoff would fit in, Abramoff insists that his team of lobbyists has been ""totally integrated"" into the firm. 
But Abramoff wasn't the only one responsible for Greenberg Traurig's higher earnings. Ronald W. Kleinman, a former State Department lawyer, persuaded Congress with the help of several Greenberg Traurig colleagues to pass Section 2002 of the 2000 Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act. This section of the law ordered the Treasury Secretary to use Cuban government funds that are frozen in U.S. banks to compensate the families of three men who had won multimillion-dollar judgments against Cuba under a 1996 amendment to the Foreign Sovereignty Immunities Act. The amendment allows victims of terrorism or their families to sue states that are on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. 
Greenberg Traurig represented the families of Armando Alejandre, Carlos Alberto Costa, and Mario M. de la Pena-three members of Brothers to the Rescue, a Cuban-American group that rescues Cubans in the waters off Florida. The three men died when their plane was shot down over international waters on February 24, 1996. The families sued Cuba and were awarded $96.7 million in damages by a U.S. District Court judge in 1997. The State Department opposed payment, but President Clinton signed the trafficking bill. Greenberg Traurig reported a fee of $4 million. 
Fred W. Baggett, the chair of Greenberg Traurig's governmental practice group, said this was a one-time fee, but he added that the Cuban case ""established a platform so that the firm can support undertaking those one-time efforts in the future,"" and noted, ""We have a few coming down the pipeline."" 
Baggett said the firm has cases involving an American killed in Jerusalem by the Palestinian group Hamas, and Americans who were used as human shields in Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. None of the Americans was killed, and all were eventually released. 
Taking the flip side of the mega-fee approach was Van Scoyoc Associates, which reported receiving no fee above $180,000. Nonetheless, the firm continued its steady rise. A key reason, said firm President H. Stewart Van Scoyoc, was the ability to recruit and retain clients. The firm signed up 34 clients between January 1 and June 30, while only nine out of 159 clients terminated contracts during the period. 
""We work hard at defining the relationship with a client before we sign a contract,"" said Van Scoyoc. ""We make sure we're clear on the goals and objectives, and in a typical relationship, we don't guarantee that we can do everything."" The firm's $6.24 million total for the first half of 2001 was 23 percent higher than its fees for the same period last year. 
Quinn Gillespie's ascent into the top 10 was more along the lines of Greenberg Traurig's. Quinn Gillespie's billings were almost $6.09 million at midyear 2001, a 71 percent rise over the same period last year. The firm has only 34 paying clients, but the average fee per client-$180,000-is the highest among the top 10. During the six months, the British Columbia Lumber Trade Council paid a fee of $540,000 to Quinn Gillespie, while Enron Corp. paid $525,000. The Canadian group hoped its high-powered lobbyists would win greater access for Canadian lumber in the United States, but U.S. tariffs were reinstated earlier this year. Lobbying for Enron focused on energy deregulation, particularly in California. Enron is a major creditor of Southern California Edison, the utility whose financial woes resulted in power shortages in California last summer. 
Quinn Gillespie's staff has grown from nine at the time of the founding to nearly 30 today. ""We like to think we have a toolbox here-people who may be Republicans or Democrats but who also have different skills that benefit the client,"" Quinn said. 
Patton Boggs had fees of $10.26 million in the first six months of 2001, but that was just a 5 percent rise over the same period in 2000. Still, the firm leapfrogged over Verner, Liipfert to capture the No. 2 ranking. Patton Boggs earned $360,000 from Russia's government-owned NTV television network, which was at the center of a controversy earlier this year when the government took over the independent network and ousted its staff. 
Akin, Gump also jumped past Verner, Liipfert to No. 3 in the rankings, posting $9.48 million in fees-a 16 percent increase over a year earlier. Akin, Gump's biggest client was the troubled tire manufacturer Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., which paid just over $1.5 million in fees. Akin, Gump also earned big money from AT&T ($800,000) and the Gila River Indian Community ($620,000). 
At No. 4, Verner, Liipfert saw the biggest drop in fees, taking in $8.84 million in the first six months of 2001-down 16 percent from the same period in 2000. Verner, Liipfert lost lucrative contracts with Puerto Rico after the government there changed hands last year. (See this issue, p. 3273.) 
Rounding out the top-10 rankings, Williams & Jensen at No. 8 billed $5.68 million, a 12 percent increase over the first half of 2000, while Washington Council Ernst & Young saw its fees drop 11 percent to $5.5 million. The firm fell four places to No. 9 in the rankings. Barbour Griffith & Rogers's fee income was up 7 percent to $5.48 million, putting the firm at No. 10. 
Falling out of the midyear top-10 rankings were Preston Gates-No. 6 at midyear 2000-and PricewaterhouseCoopers, No. 7 last year. PricewaterhouseCoopers's billings were $5 million for the period, a 6 percent drop from the first half of 2000.

Houston entrepreneurs added to Texas Business Hall of Fame 
By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The Texas Business Hall of Fame's annual awards ceremony Thursday night honored four Houston business leaders. 
The event at the George R. Brown Convention Center put the spotlight on Weingarten Realty Investors Chairman Stanford Alexander; Compaq Computer founder and former Chief Executive Officer Rod Canion; retired Reliant Energy Chairman and CEO Don Jordan; and Dynegy Chairman and CEO Chuck Watson. 
This is the 19th year the nonprofit Texas Business Hall of Fame Foundation has honored the state's business leaders with a dinner and induction event. 
As chairman of Weingarten Realty Investors, Stanford Alexander built the company into one of the nation's largest publicly traded real estate companies. 
After serving in the U.S. Air Force, Alexander joined J. Weingarten, a Houston-based chain of 87 supermarkets. He later became an executive with Weingarten Markets Realty Co., an affiliated real estate firm that developed free-standing supermarket stores. 
The firm later changed its name to Weingarten Realty. The Houston-based company is now publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Weingarten owns shopping centers, warehouses and other property in 17 states from coast to coast. 
Weingarten's notable developments in Houston include the upscale Village Arcade near Rice University and the Centre at Post Oak, across from the Galleria. 
Rod Canion came up with the idea behind Compaq in 1982 after a trip to a local ComputerLand store. Along with colleagues from Texas Instruments, Jim Harris and industrial designer Ted Papajohn, Canion envisioned a portable computer that ran all the programs that operated on the IBM PC. 
By the next year, the company was producing the original Compaq luggable computer, a move that essentially created the modern PC industry. By 1987, its fifth year, the company made business history by breaking $1 billion in sales, the fastest pace ever for a corporate startup. 
Canion left Compaq in October 1991 but continued to be active in other ventures. In 1992, he founded Insource Technology Group, a consulting services and network engineering firm, and continues to serve as chairman. 
Don Jordan has been in the forefront of Houston business and society for decades. And even though he retired from the post of chairman and chief executive at Reliant Energy in late 1999, he has remained active in the city's growth and development. 
Jordan was with Reliant and its predecessor Houston Industries for 44 years and helped position the company for its eventual split between the company's regulated businesses, such as HL&P and Entex, and unregulated business that is now called Reliant Resources. 
Jordan, along with his corporate rival Ken Lay of Enron, was instrumental in the successful campaign last year to convince voters to approve the use of public funds to build a new arena downtown for the Houston Rockets. 
Jordan has spent a lot of time on the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo board and many other civic groups. 
Chuck Watson has built Dynegy into one of Houston's leading energy companies, but he is more well-known for his forays into the world of sports. 
Watson established NGC Corp., Dynegy's predecessor, in 1985 and served as president until becoming chairman and chief executive officer in 1989. 
Recently Watson was revealed to be the largest investor in the limited partnership assembled to put together the Texans, Houston's National Football League franchise. It begins playing next year. 
Watson also owns the Aeros, Houston's American Hockey League team. 
Watson's support was also pivotal to getting voters last year to approve the use of public funds for the new downtown arena. Watson had opposed an earlier deal to use public money to build the facility. 
Watson has also been a strong supporter of Houston's bid to land the 2012 Olympic Games. 
To date, the foundation has awarded more than $1.8 million in scholarships to students pursuing business degree at Texas colleges and universities. 

Recession, Budget Cuts, Travel Fears To Subdue LME Week
By Mark Long
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/19/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The many travails of the metals industry will dampen the spirits of those who make it to the annual round of meetings and parties at London Metal Exchange Week, which starts Monday. 
In what is expected to be a much smaller group of delegates than usual, conversations will be dominated by fears of global recession smothering already-lousy demand, the increasingly pressing need for production cuts, and the exit of several important participants from the metals business.
Cuts in companies' travel budgets and fears of flying are keeping many of the usual attendees away from London this year, dealers and analysts said. 
""Sentiment is going to be bearish, and we've just heard in the past few days of people who were previously going to come along not coming, largely on their companies' advice,"" said Adam Rowley, an analyst at MacQuarie Bank in London. 
Indeed, a representative at another major bank said fully half of the guests expected at its satellite activities have canceled. 
Forecasts for base metals demand and average prices have been widely revised downward in the past few weeks, particularly since the impact of the Sept. 11 terror attacks accelerated the world economic slowdown. 
Just this week, Standard Bank ratcheted its expectations lower, with LME cash copper - a bellwether for the complex that's especially sensitive to industrial productivity - seen at $1,350 a metric ton in December 2001, down from an actual year-to-date average in 2001 of $1,619/ton. 
Producers are reluctant to cut copper output, and declining Chinese imports and weak demand in the west mean there is still further downside potential for copper, Standard Bank analyst Robin Bhar said. 
With demand for base metals slumping so sharply, eyes have been turning to the producers to make moves on the supply side. 
In copper, analysts say U.S. producers are the most likely to cut back, as the recent strength in the dollar hits their bottom line the hardest. However, a recent slump in energy prices has kept the wolves from the door so far for some producers in an industry that's energy-intensive. 
Elsewhere, zinc is suffering from a supply glut that recently pressured the LME three-month price to a 17-year low of $766 a metric ton. 
The troubles of Australian zinc producer Pasminco Ltd. (A.PAS) will surely be a hot topic, following the company's move to voluntary administration due to its large debt load, dealers said. 
But aside from all the market concerns, the most worrisome topic will likely be the recent succession of companies bailing out of or reducing their commitment to the metals business, market participants said. 
In the past week, N.M. Rothschild & Sons Ltd. quit the base metals business and ScotiaMocatta - the metals trading arm of the Bank of Nova Scotia (T.BNS) - removed itself from open-outcry ring trade at the LME. Earlier this month, Enron Metals said it would cut staff by 10%-20% in Europe, and all these moves follow Mitsui Bussan Commodities Ltd. ditching its market-making activities in the metals business earlier this year. 
Who's next? 
""It could be anyone,"" is the refrain from nearly all market participants surveyed.

HC to hear DPC's plea

10/19/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court will, on December 11, begin hearing a petition filed by Enron-promoted Dhabol Power Company (DPC), challenging the jurisdiction of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) to adjudicate the US-based multinational's dispute with Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). 
A division bench headed by Justice Ajit Shah decided to hear the matter at a stretch for a week beginning from December 11. The court permitted MERC members P. Subrahmanyam and Venkat Chary to be impleaded as respondents. They have been asked to file affidavits by November 9.
The multinational power giant had levelled certain allegations of bias against an MERC member Jayant Deo. Mr Deo urged the court that he would like to recluse himself from the proceedings. 
DPC was allowed to amend its main petition in view of the allegations levelled against Mr Deo and were asked to amend it within week. 
In his affidavit replying to allegations of bias by the DPC, Mr Deo said he was neutral in his stand as a MERC member. 
The court has made it clear that when the hearing in the case commences, two intervening parties, US Exim Bank and a consortium of 11 offshore lenders of DPC would not be allowed to make any pleadings. The court, however, said they would be permitted to assist the court by making oral submissions.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Hello everyone.  I've contacted you all because Regulatory Affairs (Becky and I) are attempting to stop sending you so much paper.  Our goal is to still keep you all informed but in a more effective, efficient, and timely manner.  This is where Livelink comes in.  Livelink is a web-based tool that you all will be able to enter from the Govt.Affairs homepage.  In Livelink, there will be the filings, maps, rate increases, etc. that we usually send you via interoffice mail.  In addition, the files from the file room will eventually be added.

Livelink is only going to be as successful as what's put into it.  This is where you and your group comes into play.  Becky and I don't want to put ""junk"" into it.  We want what's relevant to you and your team.  Of course, this is all relative.  What's important to one person and/or group is not going to be high priority to another. 

We will have a meeting Wednesday, the 17th to meet and discuss what's in livelink and look to you all for your valuable input on what you would like to see that's relevant to your team.  Please reply to the invite and/or send comments.

Thanks,

Melinda

Justice Dept. to Form Task Force To Investigate Collapse of Enron

Widening the potential scope of the criminal investigation into the Enron Corporation, the Justice Department plans to form a special task force of prosecutors from across the country to conduct the inquiry into the company and its eventual collapse, government officials said yesterday. 

At the same time, the decision will reduce the burdens going forward on Enron, which has been struggling with the demands from multiple civil and criminal investigations. By consolidating the criminal investigations, the company will have only one coordinated group of prosecutors seeking information, decreasing the potential demands for documents and limiting the number of officials to persuade of its position.

Legal experts said the decision to create such a task force on a white-collar case involving a single company was virtually unheard-of and signaled that the government might elevate the case to a level of significance usually reserved for investigations of entire industries. 

The task force will bring together prosecutors from several United States attorneys' offices -- including those in Houston, New York City and San Francisco -- with all of them reporting through the department's criminal division, officials said. In addition, prosecutors from the fraud section, part of the criminal division, will be part of the task force. 

''This is a case of national scope and national significance that is going to require coordination and manpower, and the task force is a way of achieving that,'' one official said. 

Robert S. Bennett, a Washington lawyer who represents the company, said last night that he saw the department's decision as positive. ''I'm pleased that there now appears to be some centralization and coordination, because it is very difficult and expensive to deal with half a dozen different entities,'' he said. ''This is a company in bankruptcy, and it needs to be given a fair shot to come out of bankruptcy and increase the value for stakeholders. If we get caught in a cumbersome scandal machine, that may not happen.'' 

While the decision to form the task force is final, many details have yet to be worked out, officials said. Some prosecutors involved in the case have not been notified of their specific roles in the task force, and other decisions about where the group will work and how the various strands of investigation will be coordinated have not been determined. 

The Justice Department has formed numerous task forces in the past, but they have usually focused either on complex cases of violent crime or conducted inquiries into practices by entire industries. 

Legal experts who have examined the Enron case said yesterday that by bringing together the disparate pieces of the sprawling criminal investigation of the company, the government is overcoming hurdles that might have hampered the inquiry if it was conducted in separate offices. 

For example, while federal prosecutors in Manhattan have the most experience in investigating complex white-collar cases, they might face difficulty in meeting the requirement that potential crimes took place in their geographical jurisdiction. And while prosecutors in Houston, where Enron is based, would have no such problems, they do not have the same experience in white-collar cases. 

By bringing the prosecutors together, while simultaneously adding the manpower from the department's fraud section, legal experts said, the government is raising the probability of indictments. 

''Prosecutors tend to indict what they investigate,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia University who has testified in Congress on the Enron case. ''This kind of task force for an individual investigation is without precedent, and while it doesn't guarantee an indictment, it certainly raises the stakes.'' 

But some past efforts by the Justice Department to take a more central role in a criminal investigation of a corporation with influence in Washington have raised concerns about potential political influence over the inquiry. For example, in the 1990's, when part of an inquiry involving the Archer Daniels Midland Company was assigned to the fraud section, some critics contended -- to the vehement denials of Justice officials -- that Washington was trying to protect Archer, the politically influential grain company. Enron, whose officers have been close to both President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, has exercised similar political influence in the past. 

In addition to the inquiry being conducted by the Justice Department, Enron's collapse is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and several Congressional committees. 

Meanwhile, in Enron's bankruptcy proceedings, parts of the company are now up for auction to the highest bidder. For example, an auction of its trading business is scheduled to take place today, and a spokeswoman said it should be presented to the bankruptcy court at a hearing tomorrow. But a speedy approval by the court is not assured. Several creditors have filed objections to the auction because they are worried that they will not have time to evaluate whether all or parts of the business will be sold at a fair price. 

Creditors have also expressed concern about what would happen to the proceeds from the sale. Creditors of Enron North America, the unit that owns the trading business, want to make sure that the money goes to them and is not distributed among all the company's creditors. 

In Houston yesterday, in a suit filed by investors against 29 Enron directors and officers, a federal judge dealt a setback to plaintiffs by declining to freeze more than $1 billion that they say the directors and officers gained from the sale of Enron shares while hiding information about the company's decline. However, the judge also told defendants that she had the power to freeze the assets if necessary.

U.S. Puts Task Force on Criminal Probe of Enron
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/10/2002
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

The Justice Department said a task force has been formed to pursue a criminal investigation of Enron Corp., confirming a probe that is expected to center on possible accounting fraud. 

The investigation will be run by the department's criminal division coordinating among U.S. Attorneys in New York City, San Francisco, Houston and elsewhere. The Wall Street Journal first reported the criminal investigation in early December.

Enron, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas, filed for bankruptcy-court protection following a crisis of confidence among its investors. The problems have resulted largely from Enron's dealings with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives. The company saw its market value plunge recently to about $540 million from more than $77 billion last year. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been investigating Enron since October, and the Justice Department could both file cases alleging violations of securities laws if Enron is found to have intentionally misled investors about its financial condition. Several Congressional committees also have begun inquiries into various aspects of Enron's collapse. 

Enron acknowledged that it is the target of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. ""It has been the posture of the company to fully cooperate with government investigations,"" said Robert Bennett, an attorney with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, which represents the company. ""At the end of day, I'm pretty optimistic . . . an objective person will see that many of the things said and written [about Enron] aren't true."" 

Confirmation of the probe came even as nearly two dozen firms asked a U.S. bankruptcy-court judge to temporarily block Enron's intended sale of its energy-trading business, until recently the earnings juggernaut for the entire company. 

The court approved an auction process on Dec. 19 that was to have resulted in the announcement of the winning bidder as early as tomorrow. 

Bidders for pieces of Enron's energy-trading business, which still has a staff of about 1,000 people, include Citigroup Inc., UBS AG and BP PLC, people familiar with the matter have said. 

But a host of creditors have asked the court to delay the sale indefinitely. The list includes financial institutions such as Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and GE Capital Corp. as well as power-trading rivals such as Mirant Corp., El Paso Merchant Energy LP and Aquila Inc., a unit of Utilicorp United Inc. 

Aquila said it doesn't oppose the sale, per se, but wants guarantees that Enron will put the proceeds in an escrow account until a determination has been made about how it will be split among creditors. 

Mirant, Atlanta, in its pleadings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, said the sales materials circulated by Enron lacked ""significant material information that is essential . . . to make an informed decision regarding the wisdom of the transaction."" 

The materials lack a minimum bid, which ""begs the question,"" Mirant said, ""as to whether there is a bid that is simply too low to accept or whether the debtors are preparing to sell at any price."" Challengers also questioned who would be responsible for liabilities excluded from the sale. 

Enron's energy-marketing unit, which includes its once-mighty EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform, traded dozens of products until recently and generated roughly 90% of the firm's earnings in the most recent quarter. It also was responsible for the bulk of Enron's 2001 revenue of $101 billion. 

In bankruptcy-court documents filed in December, Enron said the company's wholesale-trading business, of which the energy-trading unit is a major part, had assets of about $13 billion and liabilities of at least $8 billion. 

Concerns over Enron's financial strength and the integrity of its accounting practices caused trading partners to back away from doing business with it starting in mid-October. From that point on, a significant portion of Enron's trading volume came from customers trying to wind down their Enron-related positions. The unit ceased meaningful operations prior to Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy-court filing. 

Resuscitation will require a cash infusion from a trusted partner with a blue-chip credit rating, the company has said. It has proposed transferring assets to a new venture in which Enron would retain a 49% position. The new investor would control the partnership, that has been dubbed New Energy Trading Company LP. 

An Enron spokesman said the firm would press to go ahead with the proposal. ""It's in the best interest of Enron and its creditors to get the trading operation started as soon as possible to get as much value for the estate as possible,"" said spokesman Mark Palmer.

U.S. opens criminal inquiry into Enron
Justice sets up probe of financial collapse 


By DAVID IVANOVICH 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Justice Department acknowledged Wednesday it has launched a criminal investigation into the epic fall of Houston's Enron Corp. 

Attorneys from the Justice Department's fraud section, along with prosecutors from Houston, New York and San Francisco among other cities, will form a special task force to examine the collapse of the nation's seventh-largest company, a Justice official confirmed Wednesday. 

The energy and trading giant sought protection from its creditors on Dec. 2, becoming the largest bankruptcy case in U.S. corporate history. 

For weeks, the Justice Department has been known to be looking into the Enron debacle, as have the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Labor Department and a host of congressional panels. 

""This is basically an issue of national scope,"" said the Justice official, who asked not to be identified. ""Because there have been so many questions about this and because there has been so much interest, we are simply acknowledging the investigation."" 

Robert Bennett, a Washington-based attorney representing Enron in the nation's capital, argued the Justice Department's action is actually ""a positive development."" 

""There will be a unification and a structure to the investigation,"" Bennett said. ""We won't have to deal with six or seven different offices."" 

Since the company's dizzying fall, Enron has been overwhelmed by a blizzard of lawsuits, investigations and subpoenas. 

On Wednesday, the Senate Banking Committee became the sixth congressional panel to jump into the swirl of Enron investigations. 

Responding to fiascoes at companies such as Enron and Houston trash hauler Waste Management, the committee, headed by Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., plans to hold a hearing Feb. 12 to examine accounting and investor protections. 

Waste Management, which was accused of inflating corporate earnings, agreed in November to pay $457 million to settle a class-action suit. Andersen, Waste Management's auditor, agreed to pay a $7 million SEC fine and another $20 million to Waste Management shareholders for failing to catch the company's accounting excesses. 

Sarbanes' committee plans to call five former SEC heads to suggest ways to avoid future debacles. 

""Enron is not the sole focus of the hearing,"" said Sarbanes' spokesman, Jesse Jacobs. 

Lawmakers have been clamoring for Enron Chief Executive Ken Lay and other Enron executives to appear before their panels, and they have vowed to subpoena them unless they agree to come voluntarily. 

Lay has promised to appear Feb. 4 before the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs. 

The House Energy and Commerce Committee has collected thousands of pages of documents and interviewed a number of current and former Enron officials. 

Prior to the company's collapse, Lay, a longtime supporter of President Bush, was one of the most politically influential businessmen in America with relatively easy access to the Bush White House. 

On Tuesday, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., released a letter from Vice President Dick Cheney's office detailing six meetings between Enron executives and White House officials over an eight-month period. 

""The Washington scandal machine is being pumped up, and everybody for their own reasons wants a piece of the action,"" said Bennett, who represented former President Clinton in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. 

""There's an unfortunate rush to judgment here,"" Bennett said. ""Hopefully, people will calm down a little bit and let these investigations proceed."" 

Enron's breathtaking collapse began in October, when the company revealed that $1.2 billion worth of shareholder equity had evaporated, largely because of the accounting treatment of some off-balance-sheet joint ventures. 

That news shook investor confidence in the company and began a free-fall of the company's stock. 

Joseph Berardino, head of Enron's outside auditor Andersen, told a House panel last month Enron officials failed to provide examiners with required information and may have committed ""possible illegal acts."" 

Enron employees and retirees have complained loudly about the loss of retirement funds because of the company's collapse. Participants in the company's 401(k) retirement plan were barred from selling their Enron shares just as the stock was nosediving because of management's decision to change plan administrators. 

The Justice Department's revelation about the criminal investigation task force comes just as Enron is scheduled today to hold an auction for a majority stake in the company's most lucrative operation, its trading business. 

Three firms, including Citigroup and UBS Warburg, submitted proposals Monday to take control of the trading operation. Other companies could join the bidding today in what industry analysts say could be a billion-dollar transaction. 

 

 

Justice Department begins criminal probe of Enron collapse

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation of Enron Corp., the bankrupt energy company whose collapse caused many employees to lose their life's savings. 

An attorney for Enron welcomed the inquiry, the latest in a series of governmental probes into the company's demise, saying the investigation would ""bring light to the facts.""

""We want to get to the bottom of this too,"" said Robert Bennett, a Washington attorney representing the Houston-based company. ""A lot of decent and honorable people work at Enron and we should wait until the facts are out."" 

The Justice Department is forming a national task force to look into the company's dealings. The group will be headed by lawyers at the department's criminal division and include prosecutors in Houston, San Francisco, New York and several other cities, said a Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 

The official declined to say when the investigation began. Enron faces civil investigations by the Labor Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission and subpoenas from congressional committees. 

All are looking into the energy trading company's collapse, the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. 

The failure hit employees and investors hard. Workers were prohibited from selling company stock from their Enron-heavy 401(k) retirement accounts as the company's stock plummeted. Many lost their life's savings. 

Enron executives cashed out more than $1 billion in stock when it was near its peak. 

Formed in 1985, Enron had 20,000 employees and was once the world's top buyer and seller of natural gas and the largest electricity marketer in the United States. It also marketed coal, pulp, paper, plastics, metals and fiber-optic bandwidth. 

One likely focus of the Justice Department investigation is possible fraud based on Enron's heavy reliance on off-balance-sheet partnerships which took on Enron debt. The partnerships masked Enron's financial problems and left its credit ratings healthy so it could obtain the cash and credit crucial to running its trading business. 

The Houston-based company went bankrupt after its credit collapsed and its main rival, Dynegy Inc., backed out of an $8.4 billion buyout plan late last year. 

Just a year ago, stock of the nation's largest buyer and seller of natural gas traded at $85 per share. Today it is less than $1. 

Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay has close ties to President Bush and his father, former President Bush. Lay was a top contributor to the younger Bush's 2000 presidential campaign. 

Last week, the president said: ""I think the life savings issue is something we need to look into. ... The government will be looking into this."" 

Lay also gave $25,000 to a leadership committee headed by then-senator and now Attorney General John Ashcroft, according to the Center for Public Integrity. 

The company played a key role earlier this year when a White House task force met with business executives and other interests to fashion a national energy policy. The task force was headed by Vice President Dick Cheney. 

The White House has acknowledged that Enron representatives met six times with Cheney or his aides on energy issues last year, most recently in mid-October just before the investing public realized the company was heading for disaster. 

The vice president's office said the last Enron meeting with a Cheney aide was Oct. 10, just six days before the first in a series of public admissions by the company about its true financial condition that sent it careening into bankruptcy court. 

Enron's financial position wasn't discussed in any of the meetings, vice presidential counsel David Addington said in a letter. 

On Wednesday, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters: ""I'm not aware of anybody in the White House who discussed Enron's financial situation.""

Judge declines to freeze profits of Enron officers 


By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle

A federal judge said Wednesday she has the authority to freeze hundreds of millions of dollars in assets that Enron Corp. insiders earned through selling their stock, but declined to do so. 

U.S. District Court Judge Lee Rosenthal cited a 1999 Supreme Court opinion for her authority to freeze the assets of the 29 Enron executives and board members named in a lawsuit filed on behalf of a number of worker retirement funds. But she ruled there were insufficient grounds for issuing such an order based on the evidence and arguments she has heard so far. 

In her ruling Rosenthal wrote she would not order the restraining order on the assets "" ... without allegations or evidence that each, or any, defendant has, or is likely to, conceal the stock sales proceeds or profits or place them beyond reach, absent immediate judicial intervention."" 

Enron officials were not immediately available for comment. 

The lawsuit, filed by New York-based Amalgamated Bank in November, alleges that Enron executives and board members sold $1.1 billion in Enron stock over the past three years while not disclosing that the stock price was overvalued. Amalgamated Bank manages pension funds that hold Enron stock. 

The lawsuit claims the company officials were aware of accounting problems that led to inflated earnings reports and higher stock prices. 

In November 2001, Enron reported it was adjusting its earnings for the past 4 1/2 years because of bookkeeping errors related to investment partnerships it had formed. That included a $586 million reduction in net income, adding $2.5 billion in debt to its books and a 77-cent reduction in earnings per share. 

""We are gratified that we have cleared this important legal hurdle,"" said Amalgamated's attorney Bill Lerach in a statement Wednesday. ""We are also pleased that the court has held open the possibility that we may conduct discovery to obtain additional evidence to justify the requested injunction."" 

In a Dec. 7 hearing, Lerach asked the judge to freeze the assets of the Enron insiders, including Chairman and CEO Ken Lay and former Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling, claiming there was a danger they would flee the country with the profits from exercising their stock options. Lay netted $16.1 million in stock sales for the first nine months of 2001, according to data compiled by Thomson Financial/First Call, while Skilling collected $15.5 million. 

Attorneys representing Enron denied that their clients would do so and challenged the court's authority to freeze assets. 

In her ruling this week, Rosenthal ordered Amalgamated to file a brief in support of its request for expedited discovery into the case by Jan. 23 and for Enron and its executives to file a response by Feb. 6.

 

VIEWPOINTS
White House Was a Home For Enron
Robert Reno

Newsday
ALL EDITIONS

(Copyright Newsday Inc., 2002)

PRESIDENT George W. Bush says he's had ""no contact with Enron officials in the last six weeks."" 

That's a relief. It shows he has sense enough to know when a corporation has turned radioactive and is best approached at the end of a 10-foot pole. Still, this leaves almost an entire year in which Enron officials waltzed in and out of the White House enjoying an unusual degree of access. The Washington Post reports that Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides found time to meet with Enron officials on six occasions in 2001.

On the face of it, this may not even seem excessive for an administration in which corporate interests have been given an extraordinary degree of influence. And besides, David S. Addington, the vice president's counsel, wrote a letter insisting that ""Enron did not communicate information about its financial position in any of the meetings with the vice president or with the National Energy Development Group's support staff."" 

That's a relief as well. Since Enron's financial troubles weren't discussed, this presumably shows Enron wasn't looking for some squalid favor that would permit it to avoid one of the most spectacular bankruptcies in history. 

It was probably just seeking to influence some government action that would advance the general interests of Enron, perhaps relief from some obnoxious regulation promulgated in the Clinton administration that stood between Enron and its ambitions to become the world's largest corporation. And in the energy-friendly Bush administration, what more logical place to come than the White House? 

Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) can be forgiven his cynicism about these Enron meetings. He said, ""It shows Enron far exceeded the access provided by the White House to other parties interested in energy policy."" Certainly, it exceeds the access that would be granted to, say, a bunch of high-minded old ladies in hand-knitted sweaters pleading against a rape of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Anyway, White House officials said the Enron meetings reflected nothing more sinister than the ""open and inclusive"" policy of the vice president's energy task force. They made it sound like all the meetings had taken place in plain sight on the White lawn. 

Anyway, the Enron meetings continued until just days before the company started to collapse. Cheney's aides met with executives of Enron's German subsidiary on Aug. 7 and with Enron officials on Oct. 10. Six days later, Enron's troubles became news, and the shell of its assets became transparent to the world. 

A little more than a month later, Enron announced $55 million in bonuses to 500 key employees. Another 4,000 employees got pink slips and $4,500 in severance pay to console them for 401(k) balances that had become close to worthless because the bulk of it was in Enron shares. 

This gave off an odor of favoritism until it was explained that somebody had to be induced to stay around and pick over the bones of Enron's carcass for what assets could be preserved. The $55 million began to look like a small price to pay for this, considering that last year the corporation had $101 billion in sales.

WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday said it was likely to soon propose new policies to guard against a repeat of the bankruptcy of Enron Corp., which has prompted a Justice Department criminal probe. 

White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, asked about the probe, told Reuters it was important to get to the bottom of the Enron collapse and develop new policies to protect workers and pensioners.

""It's important for the investigation to proceed to determine what was done and why it was done. The president also believes it's important to explore new policies so it (a similar collapse) can never happen again,"" Fleischer said. 

Asked whether new policies would be announced soon, he said, ""likely.""

USA: Enron creditors gearing up for haggling at auction.
By Dane Hamilton

01/09/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Creditors of Enron Corp. have shifted into high gear in anticipation of an expected intense day of haggling Thursday when the bankrupt energy company auctions off its trading operations. 

So far, two financial bidders, Citicorp Inc. and UBS Warburg , have submitted bids for the Houston-based company's biggest business, sources said. But both Enron and creditors are hoping other companies may jump into the fray for all or parts of Enron's electricity and gas trading operations.

To take part, a bidder needs only to submit a sealed bid and a certified check for $25 million, to be returned if the bid is not chosen. British oil giant BP Plc , for instance, said it is interested in a small part, but not all, of Enron's trading operations, but left the door open to enlarge its bid later. 

The auction is set to take place at 10 a.m. at the New York office of Enron's attorneys, Weil Gotshal & Manges. Enron lawyers will evaluate bids with a 15-member unsecured creditors committee and could present its recommendations to U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur Gonzales Friday. 

Enron, once the world's biggest energy trading company, is seeking a well-heeled backer to take a controlling stake in the Enron trading operations and guarantee contracts. 

The company, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2, is aiming to revive the moribund trading operations to generate cash to pay off creditors. It is hoping eventually to emerge from the debt shield under Chapter 11, a prospect that can take months or years. 

Thursday's auction is likely to be a drawn-out affair, where negotiators will likely pressure bidders to sweeten offers by playing them off against each other. 

""This is not like Sothebys,"" said one member of Enron's unsecured creditors committee, a panel chosen by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court trustee to represent the interests of banks, bondholders and other stakeholders in Enron. ""It could go on all day and conceivably into the night."" 

This committee member, who asked for anonymity, said Enron lawyers and the committee could agree on a bidder or ask for more time. Or they could decide Enron is better off keeping the business. 

A key point of discussions this week was the distribution of the proceeds of cash flow from a revival of Enron's trading operation, which generated the bulk of Enron's $95 billion in 2000 revenue in wholesale services, by far its largest division, people familiar with the discussions said. 

But these people denied news reports that characterized the discussions as a dispute with Enron and said any issues are likely to be resolved in a way that will not hold up the auction. 

""This is a very extreme and inaccurate statement of fact to suggest there is a dispute,"" said one creditor representative. ""We are undertaking due diligence to support the right action. That is what we are supposed to be doing as a creditors committee."" 

Another committee member said creditors have asked for more information on the nature and extent of the bids on the table. But this member said there is a general agreement to resolve the issues as soon as possible. 

""I don't think we have enough information now as to whether we should endorse this sale,"" said this member. 

But he said there is agreement to expedite the sale in the hopes of reviving Enron's most valuable operation. 

""The longer you wait, the staler the trading operation becomes,"" he said. 

This member said there have been objections filed in the U.S. bankruptcy court to the sale of the trading operations. But those objections were filed before any bids came in. He said it seemed ""questionable"" to object to a sale that may benefit the bankrupt company's estate without knowing the offer.

WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Congress' investigative arm said on Wednesday he would decide within a month whether to sue the White House over its refusal to name industry executives the administration met with last year while drafting its new energy policy. 

Comptroller General David Walker had been heading for a court clash with the administration last year, but postponed a decision after the Sept. 11 hijack attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

Now, any decision by him to sue would add to Capitol Hill's scrutiny of the collapsed energy giant, Enron , whose executives the White House has acknowledged consulting while drawing up its energy plan. 

Citing the right of Congress to oversee the executive branch, Walker, head of the General Accounting Office, began trying last May to get details of the workings of the administration task force that drew up the energy program. 

Environmental groups say they were mostly shut out of the sessions of the task force, which was headed by Vice President Dick Cheney. They suspect private sector experts such as Enron heavily influenced the Bush energy plan. 

Enron was a major backer of Bush's election campaign, Bush himself is a former oil man, and Cheney was formerly head of Halliburton Co. , the world's No. 1. oilfield services company. 

The policy announced by Bush in May urged more oil and gas drilling and a revived nuclear power program. But the White House says it consulted widely in its energy policy review. 

And the White House largely rebuffed the GAO's efforts to get the information about the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), as the task force was called. 

""I expect to make a decision on whether to file suit regarding GAO's access to NEPDG records within a month,"" Walker said in a brief statement on Wednesday. 

Walker began his probe of the energy task force after Rep. Henry Waxman and Rep. John Dingell, both Democrats, asked him to investigate. 

ENRON DRAWS SCRUTINY 

Recently the energy task force controversy had seemed to all but evaporate. Then last month Waxman seized on the spectacular collapse of Enron to write to Cheney's office again and ask what contacts the task force had with Enron. 

The White House said in a letter released on Tuesday that Cheney or the energy task force staff met six times with Enron representatives last year. 

Walker's spokesman Jeff Nelligan refused to be say whether the White House's revelations about Enron - or the five congressional committees probing Enron - made a GAO lawsuit over the energy task force more or less likely. 

In any case, Waxman is seeking more information from the White House about its Enron contacts. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday the vice president's office was reviewing the new request from Waxman. 

""I'm not aware of anybody in the White House who discussed Enron's financial situation,"" Fleischer added.

You'll have to look long and extremely hard to come up with an example of corporate treachery in the United States that's as horrible as the Enron debacle. This is a scandal with a very broad reach and it has some of the wise guys in the Bush administration and other top Republicans trembling in their penny loafers. 

Enron was a bonanza for -- whom else? -- the folks at the top of the pyramid. They ferociously exploited their gilt-edged political connections and harvested breathtaking amounts of cash for themselves, even as the company was collapsing into the biggest bankruptcy mess in U.S. history. Left behind were thousands of ordinary working men and women, people with families and obligations, who lost jobs, life savings, pensions, the works. And more carnage is to come.

The fallout is nationwide. A week before Christmas, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, spoke about the gloom that had settled over workers in his state who watched their retirement funds vanish. ''Because of what happened at Enron,'' he said, ''there are Oregon families going to grief counseling rather than holiday parties this year.'' 

No one knows yet the extent of the illegality -- if any -- that went on at Enron. The Justice Department announced yesterday that it was launching a criminal investigation. But there is no doubt that many of the company's top officials swam, as a matter of course, in an ethical sewer. They were pals with, and lavishly greased the palms of, powerful people who were willing to guide government policy toward Enron's ends, and who could help the company escape close scrutiny of its more sinister activities. 

The Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog agency in Washington, examined the political contributions of 29 top Enron executives and directors named in a shareholder lawsuit filed against the company last month. Twenty-four of the 29 made contributions from 1999 to 2001 -- totaling nearly $800,000 -- to George W. Bush, members of Congress, the two national political parties (with the bulk of the contributions going to the Republicans) and a variety of officials who are now responsible for investigating possible securities fraud by Enron. 

Of the five who did not make contributions, two were foreign nationals prohibited by law from contributing to candidates or parties. 

''The folks at the top of the company gave lavishly,'' said Charles Lewis, the center's executive director. ''It just shows that this is a company inordinately dependent on government favors.'' 

And how did these generous Enron officials behave as the apocalypse approached? 

The shareholders' suit, as the center noted in its study, ''alleges that the 29 executives and directors dumped $1.1 billion worth of stock while knowing the company was in danger of collapse.'' 

Defendants in the lawsuit have disputed the charges against them. But there is no disputing that as Enron toppled and fell, insiders unloaded hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock while rank-and-file Enron employees were locked into rules that left many of them helpless as the stock's value plunged from more than $90 a share to less than $1. 

It has long been known that Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay, were close to President Bush. In Mr. Lewis's book, ''The Buying of the President 2000,'' Enron was already listed as Mr. Bush's No. 1 career patron. 

This week the office of Vice President Dick Cheney reluctantly disclosed that Enron executives met with Mr. Cheney or his aides at least six times as the Bush administration -- with Mr. Cheney in charge -- was putting together its national energy policy. 

It will be interesting to find out, as this scandal continues to unfold, how aggressively the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other appropriate agencies investigate a company that has been as generous and as wired and as powerfully influential as Enron. 

There's already talk that Harvey Pitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., may have to recuse himself because as a lawyer in private practice he did work for Arthur Andersen, the company that audited Enron's books with its eyes closed. 

Enron is a case study in the dangers that will inevitably arise when unrestrained corporate greed is joined at the hip with the legalized bribery and influence-peddling that passes for government these days.

So now we know why the White House has spent the better part of a year fending off congressional efforts to find out who Vice President Dick Cheney met with for input on his energy task force. Turns out that the vice president and his staff had at least six meetings with representatives from Enron--including one with Chairman Kenneth L. Lay--the last of which occurred just six days before the company revealed that it had vastly overstated its earnings, signaling the beginning of the end for the energy giant. 

Since the Enron collapse, President Bush has been acting like Lay was just some good ol' boy who also happened to hail from Texas. This new information proves otherwise: that Lay and his company's sizable political contributions had bought what Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) has termed ""extensive access"" to the epicenter of American political power. It's Teapot Dome, the Sequel.

During his run for the White House, Bush fought long and hard to convince us that he was a new breed of conservative--a Compassionate Conservative. But recent events make clear that he is actually the standard-bearer of a far more coldhearted breed. Call them the Enron Conservatives. 

Enron Conservatives are people who use political money and connections as levers to free themselves of all accountability to laws, regulations and responsibility--even to their own employees. Simply put, they are people who consistently, shamelessly and aggressively put their self-interest above the public interest. And when the lives of others are destroyed in the process, they just look the other way and hope that the law does too. And, all too often, it does. 

It probably is too much to expect the Federal Trade Commission to hop on the Enron investigation bandwagon and look into whether Bush violated truth-in-labeling laws during his campaign, when his pledges of compassionate conservatism were stump speech favorites. But it should. Because we've heard precious little of them since Bush took the oath of office. 

""While many of our citizens prosper,"" the freshly anointed president said in his inaugural address a year ago, ""others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country."" And those nagging doubts are only aggravated by the behavior of Enron executives who continue to prosper even as thousands watch their jobs--and their life's savings--disappear. 

Candidate Bush was so eager to paint himself as a Compassionate Conservative that he even dared to impugn the moral supremacy of the free market--blasphemy in the eyes of his party's doctrinaire right wing. 

""The invisible hand works many miracles,"" said Bush during the summer of 1999, evoking Adam Smith's famous paean to market forces, ""but it cannot touch the human heart."" This simple truth lies at the core of the need for fair and rational government regulation of industry. All too often, after all, the human heart is filled not with goodness but with greed, selfishness and a desire for profit at any cost. 

Too bad Bush left this noble idea on the campaign trail. Since taking office, the hallmark of his administration has been an unwavering belief in the free market's invisible hand. In the last year, the president and his anti-regulatory appointees have (take a breath): abandoned a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide; repealed workplace ergonomic rules designed to improve worker safety; proposed reversing regulations protecting 60 million acres of national forest from logging and road building; and canceled a looming deadline for auto makers to develop prototype high-mileage cars. And that's just a partial list. 

Not even the rapacious excesses of the Enron debacle have quelled the drive for deregulation--or the ardor of Enron Conservatives who champion the cause. Pat Wood, Lay's handpicked choice to head the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, insists that the collapse of Enron ""doesn't seem to be tied too much to deregulated energy markets."" You know that something is rotten in Washington when the top energy industry regulator is so unabashedly anti-regulation. 

Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, is another Enron Conservative who sees the energy giant's collapse as an aberration, not a smoking gun. He dismisses Enron's demise as ""an in-house problem"" and continues slaving away on a deregulation bill that would make Lay proud. 

Then there's Lawrence Lindsey, the president's top economic advisor and a former advisor to Enron, who went so far as to claim that the Enron disaster ""is a tribute to American capitalism."" And Sept. 11 was a tribute to Islamic ingenuity. 

Not that long ago, Bush was vowing to battle domestic suffering with ""armies of compassion."" Instead, he and his cadre of Enron Conservatives are adding to the carnage.

Cheney's closed doors

The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A.18
(Copyright 2002)

NOW THAT Enron faces a federal investigation in the wake of its largest-ever bankruptcy, it's time for Vice President Dick Cheney to explain fully his closed-door meetings with the fallen energy giant. 

After a ridiculous insistence on secrecy, Cheney acknowledges that, yes, he and his advisers met with Enron before and after writing an industry-friendly report on energy. The guest list at sessions of Cheney's energy task force was kept secret, most likely to cover the oil and gas interests who prepped the White House on what to write.

The Enron-Cheney get-togethers aren't a huge surprise. Enron and its employees gave $113,800 to the Bush presidential campaign in 2000. CEO Ken Lay was a confidant of the president, offering advice on choices for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and extolling deregulation of electricity prices in the depths of the California energy crisis. 

The result of the meetings was an energy blueprint produced by Cheney tilted heavily to more drilling, exploration and coal mining, and dismissing energy conservation. 

The repeated Enron meetings lend more substance to claims that the White House is on autopilot when it comes to energy: oil and gas interests come first, and there's no need to study any other options. Cheney's clumsy delays in acknowledging Enron's access is a reminder of the White House's tunnel vision on the topic. 

But the meetings dredge up another embarrassing matter: Did Enron hint at its collapsing finances that ended in bankruptcy last month? 

Cheney claims Enron's money troubles never came up. But given the company's insider status, it's worth pursuing further. Did the White House have advance word of the company's deepening problems that made it the largest bankruptcy in history? Thousands of angry stockholders and employees may want to know more about Enron's -- and Cheney's -- conduct.

Mysteries of the Energy Plan

For months, the White House has refused to hand over any information about the closed-door meetings of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force--a group that was heavy on energy executives, including Enron Corp. Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay. Both Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and the congressional General Accounting Office have insisted that the workings of the task force be disclosed. The White House has steadfastly maintained it is not obligated to do so. But considering the impact of the energy recommendations issued in May, from drilling for oil in Arctic wilderness to weakening the Clean Air Act, Americans should be privy to the making of these decisions. The collapse of Enron Corp., which has led to a federal criminal investigation, just bolsters the argument. 

The links between administration officials and Enron, starting with President Bush's own ties to the now-disgraced Lay, are going to get deserved scrutiny from several congressional committees. Democrats are gleeful at having such a fat target in a congressional election year. Yet the White House continues releasing too little, too late.

In a Jan. 3 letter to Waxman, White House counsel David S. Addington states that Cheney or members of his energy task force met six times with Enron executives. Once Cheney met with Lay. All of the meetings may have been perfectly innocent. But the adamant refusal of the White House to explain what took place not only creates the appearance of impropriety but also illuminates a dangerous penchant for secrecy. Whether it's keeping Congress out of the loop or preventing historians from examining past presidential papers, this is too often the administration mind-set. 

Some of Waxman's requests may be picayune. He is asking, for example, about any communication that may have taken place between Cheney and Lay at a panel discussion on energy matters held at an American Enterprise Institute forum in Colorado in June. But the bulk of Waxman's questions are not unreasonable. Given the enormity of the Enron collapse and the company's seeming role in determining U.S. energy policy, it seems fair to ask for details about the meetings, any requests for changes in federal policies by Enron executives, copies of documents presented and the names of those attending. 

The vice president's office obviously doesn't see it that way. White House counsel Addington ends his paltry letter to Waxman by saying, ""It is our hope that submission of [this] information will help you avoid the waste of time and taxpayer funds on unnecessary inquiries."" This is maximum spin. 

Both Congress and the public deserve a full accounting of the administration's dealings with Enron. The fastest way to avoid wasting time and taxpayer money is for the White House to come clean.

UK: Wall St seen inching up, Enron dives in Europe.

01/10/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

LONDON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S. shares were expected to creep higher on Thursday as investors held to the sidelines awaiting a flood of corporate earnings next week for guidance, and failed energy giant Enron Corp slid in Europe. March futures contracts pointed to a slightly firmer start on Wall Street with the Dow Jones blue-chip index up 15 points at 10,091 and the tech-laden Nasdaq rose 6.5 points to 1,662. 

Dealers at electronic brokerage Instinet said shares in Enron fell 17 percent to 65 cents in light volume from a 79 cents close after the U.S. Justice Department opened a criminal investigation of Enron, amid controversy over its collapse.

On Wednesday officials declined to say exactly when the criminal probe began. But they said it was centered in the department's criminal division and that a task force was being set up to handle the case. 

Robert Bennett, attorney for Enron, said, ""When this investigation is finished, a lot of the things that people are reading and hearing will be proven to be not true."" 

Dealers said there was very little volume in the market and they expected a wash-out day with little corporate news or economic data to determine the health of corporate America. 

""The U.S. indices tried to test their upper resistance levels and failed miserably on Wednesday. The Dow came nowhere near 10,300 and the Nasdaq almost but not quite made 2,100,"" said Tom Hougaard at Financial Spreads. 

""The punishment for this failure was severe and we closed below the lows of the days before. Technically this was a failure and should take prices even lower,"" he added. 

Elsewhere, traders in London said there were modest rises in General Electric Company , up 10 cents at $38.65, Cisco rose 15 cents and Sun Microsystems was also marginally higher. 

Dealers said they expected shares in JNI Corp to remain under pressure after the provider of enterprise storage connectivity products said on Wednesday it would report a wider-than-expected fourth quarter loss.

Enron Sees Court OK For Asset Sale Despite Objections
By Kathy Chu

01/10/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 


NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Beleaguered Enron Corp. (ENE) doesn't expect a flurry of creditor objections to significantly hurt its chances of getting court approval to sell its core energy-trading operations.

Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, is scheduled to hear Enron's motion to shed part of its crown jewels Friday. The hearing follows a competitive auction of the energy business planned for Thursday. 

""We expect the hearing to go forward,"" said Brian Rosen, of Weil, Gotshal & Manges law firm, which represents the bankrupt company. 

Once the company and its official creditors committee have agreed upon a suitor for the struggling business and submits the offer to the court, approval should follow shortly thereafter, according to Rosen. 

The sale is seen as an important step in reviving Enron's energy-trading operations, which generated about 90% of the company's $101 billion in revenue last year. Enron hopes that a creditworthy partner will take a 51% stake in the business, to be renamed New Energy Trading Co., while Enron maintains a 49% stake. 

The idea: to bring business back to what was once the nation's dominant natural gas and electricity trader. 

For their part, many of the creditors that filed objections - because of concern over which assets will be affected and what will be done with the proceeds of any sale - said it's likely they'll be able to resolve their differences with Enron ahead of or during Friday's court hearing. 

""I think that most of the concerns will be answered quickly,"" said Aaron Cahn, of Carter Ledyard & Milburn law firm, which represents a consortium of oil creditors that had requested clarification of which assets will be sold, among other requests. 

Enron has said that it expects multiple bids for the energy-trading unit's hardware and software - including its valuable online trading platform - but not for the unit's trading book, the value of which the company estimates at $5 billion to $7 billion. 

This alleviates the concerns of some creditors who were uncertain about whether the sale would affect their trading contracts with Enron. 

Also, since proceeds from the sale are likely to come in as ""future revenue stream,"" according to Weil, Gotshal's Rosen, there may not be any immediate cash to put into escrow, as Enron creditors, including Wiser Oil Co., have requested. 

If an all-cash order is received and approved by the company and its creditors' committee, then Enron will look to the court to decide how the proceeds will be handled, said Rosen. 

Whatever happens, Enron and its advisors feel the energy-business sale needs to take place as soon as possible. 

Delayed approval of the transaction could jeopardize the value of the energy-trading operations' assets, Enron has said. Also, while most of Enron North America's traders are still with the company, there's no guarantee that they'll stay indefinitely. 

If the company and its creditors committee can agree upon a suitor at Thursday's auction, then information about the bid will be forwarded to interested parties - including objecting creditors - for review before the Friday hearing. 

More than a dozen companies have expressed concern about the proposed sale, including Royal Bank of Scotland, General Electric Co.'s (GE) General Electric Corp., Eco-Tankship Inc. and El Paso Corp.'s (EP) El Paso Merchant Energy LP. 

""Many of the objections should disappear when people have more information,"" said James Beldner, an attorney for Enron retiree Michael Moran, an individual who sits on the committee and represents deferred compensation-plan holders.

Enron May Reject Contracts, Leases With 10 Days Notice

01/10/2002

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This story was originally published late Wednesday.) 


NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal bankruptcy judge is allowing Enron Corp. (ENE) to reject commercial property leases and contracts with creditors - as long as the bankrupt company gives these parties 10 business days notice.

The order, issued late Wednesday by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, came after Enron modified its original motion to give creditors more time to object before the contract is deemed terminated. 

Enron must also attempt to notify the attorneys for those parties involved, according to the judge's order. 

If creditors oppose Enron's attempt to end an agreement, they can seek a court hearing.

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

"Union Carbide - TX City offer","	
	FYI

	I'm trying to sell 10,000/d off Blk Marlin into Carbide for Nov & Dec 01.
	Jody was a pass on HSC - $0.03 because of other gas he has flowing
	which he now indicates is showing up at HSC - $0.04 to $0.05.  

	Nelson hasn't confirmed price to me but the best I've heard from him was
	a HSC - $0.04 and he wanted to better Spinniker's price.  

	Our last shot for Nov & Dec is Monday.
	After that, we have a shot at gas that comes up Jan 01 at TX City.


	Jody still wants to see a delivered price off of MOPS and he seems to 
	be expecting HSC - $0.10 to $0.12 based on gas he's buying at
	El Paso Blessing.

I have a price discrepancy with one of Stacey's deals with Texaco Natural Gas for April 2001.  It is deal 695976 for 12,000/day.  We have it priced at WAHA gas daily + 0.005 and Texaco says it should be WAHA IF + 0.005.  Rick O'Bannion, the trader at Texaco, has confirmed their price.  Can you check this for me and let me know which is correct?

Thanks,
Megan

"Tenaska IV Agency Agreement","Ed, 

ENA has acted as agent for Tenaska IV , a generation facility in Cleburne, Texas, in which , Enron has ownership interest.  Our role was to manage the fuel requirements for the plant.  This includes scheduling, invoicing, and settling the natural gas supplies and transportation.  In addition to the daily activity, ENA has the responsibility to sale any excess fuel from the baseload supplies and purchase an additional fuel needs.  Any profits/losses are passed on to Tenaska IV.  ENA is just paid a monthly fee for the service.  Rick Hill is my contact person for the project. He is looking into finding another party to handle this fuel management responsibility.  If he can't find a party willing to do this under similar terms, we will need to find some one with the Enron estate to handle this.  The problem with Enron continuing in the role is the inability to transact in the gas market (no customers willing to trade with us).  So, the project is losing value.  Please give me a call when you get a chance.  Or, maybe we can meet sometime next week to go over this.  My schedule is pretty flexible.

Judge delays order to stop shredding
FBI agents poised to enter Enron building 
Compiled from Houston Chronicle staff and wire reports

A judge prodded parties in a lawsuit against Enron Corp. today to work out a plan to halt the destruction of documents. FBI agents, meanwhile, were dispatched to Enron headquarters to investigate new allegations of document shredding. Meanwhile, federal investigators were poised to enter Enron Corp.'s Houston headquarters. 

""This is the shredded evidence that we got out of Enron,"" attorney William Lerach said as he hurried into the downtown Houston courthouse. He asked U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon to ban any shredding by Enron's former auditor, Arthur Andersen. 

Harmon did not issue an immediate ruling, instead asking plaintiffs and Andersen to discuss the problem and get back to her Wednesday. As for Enron, Lerach said he wants to depose company chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay and others about new allegations of shredding at Enron headquarters. 

Enron bankruptcy attorney Melanie Gray countered that any rulings on taking custody of Enron's own documents must come from the New York bankruptcy court handling the company's Chapter 11 filing. 

A state judge's order already prohibits Andersen's Houston office from shredding Enron-related documents. Chicago-based Andersen acknowledged earlier this month its Houston office had destroyed a significant but undetermined amount of audit-related work. 

While attorneys argued in court, FBI agents were preparing to ender Enron's 50-story headquarters building to look into the latest allegations of shredding. 

""We proactively offered our full cooperation in any investigation the Department of Justice might wish to conduct and we believe such an investigation is properly done by federal authorities, not plaintiffs' counsel for benefit of a lawsuit,"" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 

A former Enron Corp. executive said Monday she witnessed the mass shredding of financial documents at the energy company's accounting office, a practice that began around Thanksgiving and continued through at least last week. 

Maureen Castaneda, Enron's former director of foreign exchange, has turned over to a lawyer several boxes containing mounds of shredded documents dated from November and December. The shreds reveal words that refer to Enron's off-the-books business ventures, the partnerships that led to the company's collapse. 

In an ABC-TV interview that aired Monday night, Castaneda said that around Thanksgiving she saw several boxes of papers being pulled from storage areas and then shredded, despite a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation that had begun the month before. 

Castaneda said the shredding continued through her final day on the job last week and that she used paper-filled boxes she found in the hallway to pack her belongings. She could not be reached for comment by the Chronicle after the ABC broadcast. 

Enron spokesman Palmer, however, said that company officials had directed employees when the SEC investigation began to retain all documents, to destroy nothing. 

""We don't know the significance nor the pertinence of the documents that the plaintiffs' lawyers are parading in front of the media,"" Palmer said Monday. 

""But we do know what we have been telling employees sinceOct. 25. We have told them repeatedly that they are to retain all documents or materials related to Enron transactions, statements to the public and investors, handwritten notes -- in short, any method of information recording."" 

The company issued four directives via e-mail about the document retention, Palmer said. An Oct. 25 e-mail warned employees: ""You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions."" 

Lerach is representing New York-based Amalgamated Bank in a lawsuit against Enron executives. He said Monday he would seek the restraining order in federal court today to prevent the destruction of any other evidence. 

Amalgamated Bank, which manages pension funds that hold Enron stock, sued in November, alleging that Enron executives and board members sold $1.1 billion in Enron stock during the past three years while not disclosing that the stock price was overvalued. 

Lerach said that while he knows of several former Enron employees who saw the shredding, Castaneda was the only one who has come forward. 

""From what we have learned, destruction of evidence at Enron was open and notorious and widespread,"" Lerach said. ""They even shredded on Christmas Day."" 

He said he will have the shredded files in court today. 

""We believe the Enron employees were destroying documents at the same time Andersen people did,"" said Lerach, referring to Enron's former auditor. ""The question of whether there was a coordinated effort is something to look into."" 

In Washington, investigators pushed for public testimony from former Arthur Andersen auditor David Duncan, fired last week after the company said he ordered the destruction of Enron documents last fall. 

Duncan since has cooperated with investigators, telling them that Andersen executives had plenty of information to evaluate Enron's controversial use of offshore partnerships. 

The partnerships allowed Enron to hide millions of dollars of debt for years and mislead investors and its employees about Enron's financial health. 

Duncan ""did not sit there and say, `Enron hid all this information from us and therefore we couldn't count right,' "" Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., who heads the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, told The Associated Press. ""It was more of ... `we made mistakes.'"" 

Greenwood, speaking about comments Duncan made to lawmakers last week, said that rather than a mea culpa, Duncan gave ""a wea culpa; he did not point the finger at Enron."" 

Duncan is scheduled to testify before Greenwood's panel Thursday, one day after lawmakers return to Capitol Hill from their winter break. Duncan's lawyers had tried to delay his testimony, saying he needs more time to prepare, but Greenwood rejected the request, threatening to subpoena Duncan if necessary. 

Duncan ""doesn't really need to recall every detail of what he did for Enron,"" Greenwood told the AP. ""We're focused on the destruction of documents."" 

Enron and Arthur Andersen have come under fire in the wake of the Houston company's implosion last year. Once the world's largest energy trading company, Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, costing thousands of employees their jobs and their retirement nest eggs, much of which were tied up in now virtually worthless company stock. 

At least nine congressional investigations are under way, as are probes by the Labor Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, which is looking into possible criminal violations. 

In addition to the congressional investigations, lawmakers also will turn their attention to legislation aimed at preventing a another debacle like Enron. 

On Monday, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she will introduce a bill this week ensuring that auditors remain independent from the companies they audit. 

The bill comes in the wake of revelations that Andersen received $52 million in annual business from Enron, about half of it from its auditing account and half in consulting fees. 

Joseph Berardino, chief executive officer of Andersen, has dismissed concerns that his company overlooked Enron's accounting practices to preserve other business with the company. 

However, appearing on NBC-TV's Meet the Press over the weekend, Berardino said Andersen is considering whether to end its consulting services and focus on its auditing business. 

Also on the congressional agenda in the coming months will be legislation that Boxer sponsored with Sen. Jon Corzine, D-N.J., to protect employee retirement accounts. 

The Boxer-Corzine Pension Protection and Diversification Act, introduced last month, encourages workers to diversify retirement investment plans by limiting to 20 percent the investment an employee can have in any one stock in his 401(k). 

The bill also would allow employees who receive their own company's stock as part of their employer's matching contribution to their retirement savings plan to sell the stock 90 days after it arrives in their accounts. 

In Enron's case, employees were not allowed to sell matching stock until age 50.

Judge Delays Deciding Possession Of Andersen-Enron Info
By Michael Rieke

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- A federal judge Tuesday put off for 24 hours a decision on taking possession of Arthur Andersen documents relating to the firm's accounting and auditing work for failed energy giant, Enron Corp. (ENRNQ).
U.S. District Court Judge Melinda Harmon told plaintiff attorneys and attorneys for Andersen to try to agree on a plan for the preservation and protection of the documents, otherwise she will make her own decision. 
Ken Marks, an attorney representing Enron, told the court that the company called the Department of Justice Monday evening after learning of allegations that Enron documents have been shredded. The Justice Department has dispatched agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to secure documents at Enron and to interview Enron employees about possible destruction of evidence. 
Melanie Grey, appointed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York to represent Enron in its bankruptcy filing, objected to Judge Harmon issuing an order concerning documents related to that case. Such an order needs to come from the bankruptcy court, she said. 

Nearly 50 attorneys gathered in the Houston courtroom Tuesday to tell Judge Harmon their opinions on preserving and protecting Andersen documents related to civil suits filed by investors who lost hundreds of millions of dollars through Enron stocks and bonds. 
Bill Lerach, representing the Regents of the University of California and Amalgamated Bank, said Andersen can no longer be trusted with evidence in the Enron case. 
As a result of its work for Waste Management Inc., Andersen last year was hit by the biggest fine ever levied by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Lerach said. 
Judge Harmon presided over a class-action lawsuit brought against Waste Management by some of its investors. 
The accounting firm was also enjoined last June from ever again violating federal securities laws because of its work for Waste Management, Lerach said. Still, Andersen admitted last month that some of its employees had shredded documents relating to the Enron account. 
Andersen employees involved in the Waste Management case attended a meeting last January when Andersen executives in Houston and the firm's Chicago headquarters discussed dropping Enron as a client because of possible accounting problems. The firm decided at that time to stick with Enron. 
Lerach also displayed a box overflowing with strips of paper, which he said were documents shredded recently by Enron employees. The shredding by Anderson and Enron weren't separate occurrences, but were done with joint knowledge by the two companies, he said. 
He called for all Andersen documents to be impounded by the judge and guarded by U.S. marshals. He also asked the judge to appoint experts who could oversee recovery of any e-mails or other electronic evidence that had been deleted by Andersen.

FBI investigating new allegations of Enron file shredding; judge hears request on documents
By KRISTEN HAYS

HOUSTON (AP) - A judge prodded parties in a lawsuit against Enron Corp. on Tuesday to work out a plan to halt the destruction of documents. FBI agents, meanwhile, were dispatched to Enron headquarters to investigate new allegations of document shredding. 
""This is the shredded evidence that we got out of Enron,"" attorney William Lerach said as he carried a box of paper shreds into the courthouse.
The hearing before U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon was primarily on a previous request to ban any shredding by Enron's former auditor, Arthur Andersen. 
She asked plaintiffs and Andersen to discuss the problem and get back to her Wednesday. As for Enron, Lerach said he wants to take depositions from company chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay and others about the allegations made public Monday of shredding at the company. 
Enron bankruptcy attorney Melanie Gray argued that any rulings on taking custody of Enron's own documents must come from the New York bankruptcy court handling the company's Chapter 11 filing. 
FBI agents were inside Enron's 50-story headquarters building Tuesday morning looking into the latest allegations accusing Enron employees themselves, not just Andersen, of destroying documents. Company spokesman Mark Palmer said they were on site at the request of attorneys for the collapsed energy trading company. 
""We proactively offered our full cooperation in any investigation the Department of Justice might wish to conduct,"" Palmer said. He said the company thinks ""such an investigation is properly done by federal authorities, not plaintiffs' counsel for benefit of a lawsuit."" 
Lerach represents shareholders suing 29 current and former Enron executives and directors. 
A state judge's order already prohibits Andersen's Houston office from shredding Enron-related documents. Chicago-based Andersen acknowledged earlier this month its Houston office had destroyed a significant but undetermined amount of audit-related work.

FBI searching Enron offices
Reports of shredding prompt agents' move in Houston

By Allen Wan, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 1:47 PM ET Jan. 22, 2002
HOUSTON (CBS.MW) - FBI agents are combing Enron's Houston office for evidence of possible document shredding. 
The news comes a day after day after former employees alleged the now-bankrupt energy trader continued to shred boxes of documents this month despite federal subpoenas and court orders issued back in October forbidding the practice. 
Enron rebutted the claim.
Meanwhile, a federal judge in Houston will hear a request for expedited discovery into Andersen's role in the document shredding. Andersen was Enron's longtime auditor. 
A congressional subcommittee will hold a hearing Thursday into the destruction of Enron-related documents by Andersen personnel.
Shares of Enron slid nearly 20 percent to 41 cents in recent action. 
On Monday, Maureen Castaneda, the former director of Enron's foreign investments section, told ABC News in an interview that the shredding of documents began after Thanksgiving on the 19th floor in an accounting office and continued through at least early January. 
""I left the second week of January, and the shredding was going on until the day I left, and I have no idea if it continues,"" said Castaneda. 
""After Thanksgiving, there was great interest in the accounting documents stored,"" she said. ""They pulled out all the boxes, and people had to go through every box."" 
During the report, Castaneda showed shredded documents containing the word ""Jedi,"" which is believed to be one of the entities involved in the secret, off-the-books partnerships that kept hundreds of millions of dollars in Enron debt off its balance sheet for several years. 
Enron issued a statement late Monday in reaction to the report, saying that employees had been warned in four separate emails from Oct. 25 through Jan. 14 to preserve all documents and materials. 
The SEC began investigating Enron in mid-October, the Associated Press reported.
""Enron's communications with its employees were very clear on the destruction of documents, and any breach of the company's policy will be dealt with swiftly and severely,"" the company said in the statement. 
""Enron has been cooperating fully with congressional investigators and handed over to various government investigators 41 boxes of documents and materials.""
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer confirmed that an internal investigation was under way to determine whether employees had ignored the warning. 
""We don't know the significance or even pertinence of the materials that were said to have been shredded,"" he said. ""All we know is what we told employees.""
At least 10 congressional committees and the Department of Justice are also investigating Enron's meltdown and Andersen's role as auditor for the formerly highflying energy trader.
Andersen, one of the Big Five accounting firms, has admitted to destroying documents related to Enron's finances and fired the partner who was its lead auditor of Enron books.

Enron Document Shredding to Be Probed by Justice, SEC

By Jef Feeley 
Houston, Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The federal government is expanding its criminal and civil investigations into the collapse of Enron Corp. by looking into the shredding of documents at the energy trader. 
Enron workers were shredding documents in an accounting office at the company's Houston headquarters as recently as two weeks ago, a former Enron executive, Maureen Castaneda, told ABC News. Both the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating Enron-related matters for about three months. 
Both agencies already had been investigating document shredding at Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, in October and November. At least 10 congressional committees also are looking into Enron matters, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee has asked Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino to testify about the document destruction on Thursday. 
``The shredding is over'' at Arthur Andersen, Rusty Hardin, a lawyer for the accounting firm, said in court today in Houston. ``What was done by some people was a mistake in judgment.'' He said Andersen is cooperating with the federal investigation. 
The Justice Department inquiry into the new allegations was disclosed in Houston federal court by Enron lawyer Ken Marks. He said company officials discovered a bag of shredded documents at its Houston headquarters. Lawyers for shareholders suing the company sought a court order today to prevent more shredding. 
FBI Presence 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation sent agents to Enron's headquarters today to interview employees about the shredding, Marks said. The company put security guards on the 19th floor of its headquarters last night after hearing of the ABC report. Access to the floor is closed and the area is being checked for evidence of shredding, he said. 
William Lerach, a lawyer representing shareholders suing Enron, said the presence of FBI agents may make a court order to protect documents superfluous. 
``I'd be surprised if there is any more shredding,'' he told reporters outside the courthouse in Houston. 
Lerach, without mentioning names, said he expects ``other institutions and firms are going to be named as defendants'' in the shareholders' suit. 
Enron's outside law firm, Vinson & Elkins, is under investigation by congressional committees for its role in advising the energy trader. The firm conducted an internal investigation into claims made in August by an employee who said accounting irregularities threatened Enron. 
Obstruction 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's expanded role was disclosed by SEC Enforcement Director Stephen Cutler. 
``To the extent there was or is document destruction going on elsewhere, including Enron, that would come within the scope of our investigation as well,'' Cutler told a news conference today. 
Destroying documents that might be sought in an investigation that has already begun might constitute obstruction of justice, white-collar defense lawyers have said. 
Castaneda, a former director of Enron's foreign investments section, described her activities in the ABC interview. 
``I left the second week of January and the shredding was going on until the day I left,'' she said. She showed the network boxes of the shredded documents, some of which had the word ``confidential'' on them. 
Two other employees also saw trash bags full of shredded documents in the same vicinity of the office in November, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
Enron is investigating the shredding, company attorney Robert Bennett told the Journal. Enron said it has told employees ``in no uncertain terms'' since Oct. 25 to preserve all documents related to company partnerships. Four e-mails to that effect were sent to workers from Oct. 25 to Jan. 14, the company statement said. 
Enron will take ``swift action'' against any employee who shredded documents, said company spokesman Mark Palmer. 
Shareholder Suits 
Enron shareholders are suing the company, once the world's No. 1 energy trader, and Arthur Andersen, the fifth largest U.S. accounting firm. The suit claims that Enron and its accountants hid some $600 million in losses from investors, triggering the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
The Justice Department and FBI declined to comment about the investigation. 
Arthur Andersen last week fired David Duncan, a Houston partner who supervised the Enron audit, for destroying documents. Duncan said he was following directions from a senior lawyer at Andersen's Chicago headquarters, a claim denied by the accounting firm. 
``There may be an innocent explanation for some of the shredding,'' said Andersen's Hardin. ``There may not be'' for other instances. ``Arthur Andersen has not intentionally violated the law.'' 
Arthur Andersen kept about 150 employees at Enron's headquarters to handle the account. More than half of its $52 million in Enron-related fees last year came from consulting and other non-audit work. Accounting experts and lawmakers say the risk of losing business may make an auditor reluctant to confront a client about accounting irregularities. 
Andersen handled internal auditing at Enron from 1994 through 1998, a service some industry experts said may pose a conflict of interest because the accounting firm's also was the external auditor. 

FBI Securing Rest Of Enron Documents 
Enron Accused Of Shredding Documents
Posted: 7:53 a.m. CST January 22, 2002
Updated: 1:33 p.m. CST January 22, 2002
KPRC, Channel 2, Houston
HOUSTON -- FBI agents moved into the Enron Corp. building in downtown Tuesday, conducting an investigation into allegations of new shredding of documents. 
Details of the new shredding were announced late Monday in Houston by some lawyers suing on behalf of investors. 
One of the attorneys, William Lerach, said that document shredding went on long after federal regulators began investigating the energy company's collapse. 
""I think we may have stumbled upon an attempt to destroy critical evidence in one of the largest financial frauds in the history of our nation,"" Lerach said. 
He said ""hundreds of thousands"" of documents were destroyed at Enron's Houston headquarters -- as recently as Jan. 14. 
Lerach brought a box of shredded documents into a federal courthouse in Houston on Tuesday. 
He asked a judge to ban any shredding by Enron or by its former auditor, the accounting firm Andersen. 
Earlier this month, Andersen acknowledged that its Houston office had destroyed a significant number of documents. 
Former Enron executive Maureen Castaneda said that she saw staffers in Enron's accounting and finance departments review and shred thousands of documents. She said it started when the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a formal investigation. 
Castaneda told morning talk shows Tuesday that the shredding began after Thanksgiving at the accounting office of the company's Houston headquarters -- and continued at least until the middle of this month. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission began looking into Enron in mid-October when the company announced huge losses. Enron filed for bankruptcy in December. 
An attorney representing Enron said the energy company is investigating the matter. The company said it repeatedly warned employees not to destroy documents. 
The Houston-based business was the nation's seventh-biggest company in revenue. Enron's downfall has hurt both individual investors and big pension funds around the country. 
Enron Manager Fired For Computer Use
An Enron manager said he deserved to be fired. 
Clayton Vernon told The New York Times he was fired for posting a message online that criticized Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay as ""the sorriest sack of garbage I have ever been associated with."" 
Vernon was at work when he posted the message using an Enron computer. He said he knew that violated company policy prohibiting personal use of computers. 

In a September in-house online chat, Vernon questioned Lay about the company's accounting practices. Lay disagreed when Vernon suggested the company was sacrificing its future for the sake of present earnings. 

Vernon is suing Enron over its business practices. 
Congressional Hearings Begin Later This Week
The first of what will be many hearings into Enron's collapse is set for Thursday. 

The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee wants to know whether federal regulators did all they could to protect investors and businesses hurt by the largest bankruptcy ever in American history. 

Over at the Senate Finance Committee, they're looking into whether Enron used tax shelters to mask its financial condition. 

A subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee also has scheduled a hearing for Thursday. The tentative witness list includes top officials from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen and David Duncan, the Andersen auditor fired last week. 

The full committee hopes to hear testimony early next month from Lay and other company officials. 
It is looking into whether Enron improperly blocked its employees from selling the Enron stock in their retirement plans.

Enron still shredding 

January 22, 2002: 11:35 a.m. ET

Former exec: Document destruction continued after subpoenas issued. 

NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Ex-Enron employees are saying that possibly important documents were shredded as recently as last week at the energy trader's headquarters in Houston.

The shredding continued despite federal subpoenas and court orders since late October forbidding the practice, a former executive for the bankrupt company said Monday.

Houston-based Enron has also allowed the Federal Bureau of Investigation to interview workers located on the 19th and 20th floor of the energy trader's headquarters.

Plaintiff attorneys are asking a federal judge to assign a U.S. marshal or security team inside the building to ensure no more documents are destroyed. An initial search of the 19th floor revealed one wastebasket with shredded documents in that have been turned over to authorities.

Maureen Castaneda, who served as director of international investment for Enron, told CNNfn Tuesday morning that she took some of the shredded documents home to use as packing material before she realized what the paper contained. ""I thought, well, wait a minute -- if there's threatening legal suits, why are there still shredded documents?"" she said. 

The Wall Street Journal said Tuesday that at least two other employees said the documents shredded at Enron appear to relate to controversial partnerships used to hide debt, and that Enron's counsel said it was investigating.

Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company has repeatedly told employees to preserve documents. 


Other recent developments

Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, the biggest Chapter 11 filing in the history of the United States. Since then the energy company has become the subject of a criminal investigation by government regulators and other shareholder lawsuits. Recent developments include:


?  Another executive of Andersen LLP testified last week that the firm's Houston office began destroying documents after receiving an e-mail from Andersen's head office.
Michael Odom, the risk management partner responsible for the Houston office, gave testimony Friday that bolstered the account given by lead partner David Duncan last week, sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN/Money.

Odom's testimony amplifies the finger-pointing between Duncan and Andersen over who initiated the destruction of auditing documents considered vital to the investigation of Enron's bankruptcy. Details <http://money.cnn.com/2002/01/21/companies/enron_odom/>

?  Arthur Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino conceded Sunday that his company made errors but said that the energy company's demise was ultimately the result of a failed business model, not shady accounting.  ""At its base, this is an economic failure,"" said Andersen Chief Executive Officer Joseph Berardino on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

?  In a telephone interview with the New York Times, the attorney for Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay said his client repeatedly used shares of the company as collateral for other investments that he would not specify. Attorney Earl J. Silbert said Lay's decision to sell shares of Enron late last year reflected concern about the loans, and was not tied to warnings from a company vice president about Enron's financial situation.

?  Responding to severe market criticism of how it handled now-bankrupt Enron's ratings, Moody's Investors Service says it is considering making changes in how it rates companies.
The review by one of the three leading U.S. credit rating agencies -- the others are Standard & Poor's and Fitch -- follows criticism of the agencies' perceived lack of speed in downgrading energy trader Enron's ratings to junk status in November.

?  Weeks before his company filed for the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, Lay touted the energy trader's stock as an ""incredible bargain"" in a Web chat with his employees.
In a transcript of the in-house chat session, which took place Sept. 26, the Enron CEO also defended Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm recently accused of destroying key documents and covering up sizable financial losses.


FBI investigates Enron shredding 
Former employee Maureen Castaneda tells CNBC forms were shredded just last week

MSNBC STAFF AND WIRE REPORTS

WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 -  The FBI entered Enron's Houston headquarters to look for evidence that the troubled energy firm shredded financial information up to two weeks ago. Maureen Castaneda, a former employee of Enron, told CNBC on Tuesday that shredding took place into last week. Additionally, lawyers suing Enron have asked a court to step in to prevent more tampering.

       ""WE CAN CONFIRM that Department of Justice and FBI personnel are on site, conducting an investigation into the allegations raised last night,"" company spokesman Vance Meyer told Reuters.
       A former Enron employee, Maureen Castaneda, told CNBC television on Monday that documents were shredded in the Enron building up until her departure from the company in the second week of January, despite court orders forbidding the destruction of documents.
       ""It was a major accounting fraud and now they have been caught destroying the evidence,"" Lerach said Tuesday on NBC's ""Today."" ""I'd say they've got trouble on their hands."" (MSNBC is a Microsoft-NBC joint venture.)
       Robert Bennett, a Washington lawyer representing Enron, said the company told employees after coming under investigation that they were not to destroy relevant documents. He said the company is looking into charges papers were destroyed despite that directive.
       Lerach said the shredding was ""open and notorious and widespread,"" consuming ""hundreds of thousands of documents."" 

       Lerach was bringing some of the shredded documents to federal court Tuesday to seek court custody of relevant Enron papers, as part of a class-action lawsuit against the company by aggrieved investors.
       ""We're going to ask the court to take extraordinary measures ... to prevent any further tampering or destruction,"" he said on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""
       ""It may be necessary that we put a U.S. marshal or someone on the premises.""
       The reported shredding follows revelations over the past two weeks about document destruction at Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor. 

Another attorney in the lawsuit, G. Paul Howes, said in court papers that some of papers destroyed at Enron headquarters were marked Jedi II and Chewco - partnerships through which the energy giant concealed hundreds of millions of dollars in debts.
       The partnerships, described by lawmakers as slick financial gimmicks, helped drive the company into the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.
       The Securities and Exchange Commission began looking into Enron's accounting practices in mid-October, after the company reported more than $600 million in third-quarter losses, and a congressional committee began asking for documents in mid-December. The SEC opened a formal investigation at the end of October, including demands for financial documents from Enron and Andersen.
       Enron said in a statement late Monday that it had issued four e-mails from Oct. 25 to Jan. 14 warning employees against destroying documents, specifically those related to Enron's complex web of partnerships. 

Andersen exec denies coverup

       ""We are investigating the circumstances of the reported destruction of documents,"" Bennett said.

       Bennett said anyone who violated directives against destroying documents ""will be dealt with appropriately.""
       Castaneda, who was laid off last week, said she did not know who ordered employees to do the shredding. ""I think they were just doing what they were told,"" she said.
       She said she brought shredded paper home to use as packing material.
       The Justice Department announced on Jan. 9 that it was pursuing a criminal investigation of Enron, which entered the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2 following a six-week downward spiral.
       Andersen last week fired its lead Enron auditor for destroying Enron-related documents. The auditor, David Duncan, has told congressional investigators he was just following the advice of Andersen's legal department when he directed the shredding. 

       Lawyers for Duncan have been seeking to delay his public testimony, scheduled for Thursday before the investigative panel of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, saying Duncan needs more time to prepare.
       But Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., the subcommittee's chairman, rejected the request, arguing that Duncan ""doesn't really need to recall every detail of what he did for Enron. We're focused on the destruction of documents. We'll subpoena him if we have to.""
       Said Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee: ""This whole sorry affair keeps getting uglier by the minute, and we're determined to get to the bottom of it. ... Making bad business decisions is one thing, but trying to cover up bad business decisions is another."" 

       Meanwhile, a lawyer for Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said Lay disposed of millions of dollars in Enron stock before the company's collapse last year because he needed to raise cash to repay loans, not because of concerns about the health of his company.
       Attorney Earl J. Silbert said Monday Lay had put up shares of his Enron stock as collateral for other investments. On at least 15 occasions between February and October last year, Lay returned shares to the company to repay $4 million he had received through a credit line.
       However, Silbert also said that Lay held onto some stock, detailing one transaction in which Lay exercised options to purchase 68,000 shares of Enron stock on Aug. 21.
       ""He continues to hold that stock today,"" Silbert said. 

       In other developments:

   The State Department disclosed that Secretary of State Colin Powell referred to Enron's problems regarding a power plant in India in a discussion with India's foreign minister last April 6. Enron was trying to collect a $64 million debt on the project. According to the State Department, Powell said failure to resolve the matter could have a serious deterrent effect on other investors.

   New Jersey's two U.S. senators, Democrats Robert Torricelli and Jon Corzine, urged the federal government to inspect Enron's natural gas pipelines to ensure against accidents. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said ""our pipelines are inspected continuously and the hardworking men and women who have devoted their lives to the safe operations of these pipelines would have it no other way.""

   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said accounting firms should be barred from providing management consulting services to the companies they audit. ""These conflicts have led to the kind of hide-the-debt shell game that took place at Enron,"" said Boxer, who will introduce a bill to ban the dual role.

   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader said a special counsel should investigate Enron rather than the Justice Department's criminal division. Nader also said Bush administration officials should have alerted the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission last fall when contacted by Enron Chairman Ken Lay about the company's growing problems.

Congress targets Enron fallout

By Matt Andrejczak, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 9:21 AM ET Jan. 22, 2002

WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) - The dramatic collapse of Enron and the resulting steady drumbeat of headlines last week will give lawmakers plenty to chew on when Congress returns to session on Wednesday.
News came out at a blistering pace: ""Enron employee warned Lay""-- ""Andersen fires lead auditor"" -- ""SEC unveils plan to police auditors"" -- ""Enron fires Andersen, blame game ensues -- ""White House denies Enron links.""
Ten congressional committees are investigating the impact of Enron's bankruptcy -- the largest in U.S. history. The probes range from accounting and investor protection issues to tax shelters to pension rules to federal agency accountability. 
It comes as many in Congress are attempting to distance themselves from Enron -- a big contributor to President Bush and both political parties -- and Andersen, the Big 5 accounting firm whose long-term survival is in doubt.
Both companies have become a political liability. 
A growing number of lawmakers have pledged to return their campaign donations from both companies to avoid any appearance of impropriety, especially since this year is an election year. The entire House and one-third of the Senate are up for grabs. 
When Enron flopped, Congress rushed to ask: How could the nation's seventh largest company sink in a matter of weeks? How could we have prevented it? Where were the regulators? Should we strengthen investor protection and 401 (k) laws? How can we avoid the same disaster? 
Hearings kick off early
A fresh round of hearings will begin Thursday on both sides of the Capitol. 
The House Energy and Commerce's Oversight and Investigations subcommittee will discuss the destruction of Enron-related documents by Andersen personnel. A witness list has yet to be issued.
Also, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. The panel is largely investigating whether government agencies could have prevented the Enron meltdown. 
Its focus is on the Securities and Exchange Commission; Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; Commodity Futures Trading Commission; and the Labor Department.
Meantime, the committee's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is probing the actions of Enron's board and audit committee and its accountants. It issued 51 subpoenas earlier this month.
Congressional calls for Enron CEO Kenneth Lay to appear on Capitol Hill in early and mid-December were shot down due to the company's bankruptcy proceedings. 
Last week the release of internal memos by congressional investigators shed some light on what Lay knew and when he knew it. 
Lay makes his first appearance
As it stands, the Senate Commerce Committee -- headed by Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C. -- will get the first crack at Lay on Feb. 4. 
What about former Enron finance chiefs Jeffrey Skilling and Andrew Fastow? That is still unclear. 
They were also no-shows at the committee's Dec. 18 hearing, where former Enron employees detailed how their retirement savings were wiped out due to the company's sudden collapse.
The bigger and more looming question is if Lay will request to testify before Congress using ""limited immunity."" 
If granted, the Justice Department won't be able to use Lay's testimony against him in their criminal investigation.
Retired Marine lieutenant colonel Oliver North escaped prosecution in the Iran/Contra scandal due to limited immunity. 
So far, Lay has not requested immunity, according to Senate Commerce spokesman Nu Wexler. 
The House Financial Services Committee is also gunning for Lay, who may possibly appear before the panel on Feb. 4 as well. It doesn't plan to offer Lay limited immunity.
""We don't anticipate we would do so,"" said House Financial Services spokeswoman Peggy Peterson. ""It [limited immunity] could impede the Justice Department's investigation or others.""
And still more
On Jan. 29, the Senate Energy Committee will explore the impact of Enron's bankruptcy on consumers and the energy markets. 
The Senate Banking Committee will step into the fold on Feb. 12.
Some of its members told the SEC two years ago to back down from a proposal to strengthen auditor independence rules designed to eliminate potential conflicts of interest that sparked Enron's crazy spiral.
And they will be the same ones pondering if tougher accounting and investor protection rules need to be drafted following the Enron debacle. Such senators include Rick Santorum, R-Pa., Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Robert Bennett, R-Utah, and Phil Gramm, R-Tex., whose wife Wendy, served on Enron's board.
Set to appear before the committee are five former chairmen of the SEC: Roderick Hills (1975-1977); Harold Williams (1977-1981); David Ruder (1987-1989); Richard Breeden (1989-1993); and Arthur Levitt, the target of criticism from the committee for his auditor independence proposal.
The SEC eventually passed a watered down version of its original auditor independence rule November 2000.
One committee member, Sen. Jon Corzine, D-N.J., will certainly take aim at the SEC's recently unveiled plan to police the accounting industry. The former Goldman Sachs partner is calling for more direct SEC oversight, rather than a new private sector entity.
""At the end of the day, a private sector organization will be largely dependent on the accounting industry for its survival. That is unacceptable,"" Corzine said. ""We shouldn't rely on the fox to guard the hen house. It's time for the SEC to assume this responsibility.""
This month Senate Banking Chairman Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., requested that the General Accounting Office evaluate investing employee retirement funds in company stock and the adequacy of financial reporting in the United States.

Funds Set Up For Ex-Enron Employees
Senator Donates $60,000
Posted: 3:10 p.m. CST January 21, 2002
Updated: 3:17 p.m. CST January 21, 2002
KPRC, Channel 2, Houston
HOUSTON - A fund was announced Monday to provide assistance to former Enron employees. 
The ""Enron Ex-Employee Relief Fund Account"" <http://www.eerfa.com> will help workers who lost their jobs between Nov. 15, 2001, and Dec. 31, 2001, because of Enron's bankruptcy, according to organizers. 
Those interested in making a donation can send it to: 
Humble Community Bank 
1515 FM 1960 Bypass East 
Humble, TX 77338 
Account Name: E.E.R.F.A. 
Call the bank at (281) 540-1414 or organizers at (713) 858-5523 for more information. E-mail inquiries can be made at eerfarequest@surmk.com <mailto:eerfarequest@surmk.com>. 
The account was the brainchild of Rebekah Rushing, an Enron employee who was laid off last month but quickly had two job offers. 
Now working for a Houston oil and gas exploration company, she, with the help of other former Enron workers, established a fund to help those who are less fortunate. 
""I could have easily said, 'Somebody else can do it,'"" Rushing said. ""Things worked out for me. I want them to work out for everyone else."" 
So Rushing set up a bank account where donations are being accepted to help former Enron workers with paying everything from rent to buying groceries. 
At first, donations were slow to trickle in so Rushing wasn't able to assist any of the 10 people who requested help. 
Then, on Friday, a check for $68,857 arrived from New York Sen. Charles Schumer and another $1,000 arrived from a Wisconsin politician. Both wanted to return their Enron contributions. 
""I don't really think there has been much focus on the worker bees behind the scenes,"" Rushing said of those she hopes to help with the donations. ""There are so many people who weren't at the management level, who didn't make that much money."" 
Among those requesting help from the Enron Ex-Employee Relief Fund Account is Nathan Childs, who has stopped saying things can't get worse since being laid off on Dec. 5. 
""We're saying now, 'It can't get much worse,'"" he said, explaining that six days after he received his walking papers from Enron, his wife was hospitalized for an emergency Caesarean section; the day after Christmas his 15-month-old son was hospitalized with a respiratory virus and then in early January his 29-year-old wife suffered two strokes three days apart. 
""After everything (that) has happened to me and my family over the last month, I have become a very humbled man,"" he said. ""I had to ask for the help."" 
To make the money from his severance check stretch, Childs, who worked for Enron 1 ? years in the company's information technology hardware department, has moved his family into a travel trailer on his parents' property in Kempner, in Central Texas. They used to live in an 1,800-square-foot Houston townhouse. 
""It just makes you appreciate the little things more,"" he said. ""I'm 36 and starting all over again. It's been very tough."" 
Rushing hopes to help by providing gift certificates for groceries or checks made out to ex-employees' mortgage companies or utility providers. 
There is a $2,000 cap per former employee and Rushing is working with Enron to verify that each person who requests assistance worked for the company. 
Democratic New Hampshire state Sen. Beverly Hollingworth said after checking out the relief fund she decided to send her check for $200, returning a contribution she received from the failed energy giant. 
""We felt it was appropriate to send them a donation,"" she said. ""I don't feel my name is in any kind of jeopardy. I felt there was a need there and therefore, I sent them a check."" 
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, felt similarly. She announced Thursday that she is sending back $100,000 in donations she received from Enron and its employees to a fund set up by the Greater Houston Community Foundation <http://www.ghcf.org>. 
""I just couldn't in good conscience sit there with that kind of money and know what heartache people are feeling,"" she said. ""I think people in the community are going to want to be helpful as well."" 
Emelda Douglas, director of donor services for the foundation, said that until this week, the organization had ""great ideas"" but no funding. 
""Since Wednesday, all of the sudden, someone has discovered our idea and is willing to fund it,"" she said. 
Douglas said the foundation hopes to set up a resource office for former Enron employees with the donations it receives. At the office, those seeking jobs could access resume tips, counseling and help finding services for which they may be eligible. 
""Most of these people have always been gainfully employed and have not taken advantage of the social services that are out there,"" she said. ""What we envision initially is a place or an office where people can come and lay out all their issues. We know that it is more than financial. Ultimately, the idea would be to assist them in becoming gainfully employed again."" 

Enron Fired Workers for Complaining Online
By ALEX BERENSON, New York Times, 01/21/02

The Enron Corporation fired at least two employees in the last two months for posting information or negative opinions about it on Internet message boards.
One of the fired employees, Clayton Vernon, had asked Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, during an earlier internal online discussion whether Enron had used aggressive accounting to overstate its profits. It is unclear whether Mr. Vernon's question to Mr. Lay, which came in September, two months before he was dismissed, played any role in his firing. But a coarsely worded message critical of Mr. Lay that Mr. Vernon posted in November under a screen alias was traced back to him in less than a day.
The second fired employee, according to Enron, was the person who revealed in early December on the Internet that Enron had paid $55 million in retention bonuses to top managers and executives just before it filed for bankruptcy protection and laid off 4,000 workers on Dec. 2. The bonuses were sharply criticized by Enron employees, many of whom had their retirement savings wiped out by Enron's collapse. Enron declined to identify the second fired employee.
Enron also declined to comment on any other details of the two firings, and it would not say whether it had dismissed any other employees because of Internet postings. Mr. Vernon confirmed that he had been fired for postings that the company viewed as offensive.
""We're not going to discuss internal security actions,"" said Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron. ""But we will say that we will protect very vigorously the corporation's property.""
Both firings involved material posted in an online forum about Enron on Yahoo, whose message boards are among the most heavily used on the Internet.
It was not clear how Enron identified the employees behind the postings. People who post messages on Yahoo often believe that they cannot be traced if they do not use their real names. But many companies have the technical means to track the online activities of employees who use company computers and servers. 
In addition, Yahoo's privacy policy allows it to disclose personal information about people who post messages that it deems abusive or ""invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable,"" or that reveals confidential corporate data.
Even so, a Yahoo spokeswoman said Yahoo had not given Enron any information about anyone who posted a message. Despite the disclaimer in its privacy policy, she said, Yahoo generally divulges personal information about users only in response to a court order.
In any case, Enron apparently had little difficulty finding Mr. Vernon, who posted most of his messages from the company's Houston headquarters, where he worked designing computer-based models to estimate the value of Enron's energy trades.
A native of Midland, Tex., who describes himself as a political progressive, Mr. Vernon said that when he joined Enron in December 1999, he hoped that the company would be diverse and a meritocracy.
But in the course of two years working at Enron, he said, he ""realized it was just another Houston, Texas, corrupt thing - that we grow in this town - where the rich white Republicans think they can write any law they want to at any time.""
His frustration grew, he said, when Mr. Lay took part in an online chat within the company on Sept. 26 and brushed off Mr. Vernon's question about the way Enron had accounted for deals it had made with supposedly independent partnerships. Enron began to collapse after it became known in November that it had used the partnerships to overstate earnings by at least $600 million.
By mid-November, with Enron's stock plunging, Mr. Vernon had begun to post dozens of messages a day on the Yahoo discussion board under the screen name ""utlonghornsrule,"" referring to the University of Texas, where he received a master's degree in economics.
His messages warned investors away from Enron's stock, and many sharply criticized Enron and Mr. Lay. ""We were just sitting there with nothing to do,"" Mr. Vernon said of the period when he posted the messages. ""We were just sitting there watching our stocks go down.""
The final straw for him came Nov. 19, he said, when Enron canceled its Christmas party. At 5:16 p.m. that day, in a (not always grammatical) message sprinkled with vulgarities, Mr. Vernon wrote that Mr. Lay had ""just cancelled the Enron christmas party so he wouldn't have to show up for his own party with armed bodyguards.""
He went on, ""Lied and said employees were ambivalent. Trust me, nobody believes a word"" that Mr. Lay says, the posting said, using a vulgar epithet. ""People have enjoyed the company spending a few dollars on them and giving them a chance to laugh and dance a bit. Esp since most of us adore our coworkers.
""Ken Lay is the sorriest sack of garbage I have ever been associated with, a truly evil and satanic figure.""
Other people quickly posted responses defending Mr. Lay, including one who wrote, ""1) You are an embarrassment to UT - so shut up. 2) You don't know what you are talking about - You don't run with the big dogs."" Mr. Vernon said the style of that note led him to think that it was the work of a senior Enron employee.
It did not take long for Enron to find out the identity of ""utlonghornsrule."" The day after his vituperative posting, Mr. Vernon said, he was called into a meeting with his manager and a top human resources officer. ""My boss said, `What were you doing?' and I said, `I was frustrated,' "" Mr. Vernon said. ""They escorted me out immediately."" He said he had been paid his salary, but no severance pay.
Mr. Vernon said he understood why he was fired. ""I was using their equipment,"" he said, ""I was in their building, and it was a flagrant violation of company policy to do what I did. I'm not going to litigate it. I don't think it was unfair.""
He does not see himself as a whistle-blower, he said, and he is embarrassed by the language his anger led him to use - but he is still angry.

Bush Says His Mother-In-Law Lost Money On Enron

01/22/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP)--U.S. President George W. Bush said Tuesday that he is outraged that Enron (ENRNQ) workers didn't know the extent of the energy firm's financial problems and disclosed that his mother-in-law had invested in the company. 
""What I'm outraged about is that employees didn't know all the facts about Enron. My own mother-in-law bought stock last summer and it's not worth anything now,"" Bush said.
Bush didn't say how much stock his mother-in-law, Jenna Welch, purchased, but said ""she did not know all the facts"" about Enron's financial situation. ""A lot of the stockholders didn't know all of the facts. And that's wrong,"" he said. 
Bush said again he had no intention of releasing details of Enron contacts with White House aides who developed his energy plan, saying if ""somebody has an accusation of wrongdoing, let me know."" 
Thousands of Enron employees who bought company stock for their retirement accounts saw their savings evaporate as Enron tumbled toward bankruptcy. Shareholders suffered heavy losses as Enron stock, valued at nearly $90 a share in late 2000, fell far below $1. 
Bush said that Congress is investigating the Enron debacle, ""but Congress also needs to stay focused on the American people. We're in a war. We've got to make sure our homeland is secure and we've got to make sure that people can find work."" 
Bush said that he didn't think the emerging Enron investigation will distract from his agenda. ""All the facts will come out on Enron,"" Bush said, adding the administration has launched a criminal investigation and is reviewing pension policies in the wake of the company's bankruptcy. 
""Our administration has done exactly the right thing,"" he said. ""There have been a couple of contacts and my Cabinet said no help here.""

USA: UPDATE 1-Bush defends handling of Enron, promises changes.
By Patricia Wilson

(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

BELLE, W.Va., Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush on Tuesday defended the administration's handling of Enron Corp.'s dramatic collapse and promised government action to better protect investors like his mother-in-law, who lost thousands on the company's stock. 
""Our administration has done the exact right thing,"" the president said of contacts between the White House and Enron, Bush's biggest political patron, before the Houston-based trading company declared bankruptcy on Dec. 2, the biggest filing of its kind in U.S. history. White House officials said they did nothing to help Enron after concluding its collapse would have little impact on energy markets and the underlying economy.
Bush expressed ""outrage"" at the treatment of Enron employees and shareholders who were unaware of the extent of the firm's financial problems, and disclosed for the first time that the first lady's mother, Jenna Welch, bought stock in the company last summer. ""It's not worth anything,"" Bush said. 
Welch bought 200 shares at $40.90 for an investment of $8,180 on Sept. 21, 1999. She sold on Dec. 4, at 42 cents a share, for $84, two days after Enron's bankruptcy filing, the White House said. 
The president also urged anyone with ""an accusation about some wrongdoing just let me know."" 
""A lot of shareholders didn't know all the facts and that's wrong,"" Bush told reporters traveling with him in West Virginia. ""And so our government must do something about it, must make sure that the accounting practices that have been going on for quite a while are addressed, make sure there's full disclosure and the corporate (governance) issues are wide open for everybody to understand."" 
Bush's team has close ties to Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay. 
The company ranked as Bush's biggest financial backer heading into the 2000 presidential election, making some $623,000 in contributions to his campaigns since 1993. 
Last autumn, Lay called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans, Bush's 2000 campaign manager, to warn them of Enron's mounting financial problems. 
Enron President Lawrence ""Greg"" Whalley also called Treasury Undersecretary Peter Fisher in late October and early November seeking help for the beleaguered energy-trading giant. 
Bush said his Cabinet's response to Enron was: ""No help here."" The president said he spoke to O'Neill and Evans about their contacts with Enron, but did not say when that occurred. 
The White House has sought to distance itself from the widening scandal surrounding Enron. 
Thousands of employees lost their jobs and pensions and life savings in the former Wall Street darling's downfall, which began when the company acknowledged several hundred million dollars of previously undisclosed liabilities. 
Several congressional committees, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the company's demise. 
Bush brushed aside suggestions that the scandal would prove a distraction as Congress takes up his top budget priorities - the war on terrorism and the economy. 
""I believe Congress knows what it needs to do. It needs to fund the war. It needs to fund homeland security. It needs to work on ways to create jobs,"" the president said.

USA: SEC advises better disclosure on Enron-like deals.

01/22/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Federal regulators told companies on Tuesday as they prepare their annual reports that better disclosure is needed for off-balance sheet deals and other accounting methods associated with fallen energy trader Enron Corp. 
""We need better disclosure about these matters in this reporting season,"" said Robert Herdman, chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission, in a statement.
""Our hope is that public companies will go beyond the minimum legal requirements and serve investors with the very best possible discussion of the company's financial position and operating results."" 
Companies are required to file with the SEC their annual report, called a 10K, within 90 days after their year ends. 
Tuesday's SEC statement reminded companies of current disclosure requirements and suggested steps that they should consider in meeting the requirements for liquidity and capital resources, including off-balance sheet arrangements, as well as the effects of transactions with related parties. 
At the heart of Enron's problems were complex financial partnerships known as special-purpose entities set up by Enron executives and used to keep debt off the company's highly leveraged books. 
After some deals involving the partnerships went sour, Enron in October had to take a $1 billion charge against earnings and cut shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. 
Those moves drew market attention to the partnerships, triggering a crisis in investor confidence and credit-rating downgrades that ultimately led to bankruptcy court. 
The SEC disclosure statement did not create new legal requirements or change existing ones. The commission is considering proposing rules to improve disclosure consistency and completeness. 
The Big 5 accounting firms and their trade group, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, had asked the agency earlier this month to require better disclosure. 
People reading Enron's financial statements were left scratching their heads in confusion over the company's off-balance sheet deals. 
The company's auditor, Andersen, also took heat for not doing more to explain Enron's complex financing arrangements. 
""The commission will continue to study how it can bring about further improvements in disclosure concerning critical accounting policies,"" the SEC's chief accountant said.

USA: Congress could hamper Justice in Enron case-experts.
By Susan Cornwell

01/22/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - As Congress pursues a raft of investigations into the collapse of Enron Corp., some experts warn that lawmakers' zeal could trip up the Justice Department's criminal probe. 
They point to the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s, when the convictions of former White House aide Oliver North and former National Security Adviser John Poindexter were tossed out because of their earlier testimony before Congress.
Both men had been granted limited or ""use"" immunity before Congress, which meant they could not be prosecuted for what they said in their testimony. 
So far there is no sign that any witnesses in the Enron case will receive such immunity from Congress, but many witness lists are still being drawn up and lawmakers' intentions are unclear. 
Joseph diGenova, a former independent counsel and U.S. attorney, warns that if officials from Enron and its auditor Andersen demand immunity, it could make the Justice Department's job impossible. 
""It's not a wise idea to give immunity to the main players,"" he told Reuters. ""It's a pass. If a committee gives immunity, it makes prosecution impossible."" 
""If the witnesses are willing to testify without immunity, if they are stupid enough to do that, then by God, go on, bring them up,"" diGenova added. 
At least eight congressional committees are probing Enron, and two - the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee - plan hearings on Thursday, the day after Congress returns from its break. 
""These hearings, if they involve testimony by the principal defendants, could effectively interfere with serious criminal prosecution,"" said John Coffee, Columbia Law School professor. 
""If I were counsel for many of these players, I would demand 'use' immunity. Some congressional committee might care more about its hearings than about prosecution. That would be probably a misuse of power, but it could happen,"" he said. 
ENRON'S LAY TO TESTIFY

Vinson & Elkins parry Enron onslaught
Firm notably absent in lawsuit minefield 
By MARY FLOOD 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 21, 2002, 11:31PM

Though dozens of lawsuits have been filed against Enron, its executives and auditors, one party with deep pockets has dodged legal action: 

The 860-plus-member Houston law firm of Vinson & Elkins, one of the biggest legal powerhouses in Texas. 

""They are the 800-pound gorilla,"" said Houston lawyer Valorie Davenport, who recently won a $73 million jury verdict against a New York City law firm. 

Vinson & Elkins has been named in just one Harris County suit and a companion suit in another county, both dismissed after a few weeks. 

Caution, not professional courtesy, has probably protected Vinson & Elkins so far, lawyers said. The firm helped craft the law that protects lawyers from lawsuits, is a major source of referrals for the very lawyers who might sue them and knows every legal tactic that could slow or sidetrack the lawsuits, the lawyers noted. 

""There is a hierarchy of deep pockets. The lawyers are the last ones you sue. They are the hardest to get to legally,"" said Randy Johnston, a Dallas lawyer who specializes in legal malpractice. 

Johnston said the first target in a financial debacle is the failed company itself. If its assets are frozen in bankruptcy, as Enron's are, the auditors are next in line, in part because the public relies on their word, he said. 

""You see certified public accountants, but not certified public attorneys,"" he said. ""We know attorneys look out for their clients, not the public. The rules insulate them further."" 

Texas case law, partly decided in a suit involving Vinson & Elkins itself, has made the state one of only a handful where a third party cannot sue for damages because of a lawyer's malpractice. Law firms can be sued for fraud or conspiracy, both hard to prove. 

Vinson & Elkins managing partner Joe Dilg said his firm did nothing wrong in its work for Enron, but ""anyone can sue, there is nothing we can do to stop it."" 

But the firm did sideline the two early suits against it, by hiring Joe Jamail, a well-known plaintiffs attorney. Within 22 days of its being named as a defendant, he convinced the lawyers to drop Vinson & Elkins from their suits. 

Dilg, citing attorney-client privilege, would not comment on specific Enron matters but said the firm rendered no accounting opinions, only legal ones. 

Vinson & Elkins is named in an August memo from Enron Vice President Sherron Smith Watkins to Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay. Watkins said because the law firm worked on some of the company's problematic off-the-books partnerships, another firm should investigate the practice. 

Instead, the company brought in Vinson & Elkins. After an inquiry, the law firm reported on Oct. 15 that the practices caused concern ""because of the bad cosmetics"" and could result in adverse publicity and litigation, but warranted no ""further widespread investigation by independent counsel and auditors."" 

The law firm questioned then-Enron and Arthur Andersen employees, including those Watkins had suggested they interview. 

Johnston and others said Vinson & Elkins is likely to be sued if Andersen should also file for bankruptcy, which some think is possible. 

""Another reason you try not to sue lawyers is if you sue V&E, you immediately eliminate hundreds of sources of referrals, maybe more because you could also be boycotted by the other big firms,"" Johnston said. 

Further, a sophisticated defendant like Vinson & Elkins can bring a lawsuit to a virtual standstill. Several lawyers said they do not want to slow their suits by naming the firm as a defendant. 

Davenport, who recently won a $73 million jury verdict against New York City law firm Greenberg, Traurig, Hoffman and Lippman in a Galveston securities fraud case, said many lawyers in Texas and elsewhere have professional ties to Vinson & Elkins or to its attorney Jamail. 

""But it's my guess that there are very aggressive lawyers at V&E who lost their way,"" Davenport said. She said in recent years lawyers, accountants and other professionals have been pressed to find loopholes and technicalities to justify actions ""that are against the spirit of the law but called `creativity.' "" 

""I'm looking at (Enron) cases now and have every intent of suing all responsible parties, including law firms,"" Davenport said. 

Vinson & Elkins has been Enron's main outside counsel, but many other large firms have done a lot of work for the company, which also had a huge stable of in-house lawyers. 

Sean Jez, a Houston attorney whose firm filed a shareholder lawsuit, said they too are looking at Vinson & Elkins' involvement and are trying to gather evidence to see if it or any other defendants should be added. 

""We're not afraid to sue anybody, but I don't think we know yet what V&E has done,"" he said. ""We've sued big, big boys before."" 

Larry Doherty, a specialist in legal malpractice, said it's just a matter of time before lawyers, bankers and others are brought into these lawsuits. 

""With all the litigation swirling around Enron it's interesting that nobody's put V&E in and kept them in yet,"" Doherty said. ""But if the wheel comes off the wagon and people who were a part of this start pointing fingers, all the other parties will likely fall like dominoes, law firms and all."" 


SEC Issues Disclosure Guidelines For Annual Reports
By Phil McCarty

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The Securities and Exchange Commission released a statement Tuesday designed to provide companies with additional guidance regarding existing disclosure rules.
The statement is in response to a petition submitted by the Big Five accounting firms late last year, asking the agency for new guidance or new rules regarding disclosures in corporate annual reports. 
In the wake of Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) financial collapse, which included a $569 million earnings restatement, the Big Five firms suggested the SEC consider specific areas dealing with off-balance sheet transactions, over-the-counter derivatives contracts and related party transactions. 
The statement doesn't create new legal requirements or modify existing legal requirements, the SEC said, but it is intended to help companies produce better disclosures ahead of the upcoming annual reporting season. Annual reports are due 90 days after a company's year-end, which, for most, will fall in the last week of March. 
""While existing rules mandate explanations of material uncertainties, our hope is that public companies will go beyond the minimum legal requirements and serve investors with the very best possible discussion of the company's financial position and operating results,"" said SEC Chief Accountant Robert Herdman. 
In a petition submitted Dec. 31, the Big Five firms asserted that many companies provide only ""boilerplate"" information that contains ""little or no meaningful"" details. 
In reply, the SEC said companies should provide the most relevant information and provide it using language and formats that investors can be expected to understand. But companies shouldn't be overly general, the agency said. 
""Disclosures that the (company) has sufficient short-term funding to meet its liquidity needs for the next year provides little useful information,"" the SEC said. ""Instead, (companies) should consider describing the sources of short-term funding and the circumstances that are reasonably likely to affect those sources of liquidity."" 
With respect to off-balance sheet arrangements, the SEC said companies should consider providing disclosures concerning transactions, arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to affect liquidity or the availability of capital. Specifically, companies should mention arrangements that contractually limit their ability to transfer or access assets. 
Accounting standards already require companies to disclose commitments to make future payments under contracts, but the SEC said it believes investors would ""find it beneficial if aggregate information about contractual obligations were provided in a single location."" 
As it is now, companies disclose contractual obligations in various parts of their annual reports. 
The SEC said it is also concerned about a lack of clarity in the disclosure of trading activities involving commodity contracts. Companies that trade commodities contracts over the counter, rather than on an exchange, should consider providing further disclosures that supplement those required by accounting standards. Specifically, commodity disclosures should provide additional statistical and other information about these business activities, the associated risks involved and any trends. 
Finally, the agency issued guidance on related-party transactions. While firms are required to disclose related-party deals, they should also discuss the business purpose of the arrangement, its economic substance and the effects on financial statements, the SEC added.

Dominion Resources Files Lawsuit Against Enron Corp
By Kathy Chu

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dominion Resources Inc. (DNIR) has filed a lawsuit against two bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) units, seeking to claim $664,749 related to natural gas sales.
The suit, filed late Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, alleges that natural gas was delivered to Enron Upstream last November at $3.14 per million British thermal units, but payment wasn't received. 
Dominion is asking the court to declare that it has a valid ""first priority"" lien on the assets of Enron Upstream, as well as the unit's parent, Enron North America. 
If the request is granted, Dominion's claims would be placed before those of Enron's unsecured creditors - increasing the chances that Dominion will be paid for some of its debts. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said Tuesday that the bankrupt company will ""work with our creditors committee and the bankruptcy court to make sure that all creditors are treated equitably.""

USA: WRAPUP 1-Credit quality in broad decline as defaults soar.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Corporate credit quality will likely grow much worse before it gets better, and about $100 billion of corporate debt will likely go into default this year as the United States heads into recession, according to reports issued on Monday by two top credit rating agencies. 
Moody's Investors Service said it put ratings on review for downgrade for 122 U.S. companies with $543 billion of debt in the third quarter, dwarfing the 22 companies with $66 billion of debt it put on review for upgrade. Reviews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit. 
""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. 
Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's said more than 200 companies will default on about $100 billion of debt this year, compared with 117 defaulting on a record $42.3 billion in 2000. 
It said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated ""BB-plus"" or lower by S&P and ""Ba1"" or lower by Moody's because of their credit risks - will reach 9.4 percent by year end. Moody's forecasts a 10 percent rate. 
""The U.S. economy is clearly in a recession,"" said S&P Chief Economist David Wyss in a statement. ""Although Standard & Poor's expects it to be relatively mild and end in early 2002, the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is high."" 
Both agencies said the Sept. 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a three-year slump in corporate credit quality. Moody's blamed 38 reviews for downgrade in September alone on the attacks. 
COSTS RISE, PROTECTION WEAKENS 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. 
These include the weakening economy, the inability of many marginal companies to raise cash at tolerable interest rates, share buybacks, debt-financed merger activity, and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance and travel. 
""Many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dry up and be pushed over the brink,"" said David Keisman, managing director at S&P Risk Solutions. 
Even well-known companies are suffering rating declines. 
On Monday alone, for example, S&P downgraded McDonald Corp. after the world's largest fast-food chain said it will buy back up to $5 billion of stock, at a time S&P said the company's ""growth prospects for the future are less optimistic."" 
Meanwhile, Moody's downgraded Enron Corp., and warned it may downgrade it again. The energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confidence, reflected in a share price that has plunged by more than half in two weeks, as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business. 
Puchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues,"" he said. 
Still, through Friday, Moody's has said in the fourth quarter it may downgrade 47 companies, and upgrade just four.

USA: U.S. firms say deals with Enron at normal levels.
By Andrew Kelly

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Major U.S. wholesale natural gas and electricity traders said on Monday their deals with troubled Enron Corp. are still running at normal levels. 
But some are keeping a wary eye on the company's finances and credit status after a downgrade by one of the major rating agencies.
""We certainly are very well aware of what our exposure is to them and watching that on a daily basis,"" Chief Executive Marce Fuller of Atlanta energy marketer Mirant Corp. told Reuters. 
""At this point, I would categorize it as pretty much as business as usual with Enron, but we'll have to keep a close eye on it as we move forward,"" said Fuller. 
Officials at companies such as Houston natural gas firm El Paso Corp. and Columbus, Ohio, utility holding company American Electric Power Co. Inc. expressed similar sentiments, saying nothing had changed in their dealings with the Houston-based energy company, at least for the time being. 
""We continue to trade with them,"" said spokeswoman Jennifer Pierce of Charlotte-based utility Duke Energy Corp.. ""They've always been meticulous in their credit management and we continue to see that with them,"" she added. 
Enron's shares fell to yet another new low on Monday as the company said it was lobbying banks for a new credit line and rating agency Moody's Investor Service downgraded the company's senior unsecured debt to two notches above junk-bond status. 
Since Oct. 12 Enron's stock has fallen some 60 percent after the company reported its first quarterly loss in over four years, wrote down shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion dollars and failed to quell investors' jitters about a series of complex off-balance-sheet financial deals. 
CONFIDENCE CRUMBLES 
Analysts say that if confidence in Enron continued to crumble, it could restrict the company's access to credit and thus create problems for its core energy trading operations. 
European energy industry sources told Reuters earlier on Monday that there was already evidence of European companies shying away from trading with Enron because of credit worries. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron in Europe as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements, the sources said. 
""They are talking with us about bank letters of credit,"" said the head of risk management at one U.K. utility that halted its trade with Enron last week. ""The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis."" 
Traders in the U.S. wholesale energy markets said on Monday that they were continuing to deal with Enron and still regard the company as a reliable trading partner. 
""I don't have any problems dealing with Enron, especially since I'm doing day-ahead trades. But I have heard the rumors of people not wanting to deal with them,"" one natural gas trader in the U.S. Southeast told Reuters. 
A trader who specializes in longer-term deals in the forwards market for electricity said publicity about Enron's woes had not yet led to any loss of market liquidity. 
""Obviously there's a concern, but the financial situation is not a factor now,"" the trader said. 
Despite the public words of reassurance that many of them have been speaking, Enron's major competitors and trading partners continue to monitor the situation closely. 
""Any time a counterparty starts looking like their credit rating is deteriorating, then that would certainly be a signal to us to become more worried,"" said Mirant's Fuller.

Enron Bonds Stabilize But Market Players Are Concerned
By Michael C. Barr
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/29/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Uncertainty about Enron Corp. (ENE) continues to dog investors concerned about the future of the Houston-based energy services company. 
""It's such a fluid situation that the market would like to see a clarification of the company's circumstances,"" said Eric Bergson, portfolio manager, Northern Trust Global Investments, Chicago. Until this occurs, the outlook for the company's bonds is choppy, he added.
Enron drew down about $3 billion in credit lines last week to increase cash reserves and calm jittery markets, buying back its outstanding commercial paper. And, it's currently negotiating with its bank group for an additional $1 billion to $2 billion in new credit, according to a report in Monday's Wall Street Journal. 
Enron's troubles began earlier this month with the announcement of a $618 million third-quarter loss and the disclosure of a $1.2 billion erosion of investor equity related to transactions conducted with its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
""The company did not learn from the mistakes of others by not being ahead of the game on disclosure,"" said Mitch Stapley, portfolio manager and chief fixed income officer, Fifth Third Investment Advisors, Grand Rapids, Mich. It becomes harder to regain investors' trust, he said. 
Moody's Investors Service lowered the company's senior unsecured long-term debt rating Monday to Baa2 from Baa1. The debt is rated triple-B-plus by Standard & Poor's Corp., with a negative outlook. Fitch also maintains a triple-B-plus rating and it placed the debt on Rating Watch Negative late last week. 
Both Fitch and Moody's cited negative investor reaction to recent company developments. And Moody's added that its ""analysis of the developing situation will focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties."" 
One money manager said he was concerned ""about the fallout and its impact on the company's ability to trade"" energy. 
The company's bonds already have suffered as a result of the uncertainty. The bonds with a 6.40% coupon maturing in 2006 were offered at a dollar price of 80 on Friday. Many investors believe that the 80 dollar price point is a demarcation separating high-yield debt from distressed debt levels. 
The company's bonds improved a little on Monday, to about an 83 dollar price. 
""I'm seeing offerings but no bids,"" said Harold Rivkin, principal, H. Rivkin & Co., Princeton, N.J. There is a reluctance on the part of potential buyers because of the threat of future downgrades, he said. 
The cool reception that Enron's bonds are receiving is ""another example of an investment grade company not having sponsorship when it has problems,"" said Northern Trust's Bergson. 
The company did not respond to a telephone request for comment.

Enron's stock continues slide on credit woes

10/29/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp.'s stock slid to new lows on Monday, pushed down in part by Moody's Investors Service announcing a possible downgrade of the company's credit rating pending a review. 
The downgrade came as Enron negotiates with banks to establish new credit lines as the largest U.S. natural gas and power marketing company struggles to bounce back from disappointing third quarter earnings and a scandal over losses stemming from partnerships managed by the company's former chief financial officer.
In trading Monday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down nearly 9 percent, or dlrs 1.38 a share, at dlrs 14.02 - their lowest level in nearly seven years. A year ago, Enron stock sold at nearly dlrs 85 a share. 
Enron's efforts to acquire more credit came after the Houston-based company last week decided to cash in about dlrs 3 billion in revolving credit it has with various banks to shore up investor confidence. 
""We are in discussions about new credit lines,"" Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Monday. ""We're taking action to restore investor and market confidence."" 
Denne would not disclose how much credit the company was seeking. But The Wall Street Journal quoted unidentified sources who said the amount is between dlrs 1 billion and dlrs 2 billion and that the deal is close to being completed. 
Denne said of the dlrs 3 billion in credit Enron cashed in last week, dlrs 2 billion of it was used to pay short term debt. Currently, there are no plans for the other dlrs 1 billion, she said. 
Moody's on Monday placed all of Enron's long term debt obligations on review for downgrade, citing ""substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses."" 
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of dlrs 638 million in the third quarter, taking a one-time charge of dlrs 1.01 billion attributed to investment losses, troubled assets and unit restructurings. 
Enron's stock was hammered over the next week as it became apparent some of those losses were tied to partnerships managed by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
Concerns about a potential conflict of interest touched off an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Enron ousted Fastow last week. 
Moody's said in a press release the ""magnitude of the announced charges will reduce Enron's equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat over 50 percent while slashing earnings.""

UK: UK power mkt focuses on prompt after low peak deal.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Interest in Britain's electricity markets focused on the prompt after the sale of peak power at an unexpected low price tugged other prompt contracts lower. 
Traders said the market was surprised by the sale of day ahead peak power for EFA blocks three and four, from 0700 to 1500, at 13.50 pounds per megawatt hour which they said was below coal-or gas-fired power stations' operating cost.
""It was an interesting day. It was hard to believe someone could sell at those prices - it's below marginal costs,"" said one trader. 
Day ahead baseload opened relatively firm at 19.50/20.50 pounds but slipped during the day to around 18 pounds and was traded at about 17.56 pounds after the low peak trades. 
Traders said the forward curve was quite with contracts ending slightly lower. 
Attention focused on troubled U.S. energy trader Enron with European companies shying away from dealing with the utility because of credit concerns. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements. 
Enron is one of the largest traders in the UK market but traders said it was too early see any impact on liquidity. 
""Friday and Monday tend to be quieter anyway - it's hard to tell if there's any effect from Enron,"" said one trader. 
Enron in London declined to comment on the situation.

USA: UPDATE 2-Enron says in talks with banks for new credit line.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
(Changes paragraph 1, adds background details and byline, updates stock price) 
By David Howard Sinkman
NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp., its shares in a new free-fall to near seven-year lows, said on Monday it is seeking additional credit to bolster investor confidence after tapping about $3 billion in credit last week. 
Enron, the nation's biggest energy trader, declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with or when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line. 
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston, referring to company efforts to secure new credit. 
Company shares again tumbled on Monday, shedding $1.57, or 10.13 percent, to $13.93 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Once a Wall Street darling, the stock has tumbled more than half in price since Enron released earnings two weeks ago, losing about $15.1 billion in market capitalization as investors fretted about the transparency of off-balance sheet transactions. 
Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status, and warned it may cut it again, as well as its rating for Enron's commercial paper. Rating agency Standard & Poor's on Thursday revised its outlook for Enron's ratings to ""negative"" from ""stable."" 
Enron's credit-worthiness has a direct affect on the price it pays to take out loans, and the perception among its trading partners on the company's ability to make good on trades. 
Moody's said Enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write-downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments. It said this triggered ""difficulties in rolling over commercial paper."" 
Industry sources on Monday said several large energy companies in Europe are shying away from trading with Enron amid concerns about the company's credit status. 
SIGN OF WEAKNESS 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the size of the credit line Enron is negotiating is between $1 billion to $2 billion. Enron said it drew down about $3 billion in credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
However, many industry observes see the request by Enron, which has about $63.4 billion in energy assets, for an additional credit as a sign of weakness. 
""Clearly, both the stock and bond market view Enron as being in dire straits,"" said independent research firm Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson, who specializes in high grade corporate bonds. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead it's an act of desperation.""

USA: TRADE IDEA-Junk rating not likely for Enron.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - A collapse of market 
confidence could hurt the credit quality of energy trading
giant Enron Corp., but its bonds are not likely to end 
up in junk territory, fixed-income research service GimmeCredit 
said on Monday. 
Moreover, Enron's bonds could be undervalued if the 
company's off-balance-sheet obligations amount to no more 
than $3 billion, as reported, GimmeCredit said. 
""Worst case, Enron doesn't look like a junk credit,"" 
GimmeCredit analyst Carol Levenson said. ""But perception is 
all, and clearly both the stock and bond markets view Enron 
as being in dire straits."" 
Enron's bonds fell sharply on Friday after the energy 
giant drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and 
said it was in talks with its banks to obtain a new 
multibillion-dollar credit line. 
The company's stock has lost more than half of its 
value in the last two weeks as investors questioned 
off-balance-sheet transactions between the company and two 
limited partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer 
Andrew Fastow. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
is looking into those transactions for possible conflicts 
of interest. 
""We admit management's financial disclosure remains 
woefully inadequate,"" GimmeCredit said. ""However, botched 
investor communication does not necessarily equate to 
illegal or fraudulent behavior."" 
Still, Enron's move last week to draw down all of its 
backup bank lines was ""an act of desperation,"" GimmeCredit 
said. The move eventually may lead to renegotiated bank 
agreements, which could be more expensive and restrictive 
and could also subordinate the position of bondholders, it 
said. 
""On the plus side is our belief that management will do 
everything in their power to preserve the company's 
investment-grade ratings,"" the firm said. 
Another positive is a precedent the rating agencies set 
with Kmart Corp. in the mid-1990s, when they tried to avoid 
being the cause of a company's financial downfall, GimmeCredit 
said. 
Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut Enron's senior 
unsecured rating to ""Baa2"" from ""Baa1"" and kept it on 
review for further downgrade. Moody's said its actions were 
prompted by deterioration in Enron's financial flexibility 
since the company announced significant write-downs and 
equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership 
investments. 
Last Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its outlook on 
Enron to negative while affirming its ""BBB-plus"" long-term 
rating.

USA: Enron shares drop to near seven-year lows.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. shares fell to their lowest level in almost seven years in early trade on Monday following news that North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader was considering tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron shares were down $1.55, or 10 percent, to $13.95 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have not been under $14 since December 1994.
Earlier, the credit-rating agency Moody's Investor Service placed all long term-debt obligations of Enron under review for downgrade following the company's announcement of significant write-downs and charges, reflecting substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses. 
Moody's said the actions affect Enron's broadband operations, its merchant portfolio, and the Azurix water company holdings. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

Enron long-term ratings all placed on review for downgrade - Moody's

10/29/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Moody's Investors Service said it placed all the long-term debt obligations of Enron on review for downgrade following the company's announcement of significant write-downs and charges, reflecting substantially reduced valuations in several of its businesses. 
The magnitude of the announced charges will reduce Enron's equity base and increase nominal financial leverage to somewhat over 50 pct while slashing earnings, Moody's said in a statement.
The company's previously announced sale of Portland General, however, will result in cash proceeds approximating 1.8 bln usd which management is earmarking for debt reduction. In addition, the sale will remove approximately 1 bln usd of debt obligations from Enron's balance sheet. 
However, Moody's noted that, while this transaction will go a long way to help restore Enron's balance sheet, it requires regulatory approval and is likely to take up to a year to complete. 
Enron has a Baa1 senior unsecured rating.

Enron Shares Fall After Moody's Cuts Credit Rating (Update6)

Enron Shares Fall After Moody's Cuts Credit Rating (Update6)

     (Adds bondholder quote and background on commercial paper.)

     New York, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares declined
a ninth day as Moody's Investors Service lowered its credit
rating, raising concern the largest energy trader would be cut off
from raising the cash it needs to fund day-to-day operations.

     Moody's lowered Enron's senior unsecured long-term debt
ratings to ``Baa2,'' two levels above junk, from ``Baa1'' and also
placed the Houston-based company's ``P-2'' rating for commercial
paper on review for downgrade.

     Moody's may downgrade Enron's commercial paper rating, which
would make it harder for the firm to borrow the short-term cash
needed to run its trading businesses. Ahead of a potential cut,
Enron took out bank lines to repay $2 billion in commercial paper
last week, largely removing itself from that borrowing arena.

     ``They've pretty much already written off coming to the
commercial-paper market,'' said Shannon Bass, who holds Enron
bonds in the $50 million he helps manage at Pacific Investment
Management Co. ``The real issue now is trying to get their house
in order.''

     Pimco is ``well underweight'' Enron bonds relative to bond
benchmarks the portfolios are matched to, Bass said.

                             Shut Out

     Companies such as Xerox Corp., which was shut out of the
commercial-paper market a year ago before its credit ratings were
reduced, were forced to borrow on bank credit lines to access
cash. Investors in commercial paper, borrowings due in nine months
or less, also stopped buying Motorola Inc. and Lucent Technologies
Inc. short-term debt, forcing the firms to restructure borrowing,
sell assets, and find alternative financing sources that typically
cost more.

     Enron shares plunged $1.59, or 10 percent, to $13.81,
continuing a slide that dates back to Oct. 17, when Enron reported
$1.01 billion in losses from investments outside its business of
energy trading.

     The stock traded near $90 in September 2000 and touched a
seven-year low of $13.55 today. Enron has lost more than $50
billion in market value this year. On Dec. 31, the company had a
market capitalization of $62.7 billion. Today, the market value
was $10.5 billion.

                           Deterioration

     While Enron shares have sank about 60 percent in a week, its
bonds are down about 20 percent. A company's stock typically falls
faster than its debt because bondholders have first claim on
assets after bank loans are paid.

     The company's 6.4 percent bonds maturing in 2006 fell 4 cents
to 80 cents on the $1 of face value after the Moody's downgrade.
Yields have risen to 12.1 percent, up from 10.8 before that
downgrade, traders said. The bonds were trading at 100 cents the
week before.

     Moody's said the cut was prompted by the ``deterioration in
Enron's financial flexibility'' since the write-downs and charges.
The partnership investments had not been disclosed before this
month, which ``led to a substantial loss in investor confidence,''
according to Moody's.

     ``A credit downgrade will be punitive as far as their
borrowing power,'' said Joe Correnti, who follows Enron for Wayne
Hummer Investments LLC in Chicago. ``That's not a good place for
them to be. They have somewhat aggressive expansion plans.''

     Enron's recent woes had many investors factoring in a credit-
rating reduction. ``This move was anticipated,'' said Mike Dineen,
who holds Enron bonds in the $5 billion of fixed-income assets he
helps manage at Mony Life Insurance Co.

     There are about $15.8 billion of Enron bonds outstanding,
almost $9 billion of which comes due between 2003 and 2006,
according to Bloomberg data.

                            Cash Needed

     Last week, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for
information about transactions he conducted for partnerships he
headed. In August, Jeff Skilling quit as Enron chief executive,
eight months after taking the position, and Chairman Ken Lay moved
back into the position.

    Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company's stock
has plummeted 57 percent since Oct. 17, when Fastow's partnerships
were disclosed.

    Enron uses its investment-grade credit rating to borrow money
for the cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades and
to keep trading partners.

     ``When you act as a middleman you need high credit ratings.
It's likely their trading volumes will go down'' as other energy
and financial firms seek higher-rated trading partners, said Sean
Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co., which gives
Enron's credit a junk grade of ``BB+.''

     Enron's long-term ratings outlook was changed last week to
negative from stable by Standard & Poor's. S&P affirmed the firm's
rating of ``BBB+'', the equivalent of Moody's ``Baa1''.

     ``We have been split-rated before and it did not affect our
growth,'' said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron.
``We are still investment grade.''



Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update2)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.59, or 10 percent, to
$13.81. The stock has tumbled 82 percent in the past 12 months.



Enron May Be Royal Dutch/Shell Takeover Target, Newsletter Says
2001-10-29 13:31 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- The Royal Dutch/Shell Group,
the second-largest publicly traded oil company, may be interested
in buying Enron Corp., which has seen its stock price plunge in
the last two weeks, industry newsletter Power Finance & Risk
reported, citing unnamed sources.

     With Enron's market valued dropping below $11.5 billion from
a high of more than $55 billion, companies such as Royal
Dutch/Shell would be able to buy it with ``little trouble,'' the
newsletter reported.

     Royal Dutch/Shell, based in London and The Hague,
Netherlands, had approached Enron about a buyout in August, and
has sought to purchase the company for three years, the newsletter
said, citing an unnamed banker in London and an unnamed analyst in
New York.

     Shell spokesman Mary Brennan said the company wouldn't
comment on market speculation. Enron didn't immediately return
calls seeking comment on reports of possible buyout offer.



Enron Credit Cut by Moody's; CP Rating Put on Review (Update3)

Enron Credit Cut by Moody's; CP Rating Put on Review (Update3)

     (Adds yield data in fourth paragraph; adds Moody's comments
in sixth and seventh paragraphs.)

     New York, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
was cut by Moody's Investors Service after the largest energy
trader wrote down the value of its assets because of losses from
private partnerships.

     Moody's also said it may downgrade Enron's commercial paper
rating, which could make it harder for the company to borrow the
short-term cash it needs to run its trading business in the
future. The company borrowed from banks to repay $2 billion in
commercial paper last week.

     ``This move was anticipated,'' said Mike Dineen, who holds
Enron bonds in the $5 billion of fixed-income assets he helps
manage at Mony Life Insurance Co.

     Enron's 6.4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell as much as
4 cents to bid at 80 cents on $1 of face value after the Moody's
downgrade, traders said. The bonds tumbled from about par value a
week ago. Yields have risen to 12.1 percent, up from 10.8 before
that downgrade, traders said. Shares of Enron fell as much as
$1.85, or 12 percent, to $13.55.

     Moody's lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings
of Enron to ``Baa2,'' two levels above junk, from ``Baa1.'' The
ratings company said they may be lowered further. Moody's placed
the company's ``P-2'' rating for commercial paper on review for
downgrade.

     Moody's said the cut was prompted by the ``deterioration in
Enron's financial flexibility'' since the write-downs and charges.
The partnership investments had not been disclosed before.

     Enron's recent disclosures have ``led to a substantial loss
in investor confidence,'' Moody's said in its news release.

                            Cash Needed

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses this month from
investments outside its business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
quit as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for
information about transactions he conducted for partnerships he
headed.

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company's stock
has plummeted 57 percent since Oct. 17, when the partnerships were
disclosed.

     Enron uses its investment-grade credit rating to borrow money
for the  cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades and
to keep trading partners.

     ``Enron definitely depends on higher ratings,'' Dineen said.
     Enron's long-term credit ratings outlook was changed last
week to negative from stable by Standard & Poor's. S&P affirmed
the Houston-based company's rating of ``BBB+'', the equivalent of
Moody's ``Baa1''.

     ``We have been split-rated before and it did not affect our
growth,'' said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron.
`` We are still investment grade.''



Insiders at Electric Utilities Showing Their Faith 
By Jonathan Moreland <<mailto:jonathan@insiderinsights.com>>

Name an industry where one of its best-known players went public in 1996, saw its stock rise more than 1,800% in the following five years, but now finds its shares half off their 2001 highs? Internet? Telecom equipment? 
Surprise! The stock is Calpine (CPN:NYSE - news - commentary) , and the industry is electric utilities. 
Three other stocks in the same group have given investors pretty wild rides as well, only to find themselves well off their 52-week highs: AES (AES:NYSE - news - commentary) , Mirant (MIR:NYSE - news - commentary) and NRG Energy (NRG:NYSE - news - commentary) . 
These four companies also have something else in common: Insiders at all of them are signaling that their stocks are oversold. When there is significant insider buying in so many related firms, we cannot help but think there is a positive industry trend to profit from. 
Utilities may not seem like a sexy sector, but these particular stocks have proved that they can move as well as any small-cap, high-tech play. Their volatility stems from the fact that the companies they represent are not regulated utilities paying fat dividends, but independent power producers (IPPs) that derive as much profit as they can from the margins over fuel costs. 
In some ways, IPPs are to regulated utilities what the old English navy was to the Spanish Armada. IPPs are less restricted in the scope and geography of their business movements. This has spurred a more entrepreneurial culture at IPPs that often allows them to outmaneuver regulated utilities when chasing after business opportunities. 
The insider buying at all four companies was obviously interesting. They all had several insiders recently purchasing within a short time period, and many of the buyers also had good track records trading their companies' shares. Several were also adding significantly to their holdings. 
At AES, for example, three of the eight executives that purchased shares in late September for $13 a share or less, were also smart sellers over the past few years when AES fetched between $40 to $60. And at Mirant, the five insiders that purchased in September increased their holdings by an average of 53%. 
This confluence of positive insider signals was more than enough to get me researching these companies and this industry further, and I like what I see. 
""There's been a lot of talk about if we have an oversupply of energy,"" remarks Calpine spokesperson Katherine Potter on one of the main reasons IPP stocks are weak now. ""But while supply may be fine right now, you also have to look at the quality of [that] supply. There is such a tremendous opportunity to replace infrastructure."" 
Out With the Old, In With the New
The fact is, there are a lot of antiquated power plants and overburdened backbones in the power industry, and IPPs stand to benefit tremendously from replacing the older infrastructure to service the growing demand for energy in the U.S. and abroad. 
With more scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of the present, aging facilities exacerbating price spikes, municipalities and industry would much rather choose reasonably priced energy from dependable sources if they are available. 
Although most IPPs use oil, gas, coal or a combination of these fuels to power present facilities, the vast majority of plants they're building now are a new generation of natural gas-powered turbines that are much more efficient than old gas-fired facilities. An IPP will typically build one of these new plants near cities or other areas with high and growing electricity needs, and compete with the older facilities in the region for the business. 
But it's not really fair competition. New plants can generate up to 40% more energy from the same amount of gas used by some older designs. The new natural gas turbines also have a smaller footprint and fewer emissions than their predecessors, and can therefore be located closer to where the power is needed. Can you say lower transmission costs? 
So with the cost of the natural gas representing a good two-thirds of a generator's cost, less fuel expenditure combined with a decrease in transmission infrastructure to pay for leaves more love left for an IPP's bottom line. 
As older gas-fired and nuclear plants are decommissioned, IPPs will continue to increase the amount of product (and profits) they produce. At the same time, the trend toward more efficient gas plants will help slow the increases in overall demand for natural gas, and keep the cost of this commodity from reaching stratospheric levels. 
Although, as previously mentioned, IPP stocks are well off their highs, analysts are as taken with the group as insiders are right now. Most analysts following the four IPPs I've recommended rate them a buy or strong buy. 
This is not too surprising considering that bottom-line growth for NRG, AES, and Calpine next year is forecast at 24% to 25%, while analysts expect Mirant to boost earnings per share by 30% in 2002. All of these shares are trading for 12 times or less the low end of next year's EPS expectations. 
Chartists will note that the technicals of the IPP stocks I've mentioned still look weak, and may choose to wait for a better entry point. But longer-term investors should feel comfortable joining the insiders now. 
Postscript
Readers will note that we have not included Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) in our group of recommended IPPs. Although we cannot boast of foreseeing its present travails (resulting from too-clever-by-half off-balance sheet investments), we had ignored it because Enron did not have a positive insider signal like its peers. 
Insiders were still selling Enron as late as Aug. 2 of this year when the stock was nearly half off its highs, and although there was one insider purchase in August, there was not a cluster of activity as in the other IPP stocks we've recommended. There was no buying after Sept. 11. 
If Enron's problems are unique to it, as the industry insiders we talked to believe, this is yet another case of insiders giving investors an excellent signal of relative attractiveness of stocks within an industry. 


A Debacle Like Enron's Can Undermine the Entire Market

Sometimes one stock can completely transfix the market in a negative way. 
Right now that one stock is Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) . It transfixes us because it acknowledges a simple truth: We are just dealing with pieces of paper here, pieces of paper backed up by nothing but the honesty and culture of the people who work at the company. 
When you put it that way, you realize how fragile this game can be. We have to believe that the system of checks and balances we have -- outside accountants, lawyers and the SEC -- can put enough pressure, honest pressure, on execs to keep them from doing the wrong thing. 
When they don't we have no clue of what we are buying. 
I keep thinking back to Cendant (CD:NYSE - news - commentary) , which collapsed three years ago when it turns out that one of the companies that made up Cendant was a bogus company: CU International. Who knew what the company was really worth if CU was a fraud? Who knew what the multiple might be? Who knew what the company was worth? Who knew how to value it? 
When you don't know, you don't average down. You sell. You ask questions later. 
That's what is going on with Enron right now, and it is freaking out everybody as Enron, while not a keystone of this market, was a core holding of outfits like Janus, Putnam, Citigroup, State Street and Fidelity. 
Anytime you get a stock that is widely held that loses billions in market capitalization overnight, whether it be Lucent (LU:NYSE - news - commentary) or Nortel (NT:NYSE - news - commentary) or Enron, you scare portfolio managers. When the selloff is exacerbated by fears of chicanery, it gets even worse. Enron's turning into the story that threatens to be a crossover, one that is doing more than just pulling down utilities. The market is about confidence. We have to have confidence that paper assets are backed up by something, even if it is the prestige and honor of executives. When that confidence is undermined in one major stock, it gets undermined in all. 
That's where we are right now.

Moody's downgrades Enron's debt
Enron asking banks for more credit 
Lisa Sanders
CBSMarketWatch.com
10/29/01
NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - Shares of Enron fell further Monday after Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enron's long-term debt a notch.
Enron, which hit a 52-week high of $84.88 on Dec. 29, was well on its way to another year low Monday. Heading for a ninth straight day of losses, Enron shed more than 9 percent, or $1.41, to $13.99. The stock was again the most active mover on the New York Stock Exchange as close to 28 million shares had changed hands.
Moody's said it cut the senior unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, and the ratings remain on review for potential additional downgrades. The action follows Enron's reported $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter and was driven by the expectation of further write-downs and the swift deterioration of the company's financial picture, said Stephen Moore, vice president at Moody's. 
""However, we do feel the move Enron made to draw down their revolvers to pay off their commercial paper was a smart business move,"" said Stephen Moore, vice president at Moody's. The rating agency said it would review the Prime-2 rating on Enron's commercial paper.
Last Thursday, Enron announced it had tapped its lines of credit to provide more than $1 billion in cash liquidity and that would it use $2 billion to pay down commercial paper.
The decision to pay off the commercial paper, he said, accomplishes two goals.
""It increases liquidity on a short-term basis, and additionally, it enables them to focus on other areas they need to focus on right now,"" Moore said. ""They are working on setting up an additional facility for further capital to support their wholesale trading business."" 
Karen Denne, an Enron spokesperson, confirmed Monday that the company is in discussions with banks for further financing. Additional credit would help boost Enron's liquidity position.
The lingering concern for Moody's is that there ""yet may be something else out there that gets to the credibility issue of Enron itself,"" Moore said. 
At the heart of the credibility issue are two limited partnerships -- LMJ and LMJ2 - created in 1999 by former CFO Andy Fastow and since dissolved. Enron ousted Fastow last week. See related story. </news/story.asp?guid=%7BFCA73BA9%2D55D0%2D4EE8%2DB6E7%2DBD924898CA4B%7D&siteid=mktw> ""The market was unaware,"" of the existence of the partnerships, Moore said.
""Quite frankly, we don't think there is anything else,"" he said. ""But Enron is huge, and if this could happen...there is a lingering concern that something else might happen. We cannot confirm or deny that this is true. We will be meeting soon with them to resolve issues such as these.""
Moore said the meeting could come as soon as this week.
""Should the wholesale trading business and the counterparties therein become impacted by these events, that could lead to the slowing growth of the wholesale business, the Enron engine,"" he said. 
Moody's action Monday also negatively affected the ratings on two trusts -- Marlin Water Trust and Osprey, which have combined debt of $3.2 billion. Marlin is now rated Baa2, while Osprey carries a new rating of Baa3, both down a notch.
The potential issue for the trusts may be ""how much equity Enron would have to issue if the sale of the underlying assets alone isn't enough to pay off the debt."" Enron is anticipating using the proceeds from the sale of assets to meet its obligation.

Enron Goes Begging 
Forbes.com staff, Forbes.com </news>, 10.29.01, 11:40 AM ET 

NEW YORK - Enron said this morning that it is in talks with banks for additional credit, as declining investor confidence sent its stock to a six-year low and several large energy groups put their dealings with Enron on hold. Last Thursday, the energy trader drew down about $3 billion from a credit line, causing its bonds to fall sharply on Friday. 

Enron (nyse: ENE ) has been scrambling to reassure investors and business partners since Oct. 16--after the company reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years. The $638 million loss included $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments. A week later, it disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives. Fastow was forced to step down from the company last week. 

The turmoil makes it clearer than ever that Enron's problems weren't solved by the recent departure of Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling.


In these challenging times, Enron deserves our thanks 
Houston Chronicle, October 28, 2001
By BILL WHITE 
Enron and its employees have blessed Houston, and many Houstonians should now take the time to say ""thanks"" when the company has experienced some highly publicized challenges. Enron attracted thousands of great people to Houston and changed Houston's economy forever. The company's management encouraged their employees to be active citizens, and those folks responded by making a big difference in their community. 
Enron's lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a multibillion-dollar new industry, with Houston as its hub. Even while it competed hard to win in the marketplace, Enron's example helped show other natural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger market of electricity. The downtown concentration of these firms -- industry leaders including Reliant, Dynegy, El Paso and Duke Energy -- led London's Financial Times to refer to Louisiana Street as the Wall Street of electricity. 
This explosive growth attracted bright young people -- with the average age of Enron employees at under 35 -- and they in turn helped fuel an explosion in residential growth in Houston's downtown. This, in turn, helped revitalize downtown's retail and restaurant scene. Enron's construction of a large Class A office tower, still going up, is a milestone in Houston's growth, an official end to more than a decade of large amounts of vacant office space. 
Virtually every civic or charitable activity in Houston learned to count on Enron for both financial support and thousands of hours of invaluable volunteer activities. If Enron or its chairman, Ken Lay, led a visionary effort, such as hosting the meeting of G7 trade ministers, or more recently the private funding of the Houston Biotechnology Center, Houstonians knew it would be done right. Without Lay our town would have lost major league baseball and status as a big league town. 
Employees know Enron set a standard for hiring and promoting employees based on their potential, with no glass ceilings. Women have run large divisions and subsidiaries. Many military officers find that Enron called on their talents after illustrious military careers, even at ages well past normal corporate entry level. The most highly recruited young people flock to a company that invests heavily in their training and then lets them rise as far and fast as their talent and ability to work hard would allow them. 
Enron's corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees who have lived the American dream. With the habits of work learned on a family farm in Missouri, Ken Lay got an education ending with a graduate degree at the University of Houston, served his country in government and began a career in the gas pipeline business. When Northern Natural Gas acquired the smaller Houston Natural Gas, Northern's chairman surprised folks by installing Lay as his successor. I was at Northern's headquarters in Omaha the week after the merger 16 years ago when Northern's chairman reassured folks that they could count on ""best young executive in the business, Ken Lay,"" to direct their future in a changing marketplace. Within 15 years, most of Enron's revenues and profits came from businesses that did not even exist when Lay had taken over, all of which had been created from within the firm. This success did not diminish the farm boy decency and sense of fairness that attracted top talent to his team. 
Enron rewarded innovation, while many firms afraid to alter the old formula wondered why their leadership eroded. Year after year, top executives throughout the country voted Enron our nation's most innovative corporation. Enron recognized, even when financial markets do not, that innovative firms are secure enough to accept occasional failure and the inevitable price of other successes. 
Rather than seeking insulation from the international marketplace, as had many American businesses, Enron welcomed the challenge of the international market, confident that American firms could compete and win. Enron also welcomed the challenge of responsible environmental stewardship, and called on industry to address the issue of global warming even as some companies feared the impact of pollution control on their bottom line. 
Enron's phenomenal success created incredible and perhaps unreasonable expectations, as early this year when the stock market valued the company based on 20 percent annual growth, forever. Enron's size and success made it a convenient target for politicians in California and India, even as Enron supplied the electricity they so needed. Sometimes it seemed the company's upstart origins as the David battling utility Goliaths delayed the firm's perception that it had won and no longer played the role of an underdog. 
And so if Enron experiences problems, it will learn from them, just as strong people do. Let's not prejudge Enron's current challenges. The more than a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies who hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but never to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story. 
Throughout its years of success, Enron folks have never forgotten to find so many ways to make the firm's hometown of Houston a better place to live and work. As Enron enters a new phase of its life, let's not forget to express thanks and steady support. 

White is a Houston business executive and civic leader and former government official, with no relationship to Enron.

"Fw: St. Dominic's","Oh, I guess the cost difference is not as great as I thought, but still about $700 per month more.  Do I need to run that by Jim to see if that is a deal breaker?  I will try to work on them at St. Dominic's but since they are just starting to open up this new wing they will probably be unwilling to deal.  I told Anne Rubio from St. Dominic's Center that you would be calling.  Her number is 713-741-8718.

My sense is that transportation to Symphony, AD Players, UH Chapel and lunch with Marshall Doyle will still be an issue that will have to handled outstide of St. Dominic's.  Their transportation is for shopping, group activities and doctor visits.  I want to follow up with additional questions on this subject, but that is my opinion at this point.  I have other questions for Anne as well so I will be in contact with her in the next several days.

Tom,
 
Thank you so much for handling this!  I did call Mom last night around 9:00 shortly before going to bed.  She did seem very happy with St. Dominic's Center.  Yes, the cost at Edenbrook is less than St. Dominic's Center...It costs $3500 + $750 for extra person...totally $4250/month. Bear in mind, this is for the two room living quarter, not a one room quarter with a connector door for another room.  Its probably St. Dominic's way of making money on the married couple!  I think that Mom and Dad's Long term Care Insurance covers at least $100/day if not a little more.  So this should help.  I hope to have an extra hour or two this Friday afternoon, perhaps to see the facilities myself. My big push at work should be over on Thursday afternoon.
 
I guess, I really don't care if it costs more to get Mom and Dad into an assisted living facility.  I just want to make sure it provides all the care that other facilities provide.
 
Love, Margaret

Margaret,
 
Mom, Dad and I had a nice visit to St. Dominic's Center.  It is full service retirement facility with independent living, assisted living and nursing/special care (including dementia).  As you expected it is not as luxurious as Edenbrook but it has good facilities and services, and most importantly both Mom and Dad like it.
 
I have several follow up questions based on reading their material and discussions today.  The biggest issue seems to be cost.  A one room suite is $80/day (approx. $2480/month) for assisted living which is good but the size is too small.  St. Dominics does not have two room units.  Mom and Dad can have two ajoining rooms which will give them lots of room but they will be charged the daily rate for each room or approx. $4960/month.  It does not seem right to me that they charge the full rate for two rooms since the service requirements for Mom and Dad is the same either way.  I understand they need to get value for the second room but 100% seems steep.  Lyne says that she and her mom encountered the same thought process with Lyne's grandmother when she wanted a private room versus a semiprivate room in a nursing care facility here in Houston.
 
Didn't you say that Edenbrook was about $4000/month for the two of them?
 
The other problem I see is that Dad seems to think he will have his car there.  Oh brother!!!!
 
I will give you a call after things slow down for you at work; will later this week be good for you?

"Texas General Land Office Mtg","Prior to the meeting with the Texas General Land Office I think it would be beneficial to have some one accumulate the following information:
	1)  What has the load profile for the Markets served by the Texas General Land Office look liked in the past?	  how does the load profile look now and how is the 		load profile expected to change in the future?					
	2)  If there is swing on an hour to hour basis during the day how will this be managed if HPL no longer provides the Storage service?
Before we make recommendations on how to solve their challenges I think we need to fully understand the services they provide to the various Texas institutions.

Enron Fights To Find Near-Term Sellers,But Still Trading

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) continued to struggle Tuesday to find willing sellers of near-term gas and power in North America, but the one-time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis, according to market sources. 
""It's not getting any better,"" said one major energy broker.
Many energy trading companies aren't selling to Enron and are only buying from it near-term. These include Aquila Inc. (ILA), Mirant (MIR), Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) subsidiary Coral Energy, Sempra Energy (SRE), and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's energy trading subsidiary, said the broker. The broker estimated Enron's over-the-counter trading volume to be about 25% of what it was a month ago. Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer. 
Some other companies, like Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and BP PLC. (BP), continue to trade with Enron fairly freely, the broker said. Dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron, though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated. The trading subsidiaries of troubled California utility-holding companies PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) also are trading with Enron. 
The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off-setting trades against deals done long ago. These include El Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Resources (RRI), Tractebel SA's (B.TRB) U.S. trading unit and regulated utilities, the broker said. 
Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than Enron was offering. 
""They've been cut off from so many people,"" said one electricity trader. 
Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions 

An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to 25% of the one-month-ago level. 
The notional value of Enron's 30-day rolling average of transactions is $2.8 billion, said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. Thode declined to give volume data for Tuesday or Monday, although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago. 
""We're not doing daily information. We're only speaking in terms of 30-day rolling averages. ... It's not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility,"" Thode said. 
Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to Enron's trading to restore confidence. But, after Enron's ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse Nov. 20, Dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed. 
Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt. 
But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. For the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies stopped selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing. 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's all rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit rating ""evolving."" Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings.

USA: UPDATE 3-Dynegy says in talks on Enron merger structure.
By C. Bryson Hull

11/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Energy trader Dynegy Inc. confirmed on Tuesday it was in talks with floundering rival Enron Corp. over their proposed merger, as sources familiar with the negotiations indicated the final buyout price may be slashed some 40 percent. 
""I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the deal,"" Dynegy spokesman John Sousa told Reuters. He declined to give further details.
Dynegy had planned to buy its Houston rival for $9 billion in stock and is currently in a ""due diligence"" examination of Enron's complex financial books that began before the Thanksgiving holiday last Thursday. 
The buyout offer, finalized Nov. 9, would have had Dynegy paying about $10.41 for each share of Enron, but Enron's shares have since cratered to near $4, stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned - if at all. 
The stock exchange ratio under discussion could fall from the originally proposed valuation of 0.2685 of each Dynegy share for each Enron share to around 0.15 instead, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Enron is willing to accept the lower valuation, given the pressure on its stock price, the sources said. 
Enron's shares bounced on Dynegy's confirmation of the restructuring talks, trading up 22 cents at $4.23 in late afternoon action on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had dipped as low as $3.84 in late-morning dealings and as high $4.49. Dynegy's shares gained 4.7 percent or $1.83 to move to $41.08 on the NYSE. 
Also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of Enron's debt past the close of the merger, expected in the third quarter of 2002. The sources said an announcement was possible on a new infusion of at least $500 million in cash, which Enron has said it was seeking. 
There also seemed to be an accord over who gets first crack at the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, which would be Dynegy's consolation prize if the deal fell apart, a source said. Published reports have said that investment banks J.P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney had already accepted the pipeline as collateral in other loans, and may dispute Dynegy's ownership if the deal breaks up. 
""The pipeline is far more valuable than what has already been collateralized. There's a solid earnings stream from that thing,"" said one source familiar with the discussions. 
ONE TRADING UNIT SHUT DOWN 
Two sources confirmed to Reuters that Enron's equity trading unit has been told it is being closed and that the roughly 60 employees there are being laid off. Enron was not immediately available for comment. 
Those layoffs, part of broader job cuts expected as part of the Dynegy buyout, point to an acute problem for Enron - the loss of volume in its premier trading franchise. Enron's trading partners have been cutting back transactions with North America's largest energy trader because of credit concerns. 
""This business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth. It is the principal reason that Dynegy is making the deal. If it's worth a lot less then Enron is worth less. It's vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business,"" said Commerzbank analyst Andre Meade. 
But as Enron's stock continued to lose value, down over 50 percent since Dynegy's initial bid, it seemed likely the purchase price would fall as well. Enron has seen its market capitalization drop to around $3 billion, from $60 billion at the start of 2001. (additional reporting by Jeff Goldfarb, Janet McGurty and Jonathan Stempel in New York).

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even if Dynegy Inc. (DYN) revises the terms of its acquisition of Enron Corp. (ENE), some takeover traders say the stock remains too risky. 
Earlier Tuesday, a Dynegy spokesman confirmed the company was in talks to restructure the Enron acquisition. Separately, a person familiar with the negotiations said the talks are centered on creating a package that includes a lower exchange ratio for Enron shareholders, a provision for additional funding for Enron, and the refinancing of Enron's existing debt.
Even with the boost Enron shares have received from the reports, they continue to trade at a sharp discount to the original deal's value. Enron shares recently traded at $4.30, up 29 cents, or 7.2%, while Dynegy shares changed hands at $41.50, up $2.25, or 5.8%. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy for each share outstanding, or $9.47 billion. At current trading levels, Enron shares are at a 61% discount to the offer price. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, Dynegy and Enron are contemplating an exchange ratio of less than 0.15 of a Dynegy share, or about $5.29 billion. 
The rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in Enron's ability to carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal moves toward completion, the person said. 
As the market waits for more details from the two companies, some say it will take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders, also known as arbitrageurs, with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion. 
Often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the acquiring company and buying shares of the target. In this way, the traders hope to profit as the target's share price moves toward the buyer's offer. 
But according to some traders, there is too much risk, even for those accustomed to uncertainty, to play the Dynegy-Enron deal in this way. 
Several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and potentially push Enron into bankruptcy. 
Enron's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to realize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into off-balance-sheet financing vehicles, including partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
""There's nothing like accounting to scare people,"" said one trader, who said there is still a perception in the market that there is more bad news yet to come from Enron.

NEW YORK (AFX0 - Dynegy Inc confirmed it is in talks with Enron Corp to renegotiate the terms of a deal with Dynegy Inc in an attempt to save their two week-old acquisition deal. 
""I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of a deal,"" Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said.
Enron, meanwhile, declined to comment on the report. 
Citing people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported that Enron Corp is in advanced talks with Dynegy to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40 pct to about 5 bln usd. 
Enron is also trying to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings to stem a growing liquidity crisis, the Wall Street Journal said.

STOCKWATCH Enron slightly higher on hopes for new deal price

11/27/2001

NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were slightly higher in midsession trade on reports that the company is trying to renegotiate the terms of a deal with Dynegy Inc, by cutting the price of the all-stock transaction to 5 bln usd, or 40 pct, from 9 bln usd, dealers said. 
At 12.19 pm, amid broad declines in the market, Enron shares were trading up 5 cents at 4.04 usd. Dynegy was up 1.26 usd, or 3.26 pct, at 40.51.
The DJIA was down 111.48 points at 9,871.28. The S&P 500 was down 10.40 points at 1,147.02. The Nasdaq composite was down 20.25 points at 1,920.98. 
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Enron was in advanced talks with Dynegy in an attempt to salvage their two week-old acquisition deal. The companies are discussing a new price for the all-paper deal, following the sharp fall in Enron's share price of the past few weeks. 
Enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that would calm investors -- the shares are trading at a small fraction of their record high last year of 87.50 usd. 
As of today, however, the revised deal still has not been formalised. 
The current agreement with Dynegy contains a ""material adverse change"" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
""Enron is a black hole, and I don't know how deep the bottom is,"" said Fadel Gheit an analyst at Fahnestock & Co. 
Only four weeks ago, Enron's stock was trading at the 8 usd mark, Gheit said, noting that if the Dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse. 
""The market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure, it could be several billion dollars,"" said Gheit. 
If the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stock-exchange ratio, said Gheit. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 share for each Enron share tendered. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would value Enron at less than 6 usd a share, or about 5 bln usd.

IN THE MONEY: Hedge Funds Say Yes To New Enron Terms
By Carol S. Remond

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- News that Enron Corp. (ENE) and would-be suitor and savior Dynegy Inc. (DYN) are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about Enron's fate.
And so far, even professional arbitrageurs, who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through, continue for the most part to stay clear of Enron's stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrounding the once mighty energy trader. 
Still, reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revised down to below 0.15 from 0.2685, has some hedge funds, often willing to take more risks, looking to place trades on the deal. 
""We're trying to figure out a good play,"" said a trader at a New York hedge fund. 
So far, bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combination of stock and debt trading, somehow hedging a short position on Enron's shares with a long position in some of its bonds. 
""People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it,"" a hedge fund manager at another fund said. This manager added, ""We're still trying to evaluate different risk/reward scenario on the debt and equity sides."" 
Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them later by purchasing them at a lower price. 
Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer, while taking long positions in the stock of the target company. But there is nothing typical about Enron's financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and large banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt market. ""Some bids are coming in, especially on the lower priced bonds,"" said a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enron's bonds. 
Enron bonds, which had fallen in value in recent weeks, gained five to seven points early Tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from Enron and Dynegy that their merger deal remains on track, albeit at a lower price. Enron's 6.4% bonds due 2004 were recently trading at about 55 cents on the dollar, up from 48 cents Monday. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron holders would have gotten 0.2685 of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares. Quoting people close to the discussions, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock. That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswires story last Friday. At current prices a 0.15 exchange ratio would value Enron at less than $6 a share. 
Essentially this new value, if true, means that it has now become easier for hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds. 
When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at $4 a share risked losing more than $6 if the merger went through at the 0.2685 ratio, it now stands to lose only $2 a share (based on the $6 value of Enron stock under the new 0.15 ratio). At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential by going long on Enron bonds. If the merger doesn't happen, Enron is seen by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of 0. That means that hedge funds shorting Enron at $4 stand to benefit by that amount. 
Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value of Enron bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about 80 cents on the dollar if it goes through. Meanwhile, the value of Enron stock is capped at about $6 a share if the merger goes through with a new conversion ratio of 0.15. 
""A lot of the guys are still very skeptical,"" said a bond trader at a New York bank. ""But this is really making the hedge trade easier and we've seen more customers short the stock and buy the bonds."" 
Still, this type of bets isn't for the faint of heart, and most investors are likely to wait for more news before taking a position. 
""We're nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now. But the situation is so volatile that it's difficult to be aggressive,"" the manager of a large New York hedge fund said.

Dynegy Confirms Talks On Enron Deal Structure - Source
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) confirmed the company is in talks with a number of parties regarding the structure of its transaction with Enron Corp. (ENE). 
""I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of the deal,"" said John Sousa. ""I can't elaborate any further at this time.""
An Enron official wasn't immediately to comment. 

Earlier Tuesday, a report in The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter who said Enron and Dynegy were in advanced discussions to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion. Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman, didn't comment on the newspaper report. 
Dynegy shares recently traded at $40, up 75 cents, or 1.9%, while Enron shares changed hands at $3.94, down 7 cents, or 1.7%. 
Under the original terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or $10.78, for each share outstanding, or about $9.14 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
According to the Journal report, the new terms could be below 0.15 of a Dynegy share. 
The deal is critical for Enron, which also simultaneously carrying out talks to receive between $500 million to $1 billion in additional funding to support its operations, while carrying on negotiations to restructure its debt, which totals about $13 billion. 
While Dynegy has already provided Enron with a cash infusion, it is uncertain how long Enron's current funds will allow it to remain solvent. 
Meanwhile, a third employee lawsuit has been filed against Enron over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of Enron's stock, which has declined more than 90% in the trailing 12 months. The suit claims Enron ""locked down"" the plan, which prevented employees from being able to sell the shares, and seeks $850 million for plan losses. 
Although the other recently filed employee suits didn't disclose the amount of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking, it is possible the suits seek a similar level of damages, a CreditSights report said. 
If this is true, the CreditSights report said, it is possible the clause that allows Dynegy to walk away from the deal if the liabilities from ""pending""' or ""threatened"" litigation may exceed $3.5 billion may be invoked. 
In addition, to the employee lawsuits, more than a dozen shareholder suits have been filed against Enron.

The discussions between Enron and Dynegy aren't merely focused on revising the consideration Dynegy will pay. They are also aimed at providing Enron with additional funding and at restructuring its debt, said a person familiar with the negotiations. 
The moves are aimed at restoring confidence in Enron and relieving ""the perceived liquidity crisis,"" the source said.

NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Shares of financially troubled energy trading giant Enron Corp. slipped back into the red on Tuesday after gaining in opening trade following news of a new rescue deal from Dynegy Inc. . 
Enron shares were down 2 cents at $3.99 after rising 19 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $4.20 in early dealings on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts questioned the viability of the original proposal for Dynegy to acquire Enron in a deal worth about $9 billion.

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says
2001-11-27 16:12 (New York)

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
will remain at ``Baa3,'' the lowest investment grade, by Moody's
Investors Service, which said it won't take any ratings action
today on the largest energy trading company.

     David Stimpson, Moody's managing director for ratings
communication, said although there was speculation in the market
that Moody's would make a ratings change, the company won't take
any action on Enron today. Stimpson declined further comment.

     Moody's had been expected to make a statement on Enron's
credit as bankers sought to raise as much as $2 billion for the
energy trader in private equity.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.



Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle
2001-11-27 15:16 (New York)

Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers,
seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, have
been turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal,
the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP.

     ``I was approached by several people to invest in the
company, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investor
from Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined
95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a good
investment, he said.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.

     The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing,
jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on its
stock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talks
between Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction
convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take
place.

     Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closed
yesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about
55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5
percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. The
stock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years.

                        Declining to Invest

     J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, plan
to provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billion
package. The bankers have been seeking additional investments,
which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for more
than two weeks.

     Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund that
invests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as Carlyle
Group and Blackstone have balked at investing, said people
familiar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined to
comment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``We
are not in discussions with Enron about financing.''

   ``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet,
which should reassure their trading partners,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the Strong
American Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of her
portfolio invested in Dynegy shares.

     Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger
over the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegy
is now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each of
Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less
than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people
close to the discussions.

                               Terms

     ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said
Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers
the energy market for Deutsche Bank.

     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of
Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about
Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would
be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst
who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''

    Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if
Enron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, an
analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBS
Warburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings
to 75 cents a share from $1.65.

     Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion of
payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion in
cash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised the
prospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's credit
rating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debt
repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

                           Cash Question

     ``The main question is: `What is the cash position right
now?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cash
position of the company stabilizing or not?''

     Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company
filed a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week announcing it had a $690 million note due
this week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from
lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million
credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he
was ``encouraged'' by the developments.



Liberty Funds Analyst Paik Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:56 (New York)


     Boston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Edward Paik, an analyst at
Liberty Funds Group, comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion acquisition of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Paik has Enron shares among the $3.6 billion in assets he
helps manage at Liberty.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday.

     ``The stock market is clearly 100 percent certain the Dynegy
deal won't go through as negotiated,'' Paik said. ``We're just
waiting.''

     ``If they announce they've renegotiated the deal, it will be
implicit that due diligence has been done, and that Dynegy won't
walk away for anything that's happened up until now. If they were
to impose more conditions, what good is that? Dynegy needs to
resuscitate Enron back to health.''



A.G. Edwards Analyst Heim Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:00 (New York)


     St. Louis, Missouri, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc. analyst Michael Heim comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Heim rates Enron ``sell'' and Dynegy ``hold'' and
doesn't own shares of either company.

     The market is waiting for confirmation and details of a
renegotiated bid, Heim said.

     ``We'd need to know why they'd agreed to a new price,'' Heim
said. ``It also needs to be combined with some sort of shoring up
of Enron's trading business, which needs to be stabilized for the
deal to have real value.''



Commerzbank Analyst Meade Comments on Dynegy's Talks With Enron
2001-11-27 10:42 (New York)


     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Commerzbank Securities
analyst Andre Meade comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Meade rates both companies ``hold'' and owns no shares.

     ``If they are renegotiating, it confirms our fears that
Enron's crown jewel, its marketing and trading business, is
deteriorating,''

      Investors are waiting for a sign on the state of the
business, Meade said.

      Enron's trading business was worth more than $10 billion
before partners began shunning it on credit concerns, Meade said.
A lower price struck by Dynegy may reveal how much business has
fallen, and whether Dynegy believes Enron can regain it, Meade
said.

     A New York Times report that banks may extend payments on
some loans until after Dynegy purchases Enron ``raises concern
that Dynegy will be hurt by taking on the vast liabilities of
Enron,'' Meade said.





ENRON SHARES RECOVER FROM A.M. SLUMP
By Lisa Sanders
CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:10 PM ET Nov 27, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Shares of Enron recovered from the morning's sub-$4
a share level Tuesday amid reports that the embattled energy merchant is
working with Dynegy to renegotiate its takeover offer.


Enron (ENE), which once hit $84.88 during the last holiday season,
added 13 cents to close at $4.14 on volume of 68.4 million shares. The
stock was the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange
Tuesday.

Dynegy shares added $1.64 to close at $40.89.

The New York Times reported that Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) and Enron
are renegotiating Dynegy's bid, once valued at $9 billion in stock.
According to the report, Dynegy is worried that Enron's core business --
energy trading -- is deteriorating. See full story.



Getting it done

_______________________________________________________________________

Glen Hilton, portfolio manager of the Montgomery New Power Fund, said
it's a ""crapshoot"" as to whether the deal gets done.

""I think that regardless of the outcome Dynegy is still in a good
position for the long-term,"" he said. His fund liquidated its Enron
holdings completely in mid to late-October. ""Enron was the leader (in
energy trading), and it's clearly suffering so Dynegy is in a good shot
to take up the mantle.""

Hilton pointed to Enron's 10-Q, filed last Monday with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, and the falling share price as potential
triggers of the deal's material adverse affect clause. Those two things
could very well make Dynegy walk away from the merger. If that happens,
Hilton said, an Enron bankruptcy is a very real possibility.

""Very few companies understand what Enron does and Dynegy is one of the
few that could make something out of it,"" Hilton said. ""If Dynegy can
restore confidence in Enron's trading business and get Northern Natural
Gas, it looks like it might be worth the headache.""

Dynegy has the rights to Enron's Northern Natural Gas, a pipeline
system, whether the merger goes through or not.

Enron wasn't immediately available for comment. Dynegy, through a
company spokesman, confirmed that it was in discussions with ""the
parties involved in the transaction"" related to the structure of the
deal.



Top Of The News 
Enron In Free Fall 
Dan Ackman <javascript:newWindow('Ackman')>, Forbes.com <http://www.forbes.com/news>, 11.27.01, 9:00 AM ET 

NEW YORK - If not for Sept. 11, Enron would be a major scandal; as it stands, it's a minor scandal. The Houston-based energy company, whose Chairman Kenneth Lay is a personal friend of and top fundraiser for President George W. Bush <http://www.forbes.com/2001/10/12/gwbush.html> and Vice President Dick Cheney, is in free fall. The bailout by rival Dynegy made public three weeks ago appears to be unraveling. 

Dynegy's (nyse: DYN <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=DYN> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=DYN> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=DYN>) buyout of Enron (nyse: ENE <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=ENE> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=ENE> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=ENE>) was originally valued at $9 billion. But just as the deal was announced, Enron said its prior financial reporting was inaccurate and that it had overstated earnings by $586 million over the past four years. 

While the companies have not said the merger is off, investors don't believe it will happen, at least not at the stated price; they have bid Enron shares down to the point where the company has a market value of less than $3 billion. The shares closed yesterday at $4.01, down from $78 a year ago. 

The situation is in flux, as it has been for months. During that time, several top Enron executives have been forced to resign. Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive officer, left in August for ""personal reasons."" 

Company officials said they hope to announce, perhaps as early as today, a series of changes: a lower price for the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 million; new, extended loan terms by Enron's bankers; and somehow, an agreement that prevents Dynegy from walking away in the face of litigation over Enron's devastated employee-retirement plan. Lawsuits by shareholders are sure to follow, considering Enron's restatement and the pay it lavished on executives, including Lay who received $135 million from salary, bonus and the exercise of stock options in 2000 alone. 

For now, Dynegy says it still wants to do a deal for its crosstown rival with 2000 revenue of $101 billion. 

Even more alarming than the deterioration in the share price is the crisis of confidence in Enron's reliability as a trading partner in worldwide energy markets. Last year, Enron was the dominant player in natural gas and electricity trading--a fast-paced, complex business quite removed from the company's history as a gas- and oil-pipeline builder and operator. The fear now is that other companies will refuse to trade with Enron out of trepidation that it will file for bankruptcy and not pay its bills. 

The company had $10.5 billion in debt as of its last annual report, and that number has likely grown by 20%. Already, credit agencies have cut their ratings on Enron debt. 

Dynegy and its partner, ChevronTexaco (nyse: CVX <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=CVX> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=CVX> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=CVX>), may pump billions of dollars into Enron's operations if the purchase goes through. But the deal will certainly undergo regulatory scrutiny and will take months to close. Investors and energy traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang on by itself. 

Enron bills itself as one of the world's leading energy, commodities and services companies. It says it ""markets electricity and natural gas, delivers energy and other physical commodities, and provides financial and risk management services to customers around the world."" While all this may be true, its popularity with investors was based largely on its fast-growing revenue--much like the Internet companies whose collapse it mirrors. 

Few shareholders had any understanding of what Enron did to generate that revenue, and indeed Enron's own auditors at Arthur Andersen were confused. Most of the revenue was generated from trading, but the company's shares sold as if it was still an industrial company and not a financial firm. 

Enron was famous for being famous. Before the start of the 2000 baseball season, it purchased the rights to have its name on Houston's new ballpark. By 2002, Enron Field may need a new name. 

The name Enron itself sounds like it has something to do with energy, but it means nothing. At the time the company was formed from the merger of InterNorth of Omaha and Houston Natural Gas, the idea was to call the company Enteron. But the namers then looked in the dictionary and found out that Enteron means ""intestines;"" they decided to drop the ""te"" in the middle and go with Enron. Soon Enron may be part of Dynegy, a much smaller company in terms of revenue. If the deal falls apart, it may want to go back to Enteron.

Enron Names Jeff McMahon Chief Financial Officer

HOUSTON, Oct 24, 2001 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) announced today that it has named Jeff McMahon chief financial officer. McMahon had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group. From 1998 to 2000, McMahon was Enron's treasurer. 
""Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron,"" said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and CEO. ""He has the trust and confidence of our investors and financial institutions."" 
Andrew Fastow, previously Enron's CFO, will be on a leave of absence from the company. ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Lay said. 
McMahon, 40, joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations. Upon returning to the United States, McMahon was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp. In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works, where he had responsibility for Enron's e-commerce activities. 
McMahon has a bachelor's degree in business from the University of Richmond in Virginia. He is a Certified Public Accountant, SFA registered and is a member of the American Institute of Public Accountants and Association of Corporate Treasurers.

Secretaries Say Enron Had Them Pose As Traders In 1998
By Jason Leopold

02/06/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Some current and former employees of Enron Energy Services, the retail energy unit of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), say the company asked them to pose as busy electricity and natural gas sales representatives one day in 1998 so the Enron unit could impress Wall Street analysts visiting its Houston headquarters.
More than a dozen former and current Enron Energy Services staff who spoke to Dow Jones Newswires said Enron executives rushed about 75 employees, including secretaries and actual sales representatives, down to an empty trading floor on the sixth floor and told them to act as if they were trying to sell energy contracts to businesses over the phone. 
""When we went down to the sixth floor, I remember we had to take the stairs so the analysts wouldn't see us,"" said Kim Garcia, who at the time was an administrative assistant for Enron Energy Services and was laid off last December. ""We brought some of our personal stuff, like pictures, to make it look like the area was lived in. There were a bunch of trading desks on the sixth floor, but the desks were totally empty. Some of the computers didn't even work, so we worked off of our laptops. When the analysts arrived, we had to make believe we were on the phone buying and selling electricity and natural gas. The whole thing took like 10 minutes."" 
Penny Marksberry - who also worked as an Enron Energy Services administrative assistant in 1998 and was laid off last December - and two employees who still work at the unit also said they were told to act as if they were trying to sell contracts. 
""They actually brought in computers and phones and they told us to act like we were typing or talking on the phone when the analysts were walking through,"" Marksberry said. ""They told us it was very important for us to make a good impression and if the analysts saw that the operation was disorganized, they wouldn't give the company a good rating."" 

Enron Confirms Employees Moved 

Peggy Mahoney, Enron Energy Services' spokeswoman, confirmed that some employees were told to move to sixth floor so it would appear to be occupied and busy for a visit by 150 analysts from Wall Street firms who were in town for a convention. 
But she said it was just a handful of employees who went down to the sixth floor, not 75, and that the company didn't ask anyone to pose as traders or sales representatives. 
""We weren't trying to mislead anyone,"" Mahoney said. ""There were some employees who were moved down there. They were told to just sit there. I don't know why. Analysts were brought in, and we showed them our operation. We were just showing them how we structured deals and contracts."" 
Mahoney couldn't confirm the exact date of the analyst visit, but said it happened as the unit was in the middle of signing a contract with General Cable. Enron announced that deal on June 30, 1998. 
One analyst based in Houston recalled the visit to Enron's headquarters, where analysts were bused following a meeting at the Four Seasons hotel in June 1998. Analysts were led around by Ken Lay, then Enron's chairman and chief executive, and the EES floor appeared busy with actual work, he said. 
""The big push then was EES and retail electricity in California,"" the analyst said, asking that his name be withheld because his bank still conducts business with Enron. ""The trading floor looked fully staffed. There was a presentation in a little auditorium right where EES was operating. It looked like people were very busy. We didn't interact with any of the employees on the floor."" 
A number of the other analysts currently covering Enron weren't following the company in 1998. Of those that were, some didn't recall the specific company visit or weren't available for comment. 

Need To Show 'Warm Bodies Working' 

Enron Energy Services was set up in late 1997 to sell energy and advisory services to large consumers that had been freed or were expected to be freed from their local utilities by newly minted deregulation laws. 
The unit was still small in 1998. Some of its employees shared space with other units on the ninth floor, and others were spread throughout the building while the sixth floor was being fashioned as a permanent home, employees said. 
Enron executives including Lay escorted the analysts through the floor and returned later to tell the employees that they had done a good job, said Garcia, the administrative assistant. 
""I think a bunch of us asked him why did we just do this, and he said the analysts needed to see a bunch of warm bodies working so Enron could get a good credit rating,"" Garcia said. ""He said the trading part of Enron was the company's bread and butter."" 
Earl Silbert, a lawyer representing Lay, declined to comment specifically on the employees' claims, saying they didn't deserve a response. 
Last week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee released a memo e-mailed to Lay in August 2001 warning that Enron Energy Services' financial results were being misrepresented. The memo was sent by Margaret Ceconi, who worked for the unit for nine months. 
Mahoney said at the time the memo ""does not represent all the facts."" 
A bankruptcy court judge allowed Enron to drop hundreds of Energy Service contracts, but the company has taken extraordinary measures to keep many of the remaining deals alive, an indication many of the unit's contracts remain profitable.

USA: Substantial illegal Enron activity found-Tauzin.

02/06/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Congressional investigators have uncovered ""substantial evidence of illegal activity"" by the now-bankrupt Enron Corp. and its management, Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said on Wednesday. 
""This activity served to deceive the public about Enron's financial condition,"" Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican, said in prepared remarks opening a hearing to probe the collapse of the former energy giant and the actions by its auditor Andersen.
Enron's auditor ""knew or should have discovered the fraudulent nature"" of certain transactions with outside partnerships managed by former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, he said. 
""We have found that Enron's financial statements violated numerous existing accounting rules,"" Tauzin said.

FASB To Discuss Off-Balance-Sheet Entities Next Week

02/06/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The Financial Accounting Standards Board plans to discuss the issue of accounting for a controversial type of off-balance-sheet entity at its Feb. 13 meeting, the board said Wednesday. 
In the schedule for the meeting, the accounting rulemaker said it will discuss issues related to identifying and accounting for ""special-purpose entities,"" or SPEs - partnerships which currently don't have to be consolidated with the rest of a company's balance sheet even though the company may have effective control over them.
The board said it ""will consider various approaches to dealing with SPE situations"" and will consider expanding its work to address accounting and disclosure by ""the issuer of guarantees of the indebtedness of others."" 
The issue of accounting for SPEs has come to the fore because of their prominent role in the Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) scandal. Enron used SPEs, some controlled by its own executives, to move assets and debt off its balance sheet and thus improve its financial results; the now-bankrupt company later reconsolidated some of the SPEs into its balance sheet, which reduced its previously reported earnings by $586 million. 
Companies can form non-consolidated SPEs apart from their balance sheets even though outside investors might provide as little as 3% of the entities' capitalization. The FASB has tried for years to tighten the requirements for when such entities should be consolidated with the rest of companies' operations, but in the past companies have successfully fought any changes. 
The FASB has said it hopes to release new draft rules for accounting for SPEs this spring.

US Rep Tauzin says Congress has learned 'of theft by insiders' at Enron

02/06/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Billy Tauzin said his committee's investigation of Enron Corp has now uncovered ""self-dealing transactions"" by senior Enron management, violations of securities laws as well as ""theft by insiders"". 
Tauzin revealed the findings in a committee hearing which is investigating Enron's collapse.
""In the end, it turns out that the Enron debacle is an old-fashioned example of theft by insiders, and a failure by those responsible for them to prevent that theft,"" Tauzin said. 
In a list of new findings, the committee has found that senior Enron executives engaged in self-dealing transactions. 
The committe said that company executives reported ""fictitious gains"" on partnerships controlled by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow and others associated with the company, which helped to artificially pump up Enron's stock price and ""allowed the same executives to enrich themselves with sales of Enron stock."" 
The committee findings also levelled significant criticism at former Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP. 
""We have also found that Enron's auditor, Andersen, knew or should have discovered the fraudulent nature of the Fastow transactions,"" Tauzin said, adding that these transactions ""clearly violated existing law and the most basic norms of corporate behaviour."" 
The committee has subpoenaed Fastow to appear tomorrow to give evidence on his role in Enron's collapse. But committee staff said they expect the former Enron executive to plead the fifth amendment, which would prevent him from answering questions that could incriminate himself.

UBS to Start Energy Trading Soon After Hiring Enron Workers
2002-02-06 13:32 (New York)

     New York, Feb. 6 (Bloomberg) -- UBS AG said it expects to complete this week its purchase of Enron Corp.'s energy trading business, which will resume electricity and natural gas transactions that all but dried up after Enron's bankruptcy.
     About 625 Enron traders, technicians and back-office workers are preparing to buy and sell energy contracts for UBS, though no date has been set, UBS spokesman David Walker said. Enron traders have been contacting former customers and lining up credit agreements that UBS will need to complete transactions.
     The energy-trading business won't come close to equaling the $43.4 billion in revenue it generated for Enron in the third quarter, before its collapse, Enron traders said. Many customers were burned by the Dec. 2 bankruptcy and have since taken their business to competitors such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc.
     ""It's going to be an uphill battle to build confidence,'' said Jim Walker, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ""The market's already operating fairly efficiently. It will be a challenge to offer better deals (than Intercontinental) and still make a living.''
     The move to UBS has revived morale for the Enron traders, who watched as 4,500 of their fellow employees at the company's Houston headquarters lost their jobs shortly after the bankruptcy filing, which was the largest ever.
     ""We're all excited about moving on from the whole Enron thing, and that we'll be back trading soon,'' said Tom Martin, director of Texas natural gas trading at Enron. ""It'll take some time for people to get used to doing business with us. I'm sure there will be some residual effects of what happened at Enron.''

Bankruptcy Sale

     UBS won a bankruptcy auction for Enron's dormant trading business in January. Under the bid, which was approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge on Jan. 18, UBS would pay Enron a royalty of 33 percent of pretax profit from the trading business. UBS also agreed to pay $5 million of the $11 million in retention bonuses promised to Enron's gas and power employees.
     ""We expect the deal to close by the end of the week,'' said David Walker, the UBS spokesman. The energy-trading business, which will be based in Houston and called UBS Warburg Energy, ""should be up and running soon afterward.''
     Shares of UBS, a Switzerland's largest banks, fell 1.85 Swiss francs to 73 francs ($43.10). The stock is down 12 percent since Jan. 11, when UBS submitted the highest bid for Enron's energy- trading business.
     The royalties may be worth $1 billion to $2 billion to Enron over the next several years, according to Blackstone Group LP, a private merchant-banking firm hired to help Enron restructure while it tries to emerge from bankruptcy. The liquidation value of the business would have been less than $50 million, the firm estimated.

Enron Obligations

     Some creditors' groups had argued that UBS's bid would force Enron to bear a disproportionate share of the cost and risk of getting the trading business going again.
     There was no guarantee that other energy-trading firms would want to do business with the new entity, Dallas-based bankruptcy lawyer David M. Bennett, who represents a group of creditors, said at the bankruptcy hearing.
     As of Sept. 30, banks, utilities and power companies were owed more than $19 billion by Enron in past trades and contracts for future commodity deliveries, according to Standard & Poor's.
     With so much money still owed them, some companies may be reluctant to do business with Enron's successor, even with a new name and the backing of UBS, said Jim Walker, the analyst at Forrester Research.
     Enron's former trading partners also have gotten used to trading elsewhere.

Rivals Gain

     Officials at the Intercontinental Exchange say trading has doubled in its markets to a nominal value of $4 billion a day in the past three months, fueled partly by transactions from former Enron customers. Intercontinental, based in Atlanta, is owned by companies such as BP Plc, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and American Electric Power Co.
     To convince traders to return, UBS will have to offer higher prices for sellers and lower prices for buyers than its rivals, which would keep profits thin, Forrester's Walker said.
     In some ways, UBS will be starting with a fresh slate. Enron's book of energy contracts, many of which have been canceled and written off as losses by its trading partners, belongs to the Enron estate, said Martin, the former Enron trader who will be moving to UBS.
     Martin has been spending some of his time in the past week contacting former customers about setting up credit agreements with UBS.

No Enron Link

     ""After a short period of time people will realize we have nothing to do with Enron,'' he said. ""We won't be as big a player as we were, but I think we can get to be a pretty significant player'' during the next six months to a year.
     Enron's energy-trading unit was profitable before the bankruptcy and wasn't responsible for the company's downfall, Martin said.
     Enron used special partnerships controlled by its executives to keep debt off its books, which helped hide losses in other businesses, according to company officials, government documents and congressional investigators.

Enron's Lay Told Investigators He Felt 'Betrayed'
2002-02-06 14:45 (New York)

     Washington, Feb. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay told investigators for the company's board that senior executives had ""betrayed'' him in setting up partnerships that hid the energy trader's debt.
     Lay, who denied to investigators any criminal wrongdoing, said he gave former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow too much leeway in creating the partnerships, said William Powers, head of the board committee that on Saturday released a report about Enron's collapse.
     ""He felt he had not been watching carefully enough,'' Powers told a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee yesterday. ""He felt he had been betrayed.''
     Lawmakers questioned Powers in an attempt to piece together who contributed to Enron's Dec. 2 filing of the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history and wiping out the retirement savings of thousands of employees. Power repeated the conclusions of his report, which blamed everyone from Lay to the board of directors and Arthur Andersen LLP for not questioning partnerships that concealed more than $1 billion in losses.
     ""The tragic consequences of the related-party transactions and accounting errors were the result of failures at many levels and by many people,'' according to a summary of the report. The Enron culture ""appears to have encouraged pushing the limits.''

Aggressive Style

     In his testimony, Powers said Fastow's aggressive style cowed other executives into approving partnerships from which he made $30 million.
     ""They were unwilling to stand up to Andy Fastow,'' he said.
     Powers was appointed as an Enron director in November to lead an investigation at the board's request. He told the committee he expects to leave the board.
     The House Energy and Commerce Committee is subpoenaing Fastow and Michael Kopper, a former Enron executive involved in the partnerships, to appear tomorrow on Capitol Hill, said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the panel, which is overseeing one of 10 congressional investigations. Fastow and Kopper are expected to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and not testify, he said.
     Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned as chief executive in August, is expected to answer the panel's questions, Johnson said.
     The committee is seeking to have Lay testify before the end of the month, Johnson said. Two other congressional panels have issued subpoenas to Lay after he canceled an appearance set for Monday, citing prejudicial comments from lawmakers.
     The commerce panel voted today to give its chairman, Representative Billy Tauzin, broad authority to subpoena any other executive of Enron or Andersen during the investigation into Enron's collapse.
     The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department also are looking into what happened at Enron as more lawmakers said that executives probably broke the law.
     ""It's an old story,'' Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican, said yesterday. ``It's a story of inside theft.''

Labor secretary testifies at Enron hearings 
By MARCY GORDON 
Associated Press 
Feb. 6, 2002, 11:24AM
WASHINGTON -- Responding to the Enron collapse, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao today told Congress that President Bush's proposal to revamp pension laws would strengthen retirement account protections for millions of workers. 
Bush is asking Congress give workers greater flexibility to diversify their company savings accounts, aiming to prevent another Enron-style meltdown. Thousands of Enron employees lost their retirement savings as the company stock plummeted and they were barred from selling it from their investment accounts. 
""We must strengthen the confidence of the American workforce that their retirement savings are secure,"" Chao testified at a hearing by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. ""We must accomplish this without unnecessarily limiting employers' willingness to establish and maintain plans for their workers or employees' freedom to direct their own savings."" 
Although some changes in pension laws are needed, the system is not irreparably broken and is in fact a great success story, Chao said. 
The president's plan also would require employers to give workers quarterly statements with detailed information on their accounts and their rights to diversify holdings, Chao noted. 
Chao spoke as subpoenas multiplied and hearings mushroomed in Congress' investigation into the collapse of Enron Corp., a once-powerful company transformed into a symbol of corporate failure. 
Across the Capitol, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from legal and labor experts on how to prevent similar future scandals. Proposals included requiring more disclosure from accountants and capping the amount of money that bankrupt corporations can shield from creditors. 
Such changes would require vast revisions to bankruptcy and other laws, and there was disagreement early in the hearing over how best to do that. ""You can't legislate against greed, but you can stop greed from succeeding,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the panel's chairman. 
Washington state Attorney General Christine Gregoire told the panel that Enron's conduct amounted to ""a perfect storm"" that rained financial loss and fraud on thousands of investors. 
""They assumed the seventh largest company in America was playing by the rules,"" Gregoire said. ""In the end, they found themselves ripped off just like the naive person who lost money in a pyramid scheme."" 
At the hearing on pension law changes, Rep. George Miller of California, the committee's senior Democrat, said the Enron case shows how workers' retirement savings can be jeopardized if employees' rights and protections are inadequate. ""Today's outdated pension rules are putting employee nest eggs at risk,"" he said. 
Enron's human resources executives have said employees were frozen out of their accounts for 11 trading days while the company switched 401(k) plan administrators. 
As the lockout period approached and Enron's stock continued to plummet, Enron managers considered delaying the switch and the lockout period so employees would not be frozen out of their accounts. 
""We considered postponing, but found it was not feasible to notify more than 20,000 participants in a timely fashion,"" Mikie Rath, Enron's benefits manager, told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Tuesday. 
An employee ""told me my timing was horrible, which I agreed with,"" Rath said. 
Enron's stock peaked at $82 a share on Jan. 26, 2001. It was selling for $15.40 at the close of trading on Oct. 26, the day the lockout began, and had fallen to $9.98 on Nov. 13, the day it ended. 
A dozen committees are investigating Enron, along with the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission. The energy-trading company has deep political ties in Washington, and politicians in both parties have scrambled to distance themselves from Enron. 


Chao: US Pension Laws Need Reform; Warns Of Going Too Far
By Jennifer Corbett Dooren

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Labor Secretary Elaine Chao Wednesday told Congress the collapse of Enron highlights the need to update the nation's pension laws but warned of going too far.
In testimony before the House Education and Workforce Committee, Chao said Enron's collapse has ""revealed the need for stronger safeguards to protect workers."" 
Enron's stock price sharply fell last year before the firm filed for bankruptcy protection in December, wiping out much of the retirement savings of the company's workers. 
But, Chao said, approving legislation that would limit the amount of employer stock that can be placed in workers' 401(k) and other retirement accounts was a bad idea. 
""While it may be tempting to go down this road in the wake of recent business failures, this would actually take away from workers the right to choose, which they deserve,"" she said. ""Arbitrary limits on workers' investment choices would not be progress; it would be turning back the clock."" 
Instead, Chao urged Congress to approve legislation incorporating the plan outlined last week by President George W. Bush designed to update the 1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act. 
The Bush administration and lawmakers agree the law known as ERISA needs updating because it was primarily designed to cover pension plans in which the employer controlled the investments. While some firms still offer such traditional pension plans, most companies offer workers 401(k) and other retirement plans in which the employee is primarily responsible for investment decisions. More than 42 million Americans have 401(k) retirement plans. 
The Bush plan would require employers to offer their employees impartial investment advice, allow employers to sell company stock after three years, subject company executives to the same so-called blackout periods as employees, and require companies to give employees quarterly statements of retirement plan performances. 
Most lawmakers agree that employees need better access to investment advice, which would highlight the need to ensure that retirement assets are diversified. More than 60% of Enron's 401(k) assets were invested in Enron stock as is common for many large companies. Enron, like many companies, gave employees matching contributions in the form of stock. However, Enron employees were required to hold on to the stock until age 50. Many Enron executives had a different arrangement, allowing them to sell their stock sooner. 
However, lawmakers are divided on whether to cap the amount of employer stock that can be placed in retirement plans. 
A bill by Sens. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Jon Corzine, D-N.J., for example, would place a 20% cap on the amount of employer stock that can be placed in employee retirement plans. 
Rep. George Miller, of California, the top Democrat on the House Education panel, said it was imperative that Congress act to update pension laws in order to restore investor confidence, noting the recent turmoil in the stock market over company accounting practices. 
""We've told millions of Americans that this is the road to security,"" Miller said of 401(k) plans. ""We've just hit a huge bump in the road."" 
Miller has introduced legislation similar to the Bush plan but it would only require employees to hold company stock for one year before they could sell it rather than three years as Bush suggested.

UK: No quick sale for Enron's UK power station stake.
By Matthew Jones

02/06/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Future ownership of Enron's most valuable physical asset in Europe, the UK Teesside power station, remained in the balance on Wednesday as its co-owners struggled to unravel contractual issues surrounding the bankrupt U.S. energy company's 250 million pound ($353.5 million) stake. 
Enron's partners in the 1,875 megawatt power station are in talks with their banks in an effort to clarify the complex supply contract and ownership issues left when Enron, which operated the plant, went bankrupt in late November.
""It could take months before the situation is resolved,"" said a spokeswoman for GPU Power, one of Enron's partners in Teesside, the first independent power station built in the UK after electricity privatisation in the early 1990s. 
""We are currently in talks with the other partners and with the banks,"" she said. 
Enron Europe went into administration in November as a financial scandal overwhelmed its Houston-based parent and administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) this week said Enron Europe owed ""billions"" of dollars in losing positions on power and gas trading contracts. 
Enron's 42.5 percent stake in Teesside is probably the collapsed company's most valuable physical asset in Europe, where the bulk of its business was based on trading in energy and commodities. 
Industry sources believe Enron's equity in Teesside, the largest combined cycle plant of its kind in Europe, is likely to be sold to one of its existing partners in the venture. The complex ownership structure is likely to discourage outside bidders. 
""There is no formal process to seek outside bids,"" a spokeswoman for Enron said. 
She said Enron's partners in Teesside - Midland Power International (GPU Power), Northern Electric owned by MidAmerican Energy and itself part of Berkshire Hathaway , and Western Power Distribution - have first call on whether to acquire Enron's stake. 
ONE STAKE HOLDER NOT INTERESTED 
So far none have declared an interest in doing so. Western Power Distribution said it does not want to extend its 15.4 percent stake in the venture. 
""We are a distributor, not a generator and we are not interested in expanding our generation at Teesside,"" a company spokesman said. 
Western Power's stance is unsurprising given the current high cost of UK gas set against electricity prices which are at 10-year lows. 
Before Enron's collapse the group's stake in Teesside was valued at about 250 million pounds thanks in part to Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) - contracts to sell power at a set price - which currently provide a steady revenue stream. 
The PPAs are understood to be favourable to the power station since Innogy paid 391 million pounds to get out of the contract it acquired when it bought the supply side business of MEB. 
The Teesside station is run by Teesside Power Limited, of which Teesside Power Holdings has a 50 percent share. 
Enron itself has 85 percent control of Teesside Power Holdings, with Midlands Power International holding the remaining 15 percent. 
Of the other 50 percent of Teesside Power Limited, Midlands Power has 19.2 percent, Northern Electric 15.4 percent and Western Power Distribution 15.4 percent.

Enron's Creditors' Group Setting Stage for Lawsuit Against Andersen
By Kathy Chu

02/06/2002
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
NEW YORK -- Arthur Andersen LLP's mountain of legal troubles could get a little higher.
Andersen, which is already dealing with a slew of shareholder lawsuits over its relationship with Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), may be slapped with more litigation in the coming weeks -- this time, by Enron's creditors' committee, according to people familiar with the matter. 
The committee didn't return repeated phone calls seeking comment. But Martin Bienenstock, an attorney who represents Enron and deals with the committee extensively, said, ""It's more likely than not"" that a lawsuit will be filed. ""It's not a question of whether, it's a question of when."" 
Andersen didn't return repeated calls seeking comment. 
The lawsuit, always considered a possibility in the legal proceedings, would come on the heels of the Powers report, the three-month internal Enron investigation led by William C. Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school. The report criticized Andersen for failing to give Enron ""objective and critical professional advice."" 
As a result, the creditors' committee now has more ammunition to use against Andersen, experts said. 
""[The committee] almost has a duty to pursue this,"" said Nancy D. Rapoport, dean of the University of Houston Law Center. ""There's enough in the Powers report that people are going to wonder why, if it doesn't happen."" 
In the meantime, the committee is still gathering information. The group is getting ready to subpoena key financial documents and depose select auditing executives. 
A federal bankruptcy judge Tuesday granted the committee's request for an in-depth examination of Andersen, which, according to a court filing, will be given 20 days notice from the time the subpoena is issued to produce documents and 30 days notice before executives are deposed. 
The information gleaned from Andersen over the next few weeks will likely be used as fodder in any potential lawsuit against the auditors. Such a lawsuit could allege fraud and negligence by Andersen related to the firm's advice about the risk associated with Enron's off-balance-sheet transactions and how that risk should be managed, according to bankruptcy experts. 
In court documents filed with the New York bankruptcy court in late December, the creditors' committee said a ""complete examination"" of Andersen would shed light on the ""accounting irregularities disclosed by Enron and the resulting financial implication that in part precipitated the bankruptcy filing ..."" 
The extensive documents requested by the group range from routine auditing paperwork to more detailed e-mails and computer disks. But it is the demand for Andersen's ""internal manuals, statements of policies and procedures,"" and ""documents referring to, describing, suggesting or alleging possible violations of professional standards in the services Andersen provided to Enron"" that suggest the committee isn't just trying to piece together the details of Enron's collapse. 
Rather, the committee seems to be trying to establish a case against Andersen, and recoup for creditors some of the millions it paid the auditing firm, bankruptcy experts said. 
Enron, for its part, plans to steer clear of the committee's deliberations. ""We told the creditors' committee at the outset that we would allow the creditors group to take the legal action -- when or whether it was necessary,"" said Mr. Bienenstock. ""They may still be investigating the facts."" 
A lawsuit against Andersen by the committee would come as little surprise to bankruptcy experts. ""It's not unheard of by any stretch,"" said Margaret Howard, the scholar-in-residence at the American Bankruptcy Institute, a nonprofit think tank in Alexandria, Va. 
But it could be an uphill, and costly, legal battle. In cases where a creditors' committee or trustee have sued a company's auditors or lawyers, the plaintiffs are usually left with substantial legal fees and a disappointing ruling. That is partly because it's difficult to establish a third party's responsibility for a company's actions, say experts. 
But because Enron's bankruptcy is the largest and possibly the most complex in corporate history, little precedent exists for this type of lawsuit. ""It's really going to come down to the quality of the facts and the quality of the lawyers,"" said Ms. Rapoport. ""[The committee] doesn't have to have a slam-dunk case. They only have to be 51% right.""

US lawmakers, SEC's Pitt to unveil binding new rules for Wall St analysts

02/06/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - House lawmakers together with Securities & Exchange Commission chairman Harvey Pitt and executives of the National Association of Securities Dealers plan to unveil a range of new rules tomorrow governing Wall Street financial analysts' conduct. 
The binding new rules, details of which have yet to be fully released, will make Wall Street analysts subject to strong oversight and enforcement in order to boost their independence and stock recommendations, according to a statement from the House Capital Markets subcommittee.
""These people are professionals and should be held to professional standards, especially because what they do has direct bearing on the lives and livelihoods of so many average Americans,"" said subcommittee chairman Richard Baker. 
Baker said the rules will ""protect unsuspecting minnows from irresponsible and self-serving sharks... rebuild Chinese Walls, and usher in dramatic changes in financial sector governance, oversight, disclosure, and responsibility."" 
The subcommittee chairman convened a blue ribbon panel of academic experts last year to come up with a range of new rules to reform analysts' independence following a series of hearings which uncovered instances of analysts issuing 'buy' recommendations on stocks while ordering their in-house brokers to sell the same stock. 
Baker's subcommittee also found instances of analysts unwilling to downgrade companies whose stock they themselves owned or whose investment banking business their own firms already handled or were actually seeking with the promise of rosy analyst reports. 
Several Wall Street securities organisations moved to bolster their analysts reporting procedures as a result of the hearings, and several institutions including Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Merrill Lynch & Co Inc subsequently ordered their analysts to disclose all their stock holdings. 
The new rules were due to be unveiled last year, but an announcement has been delayed because of the subcommittee's investigation into Enron Corp's collapse which Baker says makes the reforms even more necessary. 
Baker and Pitt will also be joined by NASD president and chief executive Robert Glauber at tomorrow's press event unveiling the new rules.

Enron's Baxter Died From Self-Inflicted Wound, Examiner Says
2002-02-06 14:52 (New York)

     Houston, Feb. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Corp. executive J. Clifford Baxter died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, according to autopsy results from the Harris County, Texas, Medical Examiner's office.
      The report, released today by Chief Medical Examiner Joyce Carter, confirms an earlier ruling that Baxter committed suicide on Jan. 25. Police in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land, Texas, found Baxter's body at 2:23 a.m. in his 2002 Mercedes-Benz, about a mile from his home. Attempts to revive Baxter, who was wearing a blue t-shirt and workout pants, were unsuccessful, the report says.
     A suicide note found at the scene has been sent to the Texas Attorney General's office for a ruling on whether it can be made public. The note said Baxter, 43, was distraught over Enron's collapse and the prospect of testifying against friends who worked there, CNBC reported the day of his death. Baxter resigned in May after a decade with Enron.
     The company is the subject of numerous shareholder lawsuits, as well as congressional and criminal investigations, after filing the largest bankruptcy in corporate history in December. Baxter was Enron's vice chairman before leaving the company in May.
     Sugar Land police are continuing to investigate Baxter's death. Justice of the Peace Jim Richard, who ordered the autopsy and hasn't seen the report, said he expects to concur with Carter's findings.
     ""Out of an abundance of caution, I ordered an autopsy,'' he said.

Tragedy
Ripple Effect ; In the wake of the Enron collapse ex-exec Cliff Baxter takes his life

In the past month or two friends had noticed his hair go from salt- and-pepper to almost completely white. Otherwise Cliff Baxter, a former vice chairman of the Enron Corp., seemed in reasonably good spirits. But the collapse of Enron amid allegations of wrongdoing was surely preying on Baxter, 43, who left the company abruptly last May. ""People are being investigated; people are being sued,"" Baxter's wife, Carol Whalen, 43, told a reporter for the Los Angeles Times recently. ""This is going to follow people for the rest of their lives, people who didn't do anything wrong."" 
A few days later the Enron scandal caught up with her husband-- and the consequences were tragic. In the early morning hours of Jan. 25, Baxter left his $700,000 home in the affluent Houston suburb of Sugar Land, got into his new Mercedes-Benz sedan and drove about a half mile. He pulled over between the medians and shot himself once in the head with a .38-cal. revolver. In the car was a suicide note, which reportedly expressed anguish over Enron's stunning tumble into bankruptcy. In recent weeks Baxter had been subpoenaed by Congress to testify about what he knew of the shady financial dealings that led to the company's fall and had also been named in a class-action suit filed by disgruntled shareholders who claim the top brass cashed in shares before the stock tanked.
The sad irony was that Baxter was one of the few executives who had raised objections within the company about accounting practices that allegedly wildly inflated the firm's profits, and he may have dreaded being forced to go public with his concerns. ""Cliff was looking pretty good in this,"" says one friend who had worked closely with Baxter and is now a consultant. ""But he was intensely loyal and would never like to be seen as a guy who's going to tell on everybody else."" 
Until the recent troubles, Baxter had led something of a charmed life. The youngest of six children, he was raised in the seaside community of Amityville, N.Y., where his father, Edwin, was a police sergeant and his mother, Dorothy, a municipal employee. He grew up as an avid surfer and boater. After graduating in 1980 from New York University, he enlisted in the Air Force for five years, where he served as a captain. He then attended Columbia University School of Business, graduating first in his class. In 1991 he moved to Houston to join Enron, a formerly staid natural-gas-and-pipeline firm that was then getting into the more aggressive area of trading commodities. 
His intelligence and brashness served Baxter well in Enron's go- go culture. He soon became chairman and CEO of Enron North America, the company's hugely profitable trading business. He was named chief strategy officer in June 2000 and vice chairman of the entire company four months after that. At its peak Enron was ranked as the seventh largest corporation in America. 
Baxter himself enjoyed an uncommonly favorable reputation among those who worked for him. John Allario, who was a manager at Enron North America, recalls the way Baxter handled the teams he coached in the company's annual basketball tournament. ""He reminded me of a very successful coach of a college or pro team--very demanding but very fair,"" says Allario. ""He made sure everybody got to play, but he had a burning desire to win."" And though Baxter worked long hours, he still carved out plenty of time for his family--wife Carol and their two children, John Clifford III (known as J.C.), 16, and Lauren, 11. ""He was very into his family,"" says one former employee. ""He really did go to Disney World every year."" Baxter's greatest delight, however, was going out on his 72-ft. cabin cruiser Tranquility. 
Meanwhile, over the past year or so, Baxter had started to raise storm flags over the way Enron did business. In her now-famous memo last August to Enron's former chairman Kenneth Lay, company executive Sherron Watkins pointed out that Baxter had already ""complained mightily"" to then-chief executive Jeffrey Skilling ""and all who would listen, about the inappropriateness of our transactions."" (In an interview with NBC's Today Show, Lay's wife, Linda, praised Baxter as a ""wonderful man"" whose death ""makes my heart ache. It makes Ken's heart ache."") When he suddenly stepped down from his post last May, Baxter cited a desire to spend more time with his family as the reason. It is still not clear why he did quit. What is certain is that he left a very wealthy man. From 1998 until early last year, Baxter had sold stock options worth $35.2 million. 
To be safe, police in Sugar Land are continuing to look into Baxter's death, though they say they have no reason to doubt it was a suicide. Congressional investigators in Washington, D.C., were hoping that Baxter would be able to supply some inside information of any possible malfeasance at Enron. Around the depleted corporate headquarters of Enron, which has taken plenty of hits lately, the news of Baxter's suicide left many people ""devastated,"" according to one staffer who worked with Watkins. ""It was like the last straw,"" she says. ""It just brings home the total misery of this situation.""

Business
Ignorant & Poor? ; His family says Ken Lay was misled about Enron and now is broke. Why Congress isn't likely to buy it

When Ken Lay shows up this week to testify before Congress, the disgraced former chairman of Enron should know how to handle a hostile crowd. Even his current employees, after all, are calling for his head. Just a few weeks ago, Enron employees tell TIME, the Houston-based energy-trading company brought in an outside consulting firm to conduct a series of focus groups with some of the remaining workers on how to reinvigorate the sagging firm. One of the first steps, six out of eight people indicated in one session, should be to get rid of Lay. 
Before the company officially went bankrupt, Lay, who had earned admiration for his unpolished, affable manner, had lost his loyal fan base. In late October--a day after Enron acknowledged that the SEC had opened an investigation of its accounting practices--Lay tried his best to raise the spirits of his downtrodden workforce. At a company gathering caught on videotape, the son of a Missouri minister promised that there wouldn't be any layoffs and that Enron would rise again. For once, though, the rank and file weren't drinking Ken's Kool-Aid. As one disgruntled worker put it, in a statement that Lay chose to read aloud: ""I would like to know if you are on crack. If so, that would explain a lot.""
Not enough, surely, to satisfy members of Congress. An army of legislators, lawyers and federal agents is bearing down on Lay with the threat of both civil and criminal charges. They all want to know why he seemed to be touting Enron stock and simultaneously selling his own shares--while knowing that the firm he had turned from a staid pipeline operator into an innovative energy-trading giant was imploding. Investigators for plaintiff lawyers tell TIME they are looking into allegations that investment bankers helped top executives like Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling (who is also supposed to pay a visit to Capitol Hill this week) put so-called collars on their stock options so they would not lose money, no matter how low the stock sank. 
Lay's dubious defense strategy was foreshadowed by his wife Linda in an ill-conceived appearance last week on NBC's Today show. She claimed that her husband was hoodwinked by nefarious underlings and that the proof of his innocence is that he and his family are now near bankruptcy. ""If those people had come back to him and told him there was anything wrong, he would have stopped it and fixed it,"" Linda Lay declared. ""There's nothing left. Everything we had mostly was in Enron stock."" 
When he appears before the Senate Commerce Committee, Lay is expected to argue, as his wife did, that he relied on the counsel of legal and financial experts, who told him there was nothing illicit or unethical about hiding billions of dollars of Enron's debts in off- balance sheet partnerships that ended up inflating the company's reported earnings. To prove his point--and show how much he believed in the company until the bitter end--the man who has collected some $200 million in compensation over the past three years will try to explain how he is now flat broke. An internal Enron probe released Saturday night blamed the company's demise on a wide range of executives and auditors but went easy on Lay. 
But the lawmakers and staff members preparing questions for Lay wonder how he is going to explain away all the evidence to the contrary. Lay's claim of ignorance is ""as implausible as imagining that Richard Nixon did not know what was being done by his staff at Watergate,"" says David Beim, a professor of economics and finance at Columbia University Business School. 
Lay knew all along about the possible ethical conflicts posed by the involvement of Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in off- the-books partnerships with shell corporations, according to a confidential study conducted at Lay's request by the Houston law firm Vinson & Elkins. On Nov. 5, 1997, as first reported by the Wall Street Journal, the executive committee of Enron's board voted to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in loan guarantees to a partnership known as Chewco. Then, in June and November of 1999, the board waived the company's ethics code to allow Fastow to serve as general partner of two additional partnerships, both supposedly independent of Enron. 
It's hard to imagine how the mounting evidence of trouble could have escaped Lay's attention by last summer. Vice chairman Clifford Baxter--who committed suicide late last month--resigned in May after voicing concerns about accounting practices to Lay's top deputy, Jeffrey Skilling. The whistle-blowing memo by Enron vice president Sherron Watkins was sent to Lay on Aug. 15. Another warning memo, from employee Margaret Ceconi, made its way to Lay soon after. Nonetheless, Lay in September was telling employees to buy more stock and bet on Enron's future. 
It was an open secret at Enron that the company was all but a ""house of cards that will fall,"" as a Texas energy executive attending an industry conference in Vail, Colo., a year ago groused to a senior Enron v.p. His dinner companion's startling reply: ""You're more right than you know."" Even people who believe that Lay was not involved in the dubious dealings of Skilling, Fastow and chief accounting officer Richard Causey concede that Lay had laid the foundation by encouraging Enron's ruthless, winner-take-all culture. A band of cocky, inexperienced young M.B.A.s was left alone to do whatever it took to structure a deal, regardless of the consequences. ""Pushing the limits was what you were told to do, and you were given the resources to do it,"" says an Enron manager. 
The Lays' claim that they are nearly as bankrupt as Enron is not winning them much trust or sympathy in Houston--or in Washington. Ken Lay now holds close to 3 million essentially worthless Enron shares, but he got most of his money by selling Enron stock early, reaping more than $100 million over the past three years. During that same period, he received salary and cash bonuses of more than $17 million. Last year alone he unloaded $25.7 million in Enron stock between January and mid-July as the share price fell from $80 to less than $50. And at the end of 2001, according to public records, he owned stock that today is worth more than $11 million in companies for which he was either an officer or director, including Compaq, Eli Lilly and a bevy of start-ups. 
The Lays own at least 20 properties in Colorado and Texas. These include their principal home--a five-bedroom high-rise condo in Houston that's worth at least $8 million--as well as rental properties from Houston to Galveston that are worth an additional $4.5 million. The Lays are selling all their Aspen, Colo., properties, including a 4,537-sq.-ft. log cabin and a four-bedroom riverfront house, together worth about $20 million. 
What's unclear is how much debt the Lays have. Lay and his lawyers declined to discuss that issue or answer other questions put to them by TIME. Last year Lay sold millions of dollars of Enron stock back to the company to repay some loans. It was not illegal, but it's a maneuver that makes it harder to track insider selling; instead of disposing of stock on the open market and having to declare it publicly soon afterward, Lay did not have to report it until 45 days after the end of the fiscal year. 
It was just that penchant for secrecy that got Enron in trouble in the first place. But as FBI agents and 10 congressional committees and subcommittees probe the scandal, it's only a matter of time before someone breaks the code. And when they do, Ken Lay may well have to deal with an even less sympathetic audience.

Business/Family Business
Lay's Sister Had A Sweet Deal Too

Ken Lay isn't the only member of his family to make a name in Houston's business elite. Travel Agency in the Park, co-owned by his younger sister Sharon Lay, 56, took the No. 4 spot in the Houston Business Journal's 2001 ranking of woman-owned businesses. But Ken Lay didn't just set an example for his sister--his company sent lots of deals her way. From 1996 through 2000, Sharon Lay's company (renamed Alliance Worldwide in December) received $6.8 million in commissions from Enron travel, according to SEC documents. Enron commissions reportedly accounted for half the travel company's revenue. 
While Enron's employees were in theory permitted to book their business travel elsewhere, Sharon Lay's was the agency of choice. Callers to Enron's corporate-travel department still reach a telephone extension at Alliance Worldwide. Enron managers strongly discouraged employees from going elsewhere, according to former Enron staff members. Says one: ""You only did that once."" A memo last June reminded Enron employees to use TAP because of its volume discounts. But in some cases, the agency quoted fares that were no better than published rates, and still charged Enron a $30-per-ticket fee, Enron insiders say. Sharon and Ken Lay declined to comment.
Other Houston travel firms knew they had little hope of an Enron contract. ""Let's just say it was hard to get in,"" says Gary Pearce, general manager of Navigant, one of the city's largest corporate- travel firms. For all of Ken Lay's belief in free-market competition, for family he made exceptions. Enron also acquired a company owned in part by Ken Lay's son Mark, who then received a three-year, $1 million employment contract. As for Ken Lay, he continues to travel on a private Enron jet.

As a member of Enron Corp.'s board of directors, Frank Savage seemed ideal for providing the kind of unvarnished advice and oversight that big companies need from their governing bodies. A director of Alliance Capital Management, a leading investment company, Savage also served on two other major corporate boards. 
That's what Enron told the world. What it didn't say was that Alliance is part of Axa Financial, a New York investment and insurance company, and that Axa was a huge Enron shareholder. So much for Savage's independence--and so, too, for the independence of the rest of Enron's board.
This week, as Congress holds another round of hearings on Enron's spectacular collapse, lawmakers will begin delving into why Enron's board failed to prevent financial calamity. It has been known that some directors have had extracurricular ties with the company. But the relationships are even tighter than has been revealed. As Enron was crumbling, its board effectively became one composed entirely of insiders, such that even the board committees that served crucial watchdog roles lacked anyone without some other relationship to the firm. 
Because outside directors are a public company's last line of defense, experts widely agree that these members should make up the majority of a company's board. But Enron's outside directors have had investment, consulting, and other business ties to the company, some of them not disclosed. They became involved in Enron's jumble of partnerships and subsidiaries. Several were part of ""interlocking directorates,"" in which they served together not only on the Enron board but on others as well. Some have been involved in organizations that have reaped millions in charity from Enron or its former chief, Kenneth Lay. Beyond those connections, directors had a strong incentive to back Lay's go-go strategy because they were required to take much of their compensation in stock. 
A few cases highlight the problem. Director Robert Belfer was the chief executive of Belco Oil & Gas Corp. For years his company has done tens of millions of dollars in business with Enron units, and it even acquired an Enron-affiliated company. Various Enron entities have invested in Belco. Belfer has joined many other directors in serving with other Enron ventures. 
Many of Enron's directors--including Robert Jaedicke and fellow audit committee members John Mendelsohn, Paulo Farraz-Pereira, Wendy Gramm, Ronnie Chan, and John Wakeham--are listed as directors of a murky Enron entity known as ES Power 3, among the thousands of subsidiaries and partnerships now under scrutiny. 
Sweet charity. Three Enron directors--Mendelsohn, Charles LeMaistre, and John H. Duncan--have been key figures in the University of Texas's M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, which has received at least $1.9 million from Enron or the Lay family or foundation. In Enron's early days, a firm in which Duncan was a partner received hundreds of thousands of dollars for investment services. Director Joe Foy has been a director of a Dallas utility company that competed with Enron to obtain power plant facilities. He was also a retired partner of a Houston law firm that has done work for Enron. 
Several directors have had well-paid consulting contracts with the company they oversaw. Perhaps the most lucrative of them went to John Urquhart, who has earned millions for such services, on top of millions more from stock deals with Enron and affiliated companies. An oil and gas services company affiliated with director Herbert S. Winokur Jr. has also reaped millions in sales from Enron. 
W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for the outside directors, could not be reached, and directors didn't return phone calls or declined comment. But the directors are expected to argue that the Enron executives and outside auditors withheld crucial information from them. Minutes of board meetings may suggest otherwise. But with Enron's vaporization of $67 billion in shareholder wealth, one thing seems sure: The subject of corporate governance, long the province of academics and activists, won't remain in the corner much longer. 
Bush's first Enron shot 
PENSION REFORM 
Employees would have more flexibility in managing their 401(k)'s--and President Bush deflects criticism that he's too tight with Enron. That's the upshot of a plan Bush announced last week that would allow employees to sell stock matched by their employers after just three years. Under the plan, Bush's first response to the Enron debacle, executives could not divest holdings when employees were barred from doing so. Businesses were pleased; Democrats said their plan is better.

Washington vs. Wall Street, again
The Editors

With 11 congressional committees pawing at the ground to investigate Enron and fears spreading that other corporations may have played hide-the-ball with their finances, the public must decide: Should Washington rein in corporate America? Or will government intervention only make matters worse and put the brakes on economic growth? 
Just about everyone agrees that executives at Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen should be put through the wringer and held accountable if they broke the law. But beyond that, there's a growing divide. On one side are the free marketers who say Enron is just one bad apple that duped its shareholders.
Congress should close a few accounting loopholes and call it a day--the markets will take care of the rest. On the other side are people who believe Enron is a sign that our regulatory system is broken--that big business is stampeding out of control and that we need new laws and agencies with sharp teeth to regulate the ""new economy."" 
Though the polling data are still raw, it's not encouraging for the free-market crowd. Three out of four Americans say big business has too much influence over Congress. Nearly as many feel the corporate practices that got Enron in trouble are widespread. Just 8 percent of Americans say they have a great deal of confidence in large corporations. 
Given those numbers, some political analysts say the stage is set for a tectonic shift in how the government and the public treat big business. A quick tour of 20th-century history shows Americans don't tolerate unregulated centers of power. Whether it's big business, big government, or big labor, when one force begins to dominate the landscape, the public tries to restore balance. When robber barons and massive financial trusts corrupted politics and manipulated markets in the early 1900s, the Progressive movement was born and Teddy Roosevelt went on a trustbusting spree. 
Curbing power. Labor's power surged in the 1930s and '40s, bringing long-denied basic rights to workers. But when the public decided labor's muscle was excessive--some 4.6 million workers went on strike in 1946--Congress began reining in unions with the Taft-Hartley Act. 
Government grew dramatically from Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal to Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. But a stagnant economy, Vietnam, and Watergate convinced Americans that Washington was bloated and corrupt. By 1981, Ronald Reagan could proclaim, ""Government is not the solution to our problem. Government is the problem."" A decade and a half later, Bill Clinton would declare, ""The era of big government is over."" 
The influence of these forces in society waxes and wanes. CNN political analyst Bill Schneider, who cowrote a book about public attitudes toward these institutions, told U.S. News that America could be on the verge of another ""progressive era,"" where perceived excesses of capitalism are curtailed. ""What captivates the public's imagination is the heedless behavior of the Enron executives,"" Schneider said. ""That's where you can draw real parallels between an Enron and the famous trusts of the early 19th century."" 
In predictable fashion, Congress is now considering a laundry list of reforms, from how we fund our pensions to how we finance our political campaigns. But for free-market advocates, those ""cures"" are far worse than the disease. Deregulation and corporate freedom, they say, are what fueled the great booms of the 1980s and 1990s. They insist that the market will correct itself with little new regulation, arguing that it's the financial damage to Enron and Andersen, along with the prospect of their executives doing jail time, that will discourage other companies from pulling the same tricks. 
Some critics have gone further, calling for an end to annual audit requirements altogether. Holman Jenkins of the Wall Street Journal points out that annual audits, required by the federal government for public companies, have failed to detect any of the nation's biggest financial scandals. In fact, rather than detect fraud, annual audits actually do damage by giving investors a false sense of security. Better to have the market hold CEOs responsible for convincing shareholders--by whatever means--that their books are clean. If the CEO can't do it, market forces will punish his company. 
So how should Congress respond to Enron? Is dealing with the specifics of the case enough? Or are we on the cusp of something much bigger? Does Congress need to rein in corporate power in America?

Fact and Comment; Steve Forbes on Enron fallout

ENRON 
In the aftermath, auditors of publicly held companies will become accountable only to the shareholders, not to a company's top management. That means the auditors will be hired and fired by the board of directors' audit committee. It will be the audit committee telling management who's going to be looking over the books rather than the other way around. The audit committee will determine fees, and it will approve the actual payment of those fees. Management won't be able to terminate the services of public accounting firms; only the audit committee will have that power. Management will be able to complain about the auditors, but that's all it'll be able to do. If there are major disputes between management and outside examiners, the audit committee will have to know about those conflicts.
Other than taking care of routine regulatory filings with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) and perhaps preparing company tax returns, outside auditors will be barred from providing services to publicly held companies whose books they are auditing. 
The SEC should be able to do most of the job of overseeing accountants and accounting rules. If legislation is needed to reinforce the notion that accountants are to work for the shareholders and the public, a now-cowed Congress will quickly comply. 
But let's not kid ourselves. Some managements will still be tempted to cook the books, though they'll have less cover and opportunity. Be that as it may, there are still going to be speculative booms. After all, numerous now-busted dot-coms never resorted to Enron-style sleights-of-hand to attract capital. They had no profits and often no sales, but investors still desired those dot-com shares. These speculative bubbles are similar to one definition of love--a willing suspension of disbelief.

Premonitions; Why the Enron story may be a case of history repeating itself.
Lynn J. Cook and Dan Ackman

Copyright 2002 Forbes Inc.

A spooky antecedent to the Enron scandal goes back 15 years. 
Armed guards at Enron's door. Fake trades and illicit gains. Criminal investigations. Pleas of ignorance from the top. Talk about history repeating itself--this was all back in October 1987, at Enron Oil's trading offices in Valhalla, N.Y. For two years a pair of rogue traders, Enron Oil President Louis Borget and his treasurer, Thomas Mastroeni, routinely violated the company's risk parameters and set up sham oil contracts with phony companies they created. They even pushed all deals through a single brokerage firm, and then collected kickbacks of up to five cents per barrel. Their reported take was almost $6 million. When the scam broke, Enron took an $85 million hit, wiping out the year's expected earnings. Chairman Kenneth Lay expressed shock at the shenanigans.
Kelly Dunn, a futures trader who was then a 24-year-old staffer in the Valhalla office, remembers it well. Looking back, it's hard to imagine Enron brass didn't know Borget was playing fast and loose with deals, she says, because she was told that at least one seasoned oil trader called Houston to warn of Enron Oil's true trading positions and losses. For instance, Enron Oil reportedly had open short positions (contracts to sell oil but no corresponding purchase contracts) in excess of 80 million barrels-more than six times the limit spelled out in Enron's risk-reduction policy and the rough equivalent to three months' output of the North Sea oilfields at the time. Dunn says the risk rules were routinely ignored in Valhalla: Every week position reports that detailed trading activities were written out in longhand and faxed to headquarters. ""Houston had to know our position was bigger than we were reporting, if we were making that kind of money,"" Dunn says. ""They turned a blind eye to big profits.""

A question of values

At the World Economic Forum last week in New York, talk centered not only on rogue nations like Iraq and North Korea. Delegates also worried about rogue companies like Enron and wondered if the U.S. government would be equally tough on them. 
Are there other huge enterprises out there that could collapse overnight? Many think so. Klaus Schwab, founder of the phenomenally successful World Economic Forum, told U.S. News that, based on his soundings of the business elite, there may be as many as 10 major corporations that could fall without warning.
No doubt, many of them could fail because of tough times. That's how capitalism is supposed to work--as economist Joseph Schumpeter said, it periodically unleashes ""gales of creative destruction."" We shouldn't worry much about those failures. But others could implode like Enron, companies that have lied to investors and then, when the bubble burst, allowed top executives to walk away with millions while leaving employees and investors holding the bag. 
Our problem is that we can't tell one company from the other because our system of safeguards has broken down. We no longer have reliable fraud protectors to spot the liars in advance. Enron, after all, didn't slip under the radar screen because it went off course once or twice. It hid debt in hundreds if not thousands of sketchy partnerships undisclosed to shareholders and dodged taxes by creating nearly 900 overseas subsidiaries--692 in the Cayman Islands alone. And, it turns out, Enron wasn't alone in hiding its losses behind accounting gimmicks. In the gilded '90s, a good many other companies did the same thing, and their books still aren't straight. 
Predators. That's why it is so disappointing that the Bush administration, admirably harsh in defending us against international wrongdoers, has been lackadaisical in guarding us against economic predators at home. Its response to Enron has been modest at best. To be sure, terror is more dangerous to life and limb. But companies like Enron are dangerous, too: They rob our financial system of public trust, which has always been an essential part of its magic. 
Who wants to invest in liars? 
Harvey Pitt, the president's choice to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, argues that the answer is to tighten up self-policing by industry. He has put forward a plan that is drawing nearly universal scorn. Others have put forward better ideas. Stanford's Maureen McNichols thinks companies should be forced to rotate their auditors every five years, thus avoiding cozy relations. Accountant Dave Cotton proposes that accounting firms work for the stock exchanges, not for private companies. 
These ideas, and others on the table, are worthy of exploration by Congress. But self-policing is ultimately not a complete answer. While most business people are honest--the accounting profession is full of top-flight professionals--some will always put private profits first. Like it or not, the government is the best instrument we have for protecting the public interest, and it is to government that we should turn now. Clearly the place to start is in stopping the sewage of campaign money in politics. 
True, there is no evidence that campaign contributions by Enron or Arthur Andersen bought specific favors from the Bush team. But the record is plain that by flooding Washington with cash, Enron was able to create a ""regulatory black hole"" so that regulators couldn't see what it was doing. It's also no coincidence that the accounting profession blocked a Clinton-era reform that would have prevented Andersen from performing a $25 million audit and simultaneously receiving $27 million in consulting fees from Enron. Most politicians aren't bought, but until we get campaign finance reform, they will remain on long-term lease. 
With Bush reluctant, Congress must now take the lead: Stiffen criminal penalties for company malfeasance. Restore the SEC as a corporate watchdog with teeth. Straighten up public reporting so that companies are transparent. And protect the pension funds of employees from company manipulation. 
Isn't it obvious, for example, that the SEC must be rebuilt? It was once a top-flight agency whose lawyers and accountants were fierce watchdogs against corporate chicanery. Recently, it has been in turmoil, losing a third of its employees in just three years. Its turnover rate among lawyers is twice that of other government agencies, a reflection, in part, of how our civil service has been allowed to deteriorate. 
Coming to the World Economic Forum, one saw, once again, that America is the envy of many other nations for reasons that extend far beyond our military might. By the standards of much of the world, we are an open and resilient people, remarkably free of corruption. To others, our values help explain why just 5 percent of the world's population produces some 28 percent of the world's wealth. Enron deeply offends our values, and we must act now to stop any encores.

Nation & World; On Politics
The Wives First Club
Gloria Borger

c Copyright 2002 U.S. News & World Report. All rights reserved.

We've seen this movie before: Politician/CEO gets into big trouble. His lawyers won't let him talk. His political/business advisers worry about his image. His press grows more and more abysmal. He's sinking fast. There is only one thing left to do: Send out the wife. After all, if she still stands by her man, how bad can he be? 
And so it was hardly a surprise when Linda Lay went public last week, defending her hubby, ""Kenny Boy"" (as both she and President Bush call him), the ex-CEO of Enron fame and misfortune. The sad and tearful spouse testified to her husband's decency and honor, both having been trampled by the ""mass hysteria"" of the press. ""He spent his entire life making absolutely certain that there was never, ever a point in his life that anyone could say he didn't have integrity,"" she assured NBC's Lisa Myers. "". . . Never, never not for one second would he have allowed anything to go on that was illegal.""
Thank goodness we got that all cleared up. 
What a handy idea, this Wives First Club: Send the sympathetic little woman out there as the first character witness to plead her spouse's case. So it was with Hillary Rodham Clinton, who made it clear that Gennifer Flowers was of no concern to her and therefore should be of no concern to us. It worked. And it worked again when Clinton blamed the ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" for her husband's problems. If she had not defended Bill Clinton, no one else would have. 
Just think of how much ground wives have gained over the years: Did Richard Nixon send Pat out to defend his character? Never. She emerged only to sit behind him during his ""Checkers"" speech as he struggled to save his vice presidency and once again to wave goodbye to the White House. And as White House counselor John Dean became engulfed in Watergate, where was his wife, Maureen? Sitting silently, too, watching him testify. And where was Lee Hart after her presidential candidate husband, Gary, was caught gallivanting with an attractive blond? Noticeably absent from his first--and most crucial--post-scandal press conference. 
Women's work. So we've come a long way, baby. Maybe it's cultural--feminism writ large. It's no longer unmanly to hide behind a woman's skirts; we've become a great PR move. (Tough luck for those unmarried pedophile priests.) After all, women are more sympathetic characters; at least that's what the pollsters say. We're also more believable. And since we're also legally protected from testifying against our spouses, we're perfect! So long as the culture of personal confession is with us, why not have a woman do the family confessing? In fact, if we don't publicly defend our spouses now, people wonder what's really wrong. To wit: Where was Mrs. Gary Condit last summer when Larry King was on the line? 
One caveat: The spousal defense is not foolproof. It's a good idea to make sure the wife has talking points that are (a) easy to believe and (b) easy to explain. That's where Linda Lay fell way short: In her TV chat, she said the family had ""nothing left. Everything we had mostly was in Enron stock."" Just what does ""mostly"" mean in this context? Could it mean the $8 million in stock in two outside companies and an additional $25 million in real-estate holdings? ""We're fighting for liquidity,"" she confessed. If you were a broke ex-Enron employee, would you be sobbing into a Kleenex upon hearing that news? And what about the explanation that CEO extraordinaire Ken Lay was out of his own loop? ""There's some things that weren't--that he wasn't told,"" his wife says. ""There's some things that the board of directors . . . didn't know."" A vast bureaucratic conspiracy, perhaps? 
Sure, Linda Lay just wants the rest of us to know her husband as she knows her husband. So do his kids, who were also understandably eager to talk about their dad's integrity. (The Lay family even made Ken's ex-wife available, who we learn still likes Ken so much that she even vacations with him and Linda and the rest of the clan.) Remember--even Condit's children went on TV to talk about their great dad. They felt that it was the least they could do. 
The family instinct to protect clan members is as old as civilization itself. But even Socrates, facing death over youth corruption charges, told his jury that he would make his own case. ""I have a family, yes . . . and yet I will not bring any of them hither in order to petition you for an acquittal."" And why not? ""One who has reached my years, and who has a name for wisdom, ought not to demean himself."" 
Besides, his wife wasn't good on TV, anyway.

Picture: No caption; Picture: Linda Lay stands by her man, Ken. In trouble? Send out the sympathetic wife.

FAIR COMPETITION Whatever Enron has done to investors, not to mention its employees' retirement plans, the ethically challenged energy-trading giant has been a boon to writers: Three have deals to probe the biggest corporate bankruptcy of all time. Joan O'Neil, a John Wiley & Sons publisher, signed last fall with journalist Loren Fox for Power Shock: The Rise and Fall of Enron. More recently Doubleday won the auction for Power Failure, paying, according to sources, $500,000 to Texas Monthly scribe Mimi Swartz, who had been interviewing Enron whistle-blower Sherron Watkins before her letter to the CEO became public. ""We can't give a definitive yes or no at the moment,"" says Doubleday spokesperson Suzanne Herz, when asked if Watkins will continue to cooperate with Swartz. And PublicAffairs will publish Pipe Dreams, by journalist Robert Bryce. ""He...has been following [the story] since well before anyone knew there was a story,"" insists PublicAffairs editor Lisa Kaufman. Ladies and gents, start your engines.

I'm at the hollowed halls of Harvard Bus. School trying to recuruit a
few more good men/women to become Enronites and will not make it back in
time for the game.

Seems like when I'm in town it rains and when I'm not it shines - maybe
someone is trying to tell me something.

Subject: Thursday's match


We play the dreaded team from Ponderosa on Thursday at home.  They have
won
only one point to our 2.5 so far this year. We will have three courts
but I
believe they only have 5 players so I am not sure how quickly we will
finish.  As a reminder, tomorrow night is the first night long sleeves
are
allowed in league play, so plan accordingly.  

Last week Allen and I were the only ones who showed up at Westador for
the
make up game.  While it had been officially cancelled Allen had
purchased
the shrimp that Ken has now required.  Because it could not be stored,
he
and I were forced to eat several pounds and wash it down with imported
beer.
Let this be a lesson for all, Thursday night is our night out, rain or
shine.  On a rather humorous note, you should have heard Allen's
explanation
to the Harris County deputy who wanted to know what two guys in shorts
were
doing in the front seat of a Black Lexus, in a pitch black parking lot.

Finally, in a further attempt to get all our members involved each week,
we
have asked Carl to act as our official ""coin man.""  Carl has studied at
the
prestigious ""Denver Institute of Coin & Stamp Valuation"" and is licensed
to
provide expert analysis of your coin and stamp collections.
Consequently,
in an effort to keep him off of the tennis courts, Ken has asked that if
you
have any old coins, bring them with you each week and Carl will pour
over
them and give you a professional estimate of their value by the end of
the
evening.  For those of you going on the cruise he has two evening
seminars
scheduled to discuss the benefits of owning coins issued from the Denver
mint between the years 1956-72.  I understand from Carl that the
presentation is spellbinding.

This is just another example of the benefits of being a member in good
standing of the Northgate 2, C level, tennis team.

One last note of interest, Ken has already assigned all the good lines
for
this match to his close buddies.  If you do not know what line you are
playing when you read this message, that should tell you about your
relationship with our new leader.

Your humble, but not bitter, ex-leader,

Please take a moment to review the instructions at the top of the file. They

reporting counterparties with their deals.  We want you to too. Please list
counterparties in the ""comments"" column. Counterparty information is held in
confidence and not shared with third parties.

Reported deals with counterparty information are treated as more reliable

I would like to meet with Tom, and then you and I can visit and further discuss the business plan goals, budget, future staffing if any and compensation guidelines for this position.

Enron Replaces Fastow as Finance Chief --- McMahon Takes Over Post; Move Follows Concerns Over Partnership Deals

Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major energy-trading companies. 
Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabilizing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, with annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billion, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's traded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operation, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in transactions.
""Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. ""There's not a trader out there that doesn't use EnronOnline."" As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid. 
Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar with the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transactions. 
While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement. 
Enron said Mr. Fastow ""will be on a leave of absence from the company."" He couldn't be reached for comment. 
It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at nearly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-active stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron stock. 
Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier this year, the stock was above $80 a share. 
In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies, which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, Dynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles. 
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could be seen as evidence that ""management does care"" about investor concerns. However, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming as it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as ""an admission of guilt."" Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron largely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financial structure. 
Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings. 
Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible ""death spiral"" in which increasing credit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any evidence of such a problem. 
However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities. Enron is facing a problem with ""trust and credibility. It's not easy to regain something as basic as trust,"" he said.

Enron Ousts Finance Chief As S.E.C. Looks at Dealings
By FLOYD NORRIS

c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, whose involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''
The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer. 
Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night. 
The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half since Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered when they later learned about it. 
On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr. Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions. 
The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand. 
By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected to address. 
Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either in cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assured investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate. 
Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in business strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75. 
According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time was the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving Mr. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMahon moved to a different job at the company, this person said. 
Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest price for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours trading, they fell to $16.14. 
One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell'' from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Monday. 
''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yesterday evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.'' 
But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People could fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never get any answers.''

Enron replaced Andrew Fastow as its chief financial officer, a day after chief executive Kenneth Lay stressed the company's confidence in Fastow, who performed dual roles as the energy giant's CFO while managing partnerships with which Enron did business. ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Lay said in a statement. The partnerships have been dissolved.

Enron replaces CFO to reassure investors 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
In a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on Wall Street, Houston-based Enron Corp. removed its chief financial officer Wednesday, as federal securities regulators review business dealings between Enron and two investment partnerships that he ran. 
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow had been put on a ""leave of absence"" for an undetermined period and named another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon, as his replacement. The company said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had done anything improper. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares. 
Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quarter earnings on Oct 16. 
The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enron's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment. 
The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron, served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments. 
But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time. 
So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also ended its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enron took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. 
Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a ""Chinese wall"" existed between Enron and LJM. 
Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer before moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up the company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortable with the Fastow-LJM setup. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available for comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving a salary. 
Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an ""informal inquiry"" into the LJM dealings. 
The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skilling in August for personal reasons. 
A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followed the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry. 
Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations. 
Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partnerships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities. 
Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business. 
In the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 16, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38. 
Wednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, which closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets. 
A conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with analysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped. 
On Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, moved from a ""hold"" to a ""sell"" rating.

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price. 
Enron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off. 
That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the partnerships established with Mr Fastow. 
Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earlier served as Enron's treasurer. 
Analysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough. Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demonstrating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called for Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those calls. 
Ms Coale issued a ""sell"" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. ""We are concerned about what we don't know,"" Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose customers to competitors that were not under such pressure. 
Enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove the company has done nothing wrong. Lex, Page 16.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - 'Sell' note issued on Enron shares.

Shares in Enron, the US energy group, fell again yesterday after Prudential Securities issued a ""sell"" note on concerns that the $1.2bn loss taken by the company last week might not be the end of its bad news. 
In the first hour of New York Stock Exchange trading, Enron's stock was the biggest percentage loser, dropping 20.2 per cent to $15.80 - its lowest level since August 1995. /
""We are concerned about what we don't know,"" said Carol Coale, the Prudential analyst who covers Enron. 
She was disappointed that Enron had not been more forthcoming in the conference call it held on Tuesday in response to charges it was not being transparent. 
Investors have been abandoning the stock since October 16, when Enron told analysts it was taking a $1.2bn loss in shutting down funding mechanisms it had set up in controversial partnerships established with Andrew Fastow, the chief financial officer. 
This charge has not been thoroughly explained, leading to confusion among analysts and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Ms Coale said she was concerned Enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. She said Enron might lose customers to competitors that are not under such pressure. 
Enron believes such concerns are misplaced and that the SEC enquiry will prove that the company has done nothing wrong.

Enron 
To lose a chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose the chief financial officer as well looks like carelessness.
Enron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in its third quarter release, was undermined by its decision to gloss over a $1.2bn equity charge related to the closing of ""related party transactions"" with two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention that the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest anyone? 
The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. Investors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so after its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposite effect. 
The charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes receivable, was the result of closing one of the vehicles - and the termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. The uncertainty is whether Enron might have to sell assets or issue new stock to cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles. Credit concerns and lack of disclosure explain the weakness of stock and bond prices. Enron is unlikely to lose its investment grade status, but dilution is a real risk for shareholders. Mr Fastow has gone (following Jeffrey Skilling, former chief executive, who quit after only six months as CEO). But the credibility problem goes beyond one individual.

Enron Corp. Cut to `Market Perform' at Banc of America
2001-10-25 08:49 (New York)

     Princeton, New Jersey, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg Data) -- Enron Corp. (ENE US)
was downgraded to ``market perform'' from ``strong buy'' by analyst William J
Maze at Banc of America.


Baring Asset Management's McClen on Enron: Investor Comments
2001-10-25 08:09 (New York)

     London, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by
Catherine McClen, who helps manage about $17 billion of bonds for
Baring Asset Management, about Enron Corp.

     Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader
$35 million. McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued
by Houston-based Enron during the summer.

     ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy
Fastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people
are about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent
conference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in
terms of calming investors' concerns.''

     ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has
got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,
and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is
realizing just how concerned investors are.''

     ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that
it could extend. You never know what could come of that.''

     ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with
the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset
write-downs.''

     ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of
disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third
quarter.''

     ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet
with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and
that was meant to begin in the third quarter.''

     ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write-
downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all
these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''

     ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of
questions.''

     ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of
a process where they're going to address and clean up their
balance sheet and they've started to replace management.''

     ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporate
bonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not another
nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''

     ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted
to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to
junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could
exist as a junk company.''

     ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``You
want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''
     ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have
to reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''

Enron ousts CFO amid partnership questions
By PAM EASTON
Associated Press Writer

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list investors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the company stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. 
""It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concern or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of the SEC,"" Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. ""Who knows?""
Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Monday's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did business with Enron while they were managed by Fastow. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed Wednesday. 
Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, who has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets group, takes over his role. 
""I think change is good at this particular point in time,"" said FAC Equities analyst Robert Christensen said. ""I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered."" 
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships. 
""I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements,"" Heim said. 
Replacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added. 
""There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community,"" Heim said. ""Instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever."" 
Enron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 per share, a 17 percent decline. 
Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week, Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent. 
""The market was asking for that to happen,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin said of Fastow's departure. ""This is really the first time Enron has acted as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis."" 
Previously, Enron's managers have been ""cautious and defensive in their approach,"" he said. 
During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have since been dissolved. 
The call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim. 
""I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever expect to take any more charges,"" Heim said. ""What I heard is we don't have to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed."" 
The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third quarter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive officer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's future, Heim said. 
""It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now, two years from now,"" he said. 
But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, Feygin said. 
Feygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused McMahon to leave his job as treasurer. 
""Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (the partnerships),"" Feygin said. ""Three days ago I would have said there is no need for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was something Enron needed to do.""

Enron fires CFO to quell unrest: Stock meltdown

Facing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chief financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble. 
After failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conference call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasurer Jeff McMahon.
The move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. The stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion of shareholder wealth. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said. 
Early last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, resulting from US$1.01-billion in write-offs. 
The company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow. 
In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently looking into the partnership arrangement. 
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors. 
During the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships. 
The stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time this week, to ""sell"" from ""hold."" Ms. Coale said the rating change is ""not because of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't know about the company."" 
Volume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average daily volume is 6.7 million shares. 
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron's line during the conference call. 
The company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chief financial officer led to a writedown of US$1.2-billion in shareholder equity. But Mr. Feygin said management was ""defensive"" when pressed for details. 
Ms. Coale reduced her price target down US$15 from US$55, assuming more bad news was to come. 
While the allegations of impropriety cloud Enron, Mr. Feygin said the company's credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short-term fortunes. 
Last week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. If Moody's lowered its rating, Enron's short-term debt costs would rise.

Enron replaces CFO Fastow in wake of LJM probe; appoints McMahon

HOUSTON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it named Jeff McMahon chief financial officer in place of Andrew Fastow. 
Announcing McMahon's appointment, Chairman Kenneth Lay said: ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO.""
Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two LJM partnerships run by Fastow, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. 
On Monday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transactions. 
McMahon had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group. 
The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter as saying McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships. 
Internal documents indicate Fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships, the newspaper reported.

Enron Corp. ousted Andrew Fastow as its chief financial officer Wednesday, a day after Chief Executive Kenneth Lay stressed the company's confidence in him despite growing controversy over Fastow's role overseeing partnerships that did business with the energy- trading giant. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" Lay said in a statement..
The company said Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also named his successor, Jeff McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer. 
The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half since Oct. 16, after Enron's third-quarter earnings release failed to disclose the partnerships.

Enron Ousts CFO Amid SEC Probe

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader $35 million. 
Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets group, as CFO because ""it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said.
Fastow will take a leave of absence. 
Shares of Enron, based in Houston, have plunged 80% this year. Third-quarter charges of $1.01 billion from failed investments outside the main commodities trading business wiped out 70% of the profit earned in the last four quarters. 
""Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to Andy,"" said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded Enron to ""long-term buy"" and owns no shares. 
Fastow, 39, ran LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, two partnerships created by Enron to buy company assets. Enron's involvement in the financing vehicles cost the company $35 million in third-quarter losses. 
Enron also bought back 62 million shares from LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billion to unwind its investment. 
During a conference call Tuesday, Lay said, ""I and Enron's board of directors continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy and think he's doing an outstanding job as CFO."" 
Enron announced that Fastow would leave after its stock closed down $3.38, or 17%, to $16.41 in trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, setting a new 52-week low. 
The SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships Monday. Spokeswoman Karen Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron is cooperating with, and that no subpoenas have been received. 
The company has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships and corporations, some of which buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants, records at the Texas secretary of state's office indicate.

Shell-Shocked Enron Parts With CFO

Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) problems won't go out the door with Andrew Fastow. 
The finance chief, who was replaced Wednesday, came under scrutiny as the executive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour, saddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this deal, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collapsed, falling 54% in just seven days. 
Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that scale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says Fastow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group. 
How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's alleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to show that the ""Fastow era"" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from LJM2. 
Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enron. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's account of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct. 
Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it took massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding backing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In other words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at the company? 
The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence. 
Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shadowy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading business makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board. 
In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed the LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from the downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders. 
Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency. 
Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonder people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management? 


Phew! Enron Stinks

Did Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) cause the energy crisis? Did it create a short squeeze in energy by buying up all available power and hoarding it, perhaps in a series of partnerships that it controlled? Did we wipe out billions in equity of utilities in some sort of bizarre zero-sum game in which Enron won it all and shareholders from California utilities lost? 
And was Enron at the hub of a vast power conspiracy to screw the U.S. consumer? 
Somehow, I believe that if it weren't for the events of Sept. 11 and its aftermath, these questions would be asked right now by a Justice Department antitrust division or a Congressional investigation. To me, this one smells worse than anything that Microsoft might have done at one time. 
And we need to give some of these departed Enron execs immunity to get to the bottom of what may have been the greatest antitrust act in history. 
We ought to do it fast, too, while there is some Enron left to pay the treble damages that violators owe. 
What surprises me is that some enterprising young prosecutor doesn't want to make his name blowing this one wide open. 
This nation must stop at nothing to get the terrorists. But it can't abandon the white-collar folks, either. 
There was just too much money lost too fast for what, in an era where energy seems pretty plentiful, couldn't possibly, in retrospect, be considered a real shortage.

For a while, in fact, they trailed larger-cap technology issues and blue chips, although there were moments when these stocks, too, slipped into negative territory. ?The day offered little anthrax news but lots of earnings reports, and investors voted according to whether their companies had done well or not. ?Generally for small caps, ""It's `where do we go from here' time,"" said Andrew Rich, small-cap portfolio manager with Driehaus Capital Management. A lot of small caps have recouped the ground they lost the first week the market reopened after the terrorist attacks, but there are few compelling reasons to be an aggressive buyer, Mr. Rich said. ""Now, it seems the whole market is looking for direction."" ?On the Nasdaq, volume was 1.865 billion shares, with 1.321 billion advancing and 516 million declining. Gainers outpaced decliners by 1,902 to 1,628. ?It was tech all the way among the day's top performers. ?Communications technology, including a lot of fiber-optic and networking firms, ranked highest. Among small caps, Adtran rose 97 cents, or 4.2%, to 23.97, Arris Group jumped 75 cents, or 19%, to 4.60 and Extreme Networks added 93 cents, or 7.6%, to 13.17. ?Semiconductors were the session's second-best presenters with, among small caps, Elantec Semiconductor adding 3.71, or 12%, to 34.15, and Oak Technology rising 86 cents, or 11%, to 8.80. ?Wireless-communications stocks were also strong, with help from large-cap Nextel Communications, which advanced 1.29, or 17%, to 8.69 after posting a third-quarter loss that surpassed Wall Street estimates amid continued firmness in subscriber growth. In some possible spillover among small caps, AirGate PCS rose 3.28, or 6.1%, to 56.78. ?The day's poorest performers were natural-gas utilities, which continued to be dragged down by large cap Enron, which fell 3.38, or 17%, to 16.41. Piedmont Natural Gas fell 34 cents, or 1.1%, to 30.63, and Peoples Energy shed 56 cents, or 1.4%, to 39.06. ?Pegasystems jumped 1.21, or 43%, to 4.01 after a 12% rise Tuesday. The Cambridge, Mass., developer of customer-management software enjoyed an even stronger second day yesterday, following Tuesday's release of better-than-expected third-quarter earnings of 12 cents a share, beating an analyst's estimate by 10 cents a share. ?Pinnacle Systems rose 83 cents, or 25%, to 4.20. The Mountain View, Calif., video-production-system maker had a fiscal first-quarter loss of 11 cents a share before items, beating Wall Street expectations by eight cents a share. Thomas Weisel upgraded shares to `buy' from `market perform.' ?Sybase jumped 1.99, or 17%, to 13.50. The Emeryville, Calif., online-software developer reported 20 cents a share in earnings before items, beating Wall Street's expectations by two cents a share. ?In a follow-on offering, AmeriPath gained 2.24, or 8.4%, to 29.04 after offering 4.125 million shares at $26 each. The follow-on, as is the custom, was priced at a discount to Tuesday's close of 26.80. ?Merger activity had a positive effect on small caps. PRI Automation jumped 3.38, or 27%, to 15.92. The Billerica, Mass., semiconductor-equipment maker signed a definitive agreement to be bought by Brooks Automation for about $380 million in stock. Under the accord, which was approved by both companies' boards, PRI shareholders will receive 0.52 Brooks share for each PRI share held. Brooks Automation fell 1.31, 3.9%, to 31.80. ?Vysis surged 7.26, or 31%, to 30.26. The Downers Grove, Ill., genetic-disease researcher agreed to be acquired by Abbott Laboratories for $30.50 a share, or $355 million. Abbott rose 38 cents to 54.24. ?ONI Systems dropped 1.01, or 15%, to 5.62. The San Jose, Calif., maker of fiber-optic communication equipment met analysts' third-quarter consensus estimate of 19 cents a share, excluding items, but said its fourth-quarter loss will range between 16 cents and 20 cents a share, on revenue of $40 million to $50 million, when analysts were expecting a loss of 16 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $50.1 million.

All Rights Reserved.??WASHINGTON - Directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group The Corporate Library, the group's co-founder said yesterday. ?In a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country, long-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded grades of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks.?""It's always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve,"" said Ms. Minow, who said the service will be called Board Analyst. ?Planned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year, she said. ?Only directors of U.S. companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added later. ?Ms. Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes. ?Their latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons. ?""There's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors,"" said Ann Yerger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents America's large pension funds. ?The corporate governance movement, since its beginnings in the 1970s, has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples of lax board oversight still abound. ?One example would be Enron Corp., whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Ms. Minow said. ?""Where was the Enron board in all of this?"" she asked. ""Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That apparently didn't happen here."" ?Taking the corporate governance argument a step further, Ms. Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company. ?""This isn't just a corporate governance thing. This is part of investment analysis,"" she said. ?Institutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open question. ?""Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction,"" said Peter Gleason, vice-president of research and development at the National Association of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate directors. ?Surveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns.

The move follows Tuesday's conference call, which was an attempt by Enron to restore investor confidence in the company.?""Andy Fastow was a very well-regarded, low profile individual at Enron, and he's been unfairly pilloried in the press,"" said John Olson, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston. ""But the weight of circumstantial evidence and the material stock price decline made this inevitable.""?Olson predicted the CFO swap would improve Enron's credibility with Wall Street.?A rough week?Enron has been under fire since last week as questions have surfaced about its accounting practices, especially in regard to two limited partnerships created by Fastow in 1999 and since dissolved. ?Enron said Fastow had taken a leave of absence and that McMahon, most recently chairman and CEO of the industrial markets group and treasurer from 1998 to 2000, would take over.?""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" said Lay, in a statement.?Karen Denne, a spokesperson for Enron, said numerous discussions Tuesday and Wednesday led to the decision. She said she did not know when Fastow would return. ?Shares of Enron fell more than 17 percent Wednesday to $16.41, then fell further in late trading following the announcement, to as low as $16.18.

""This company has been very much abused and maligned by people on Wall Street. They have some excellent businesses, and they have been carrying some losers."" Enron has ""an excellent growth profile and tremendous profitability in their growth businesses, and excellent surplus cash flow,"" Olson said.?Enron expects to generate $3 billion of cash flow this year, and with $500 million devoted to dividends and $1 billion to maintenance capital spending, the company will have $1.5 billion free.?Several Wall Street firms cut their ratings on Enron shares Wednesday, including Prudential Securities.

The paper this week said Skilling saw no problem with it, which led McMahon, 40, to ask for a job change. ?Fastow has denied any wrongdoing, but has been limited in his ability to speak about the issues because of the SEC investigation and shareholder lawsuits now pending against the company. ?As recently as a year ago, Enron had a stellar image as a corporate innovator with a Midas touch. Its profits and stock price soared as it transformed from a natural gas pipeline company to a high-tech money machine creating new Internet-based trading markets in a wide range of commodities. ?But some of its new businesses faded, a large investment in an Indian power plant went sour, the California power crises spooked investors, and then Skilling stunned the financial community with his sudden resignation. ?There also was grousing from investors that Enron's earnings statements had become convoluted to the point of incomprehensibility. ?Analysts said the replacement of Fastow was a step in the right direction for Enron, but not a panacea for its credibility problems. ?""The problems investors are having with Enron are related to a lack of understanding of all these partnership arrangements. Changing the CFO by itself doesn't really address those concerns,"" said Mike Heim at A.G. Edwards. ?""I don't think anyone has a full understanding of the extent of the liabilities Enron might have with these partnerships,"" he said. ""I still have a lot of questions."" ?Andre Meade at Commerzbank Securities said Fastow's departure was not unexpected, but not that helpful. ?""Investors are not going to see this as a huge move that clears up the picture,"" he said. ""Frankly, Ken Lay and the board don't have clean hands when it comes to these transactions."" ?""The fear driving the market is: if this is what we know, how much worse can it get?"" said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin.??Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 	??USA: Utility stocks drop on slipping expectations.?By Jim Brumm??10/24/2001?Reuters English News Service?(C) Reuters Limited 2001.??NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Slipping expectations of 2002 power profits combined with Enron Corp.'s growing problems helped drag utility stock prices to their lowest levels this month on Wednesday. ?While the general market closed higher, the S&P Utilities Index ended the day with a loss of 8.99, or 3.55 percent, to 244.32.?The big loser, as it has been in many recent sessions, was Enron, which traded at the lowest price since February 1995 before steadying a bit to close at $16.41 - down 17.08 percent, or $3.38, for the day and 44 percent from its price two weeks ago - as analysts recommended selling the stock. ?Prudential's Carol Coale said the sell recommendation was not made ""because of things that we know, but because of things we potentially do not know. ?After the close Enron said it named former treasurer Jeff McMahon to replace Andrew Fastow as chief financial officer, and quoted chief executive officer Kenneth Lay as saying ""it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO."" ?Close behind Enron on the biggest loser lists Wednesday were companies that had patterned themselves after the power trading giant. Closest was Dynegy Inc. which closed with a loss of $5.45, or 12.76 percent, at $37.26 - its lowest price in three weeks. ?POWER EARNINGS FORECASTS TRIMMED ?The talk of lower estimates of 2002 earnings from power production and trading came from four companies active in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest - American Electric Power Co. Inc. , Exelon Corp. , Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. and PPL Corp. . ?Early Wednesday, PPL said it now sees little, if any, change in earnings per share next year from this year, citing expectations of lower profits on power sales in Maine, Pennsylvania and Montana. The company also confirmed it still sees 2001 earnings exceeding $4.00 per share. ?Noting PPL's previous 2002 guidance was $4.55 to $4.65 per share, Wachovia Securities analyst Thomas Hamlin lowered the stock's rating to ""market perform"" from ""strong buy"" explaining PPL's ""failure to differentiate itself from the power producing price takers has hurt management's credibility. ?""The company will need to prove its risk management capabilities in order to be afforded a multiple in line with our higher rated Merchant Power stocks,"" he concluded. ?Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Lehman Brothers made similar downgrades in Exelon after its first 2002 guidance trailed analyst expectations. ?STOCK LOSSES FOLLOW OUTLOOK CHANGES ?""The primary driver (for the 2002 estimate) is lower wholesale commodity price assumptions at (the company's generation unit), in addition to weaker distribution demand"" at Exelon's utility subsidiaries in Philadelphia and Chicago, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst James Dobson wrote Tuesday. ?Exelon officials noted, in answer to analyst questions, that the view of 2002 demand had changed to negative from flat since the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. ?The company's stock, which opened 10 percent lower - at $40 - following the earnings release early Tuesday steadied to close at $41.80. The shares continued to advance Wednesday when its 12-cent rise made it one of four gainers among the 40 S&P Utility Index components. ?The big loser among the integrated utilities - those which produce and distribute power - was PPL, which ended the day at $32 - down $1.68, or 4.99 percent. ?Losses of about 1.3 percent were posted by AEP, which closed at $42.59, down 55 cents for the day, and PSEG, which slipped 52 cents to $39.48. ?AEP ""management cautioned that the slowing economy may make the upper end (of its 2002 earnings guidance of $3.80 to $3.90) more difficult to achieve,"" Lehman Brothers analyst Daniel Ford wrote in a note that maintained his estimate. ?He lowered his estimate of PSEG 2002 earnings per share 5 cents to $4.05 while awaiting the closing of a Peruvian purchase and pointed out it receives more for electricity than most PJM power producers because of restraints on the delivery of Midwest electricity to New Jersey's power hungry markets.??Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The complaint alleges that defendants misled investors (1) by reporting assets that were overvalued by more than $1 billion, which caused writedowns in that amount and are expected to lead to further writeoffs of hundreds of millions of dollars, (2) by concealing facts regarding relationships with a related entity that led to a more than $1 billion reduction of shareholders' equity and a $35 million charge, and (3) by obfuscating or failing to disclose the fact that agreements with other related entities satisfaction of which include obligations that may require the Company to issue large amounts of its shares. This misconduct caused the market prices of Enron stock to be artificially inflated during the Class Period. When facts about these matters were disclosed at the end of the Class Period, the market price of the Company's per share stock fell from a high of $90 per share during the Class Period to a low of $15 per share, and securities analysts downgraded their ratings of the Company's stock despite the precurietous fall in its market price.

Houston, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. executives?profited from inside knowledge when they sold $73 million in?shares ahead of a 26 percent drop in the energy trading company's?stock in February and March, a shareholder alleges in a lawsuit.??     The allegations of insider trading were filed today as an?amendment to an earlier lawsuit filed by shareholder Fred?Greenberg.??     The original lawsuit, filed on Oct. 17 in Houston, accuses?Enron's board of costing the company at least $35 million through?dealings with two partnerships run by former Chief Financial?officer Andrew Fastow.??     In the amendment filed today, the suit accuses Fastow of?using insider knowledge that Enron's stock was going to drop to?prevent losses at one of the partnerships, LJM2.??     The partnership was committed to buying Enron stock at?predetermined price in September 2000, the complaint says. Enron?agreed to renegotiate the terms of the transaction to let LJM2 buy?the shares two months early.??    That let the partnership earn a $10.5 million in profit, the?suit says. If the transaction had not been renegotiated, the?partnership would have lost $8 for every share it sold in?September, the suit alleges.??                           `Bailed Out'??     ``Mr. Fastow and LJM2 took advantage of inside information to?reap illicit insider trading profits, in the millions of dollars?in this transaction alone,'' the suit says.??     At the same time that the LJM2 transaction was being?renegotiated in December and January, Chief Executive Officer?Kenneth Lay, President Mark Frevert and other top managers sold?the $73 million in shares, the suit alleges.??     Enron executives ``bailed out of shares... reaping huge?insider trading profits,'' the lawsuit says.??     Other sellers included former CEO Jeff Skilling, Chief?Strategy Officer Cliff Baxter, broadband services CEO Ken Rice,?Chief of Staff Steve Kean, pipeline group CEO Stanley Horton and?Chief Risk Officer Richard Buy, the suit says.??     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the?lawsuit.??     ``We haven't been served (notice of the suit), and it's our?policy not to talk about pending litigation,'' she said??     In March, spokesman Mark Palmer said the executives exercised?stock options that would have expired worthless otherwise.??     Enron has formed at least 18 affiliated companies to buy and?sell company assets, according to records from the Texas secretary?of state. The Houston-based company reported $1.01 billion in?third-quarter losses, including $35 million from the LJM?partnerships run by Fastow.??                            SEC Inquiry??

(Adds description of Enron Net Works in sixth paragraph.)??     Houston, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. ousted Chief?Financial Officer Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange?Commission inquiry into partnerships he ran that cost the largest?energy trader $35 million.??     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets?group, as CFO because ``it became clear to me that restoring?investor confidence would require us to replace Andy,'' Chairman?and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.?Fastow will take a leave of absence.??     Shares of Enron, based in Houston, have fallen 80 percent?this year. Third-quarter losses of $1.01 billion from failed?investments outside the main commodities trading business wiped?out 70 percent of the profit earned in the past four quarters.??     ``Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to?Andy,'' said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded?Enron to ``long-term buy'' today and owns no shares.??     As Enron treasurer, McMahon complained to then-Enron?President Jeffrey Skilling about potential conflicts of interest?posed by the Fastow partnerships in 1999, the Wall Street Journal?reported yesterday. Rebuffed, McMahon secured a reassignment, the?Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.??     ``McMahon was made famous under Skilling by going to him and?objecting to the partnerships,'' Feygin said. ``For that, he was?transferred out of the treasurer function into Enron Net Works,''?which oversees Enron's Internet trading system.??                       `An Outstanding Job'??     Fastow, 39 years old, ran LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,?two partnerships created by Enron to buy company assets. Enron's?involvement in the financing vehicles cost the company $35 million?in third-quarter losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares?from LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billion to unwind its investment.??     On a conference call yesterday, Lay said that ``I and Enron's?board of directors continue to have the highest faith and?confidence in Andy and think he's doing an outstanding job as?CFO.''??      Enron announced that Fastow would leave after its stock?closed down $3.38, or 17 percent, to $16.41 in today's trading.??      The SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships Monday.?Spokeswoman Karen Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron?is cooperating with, and that no subpoenas have been received.??     The company has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships?and corporations, some of which buy and sell Enron assets such as?power plants, records at the Texas secretary of state's office?indicate.??     The Texas records list dozens of Enron executives as officers?and directors of company-related partnerships. None of them have?any financial interest in the partnerships after Fastow severed?ties to the LJM partnerships in July, Palmer said.??                        `Zero Compensation'??     ``The managers in these affiliates listed as managing members?are representational in nature only,'' he said. ``They get zero?compensation.''??     The LJM partnerships were different. Enron's board allowed?Fastow, who has worked for the company for 11 years, to run them?and earn as much as 2 percent annually on the amounts invested,?the Wall Street Journal reported last week. A lawsuit filed by a?shareholder objecting to the arrangement said the partnerships?reworked an agreement with Enron to avoid taking big losses.??     Enron is obligated to repay $3.3 billion associated with two?other partnerships, Marlin and Whitewing, if they can't raise?enough money from asset sales to pay off the balance, Enron?spokesman Mark Palmer said. Palmer said ``maybe, maybe not'' when?asked if the partnerships will generate enough cash.??     ``The concern now isn't just with the LJM partnership, it's?more with the other partnerships, such as Osprey and Marlin,''?said A.G. Edwards analyst Mike Heim, who has a ``hold'' rating on?Enron and owns no shares.??                       High Level Departures??     Enron has lost several senior executives in the past two?years. CEO Skilling resigned in August after seven months on the?job, citing personal reasons and frustration with declines in the?company's stock price. Enron Corp. Vice Chairman Joseph W. Sutton?left the company in November as the company switched its focus?from developing assets to energy and commodity trading.??     Rebecca Mark, one of the highest-ranking women in U.S.?business, quit August 2000 as chairman and chief executive of?Azurix Corp., a water company formed by Enron Corp. Mark also?resigned from Enron's board.??     Azurix was a money-losing investment. Enron sold shares in?the water company to the public that it later had to buy back.??--Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom at 609-750-4651??

	Jim Schwieger/ENRON@enronXgate 06/07/2001 04:16 PM 	   To: Brian Redmond/ENRON@enronXgate, Barbara N Gray/HOU/ECT@ECT  cc: John J Lavorato/ENRON@enronXgate, Thomas A Martin/ENRON@enronXgate  Subject: Bammel Lease Question	


I was wondering if the Bammel lease to AEP contains any operating parameters to protect the integrity of the facility.  The question arises from the fact that Bammel  had about 24 BCF of remaining capacity when Enron turned the facility over to AEP.  We believe their plan is to max inject in June which would reduce the remaining capacity to around 12 BCF.  It could become a challenge to keep injections under the remaining 12 BCF level during the reaming 4-5 months of the injection cycle.  Enron always operated the facility with the understanding that a Gas In Place volume greater than 117.5 BCF could create a high enough pressure to jeopardize the safety of the wellhead casings and some of the abandoned wells.  We would not want the Texas RRC to question the safety of the Bammel facility.  From the other end of the perspective if the Gas In Place is taken below 65 BCF their is a high probability of watering out the outer wells and the facility itself.

more comfortable.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

It is my understanding from a discussion we had with Tom and David that the EEX contract, which is a fixed price deal with ENA, is not going to HPL. and should not be listed on Schedule 4.13 (v).  Instead, ENA will sell to HPL the EEX gas at index.  There needs to be a contract put into place that reflects the sale from ENA to HPL and that contract will be listed on Schedule 4.13 (v).  We have agreed to provide AEP with the amended and updated schedules on Monday the 15th, so we should go ahead and get this documented now.   Barbara--who typically puts together gas purchase agreements like this?   Please call if you have any questions.

Sandi,

Attached is an excel spreadsheet which serves to update Schedule 4.13 (v) to the AEP Agreement covering Material Contracts.  The list reflects information in Enron's Global Contract System as of April 30, 2001 and covers business which will be conducted after June 1, 2001.  We direct your attention to Column AB of the spreadsheet:  those contracts which were included on the April 2000 6th Revision of Schedule 4.13 (v) are noted by their numerical designation in that Schedule; those contracts which cover deals traded subsequent to 3/15/2001 (the cutoff for the earlier Schedule) are so noted; and, those deals which were considered during our prior reviews but excluded from the final April 2000 6th Revision of the Schedule for various reasons are so noted with an explanation in the Comments Column, AC.

The April 2000 6th Revision cites 3 purchase contracts with Forrest Oil Corporation; while we included 96007597 and 96048499 on the spreadsheet attached, we could find no justification for also including 96049286 on the list.  You may have other information which supports including 96049286 on the schedule

The attached excel spreadsheet includes the EEX E&P Company, L.P. fixed price contract, 96054930, done by the Enron Finance Group for 4/2001 thru 12/2004.

Sandi,

Attached is an excel spreadsheet which serves to update Schedule 4.13 (v) to the AEP Agreement covering Material Contracts.  The list reflects information in Enron's Global Contract System as of March 15, 2001 and covers business which will be conducted after May 1, 2001.  We direct your attention to Column AB of the spreadsheet:  those contracts which were included on the original Schedule 4.13 (v) are noted by their numerical designation in that Schedule; those contracts which cover deals traded subsequent to 12/12/2000 (the cutoff for the earlier Schedule) are so noted; and, those deals which were considered during our prior review but excluded from the final Schedule for various reasons are blank.

As we have discussed, I will be providing you with information relating to those contracts which were set forth on the original 12/15/2000 Schedule but failed to meet the criteria for the 3/15/2001 Schedule by Friday.

George and Sandi,
	In response to George's Schedules to PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT, we need to make two changes to the existing list.  The first being Entex Gas Resources Corp. global number 96053954.  This was entered in Global as a GTC which was entered as a bogus contract and number.  Dan Hyvl will prepare a Transaction Agreement covering the period of April 1, 2001 through October 31, 2001, Sitara Deal #528936.  This Transaction is part of an existing contract already in place between ENA and Entex Gas Resources Corp, therefore we did not add to our Supplemental Schedule to Stock Purchase Agreement.
	The second change being Exxon Mobil Corporation, global number 96021964.  This deal was done as a Sales under a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement between HPL and Mobil Oil Corporation, effective 12/1/2000 which was not captured in Global.  This agreement is now in Global with the number being 96055715.  
	Everything else has been captured and on our schedules.  If you have any questions, please call.

Thanks, Kim

Kim,
Please look at this and obtain copies of all referenced agreements. They should all be brand new (could be transactions under existing masters). Once we've done that, we need to list as we did the other material contracts for the Triple Lutz schedules. Call with questions

thanks,
Sandi

Sandi, the attachment list the 16 contracts which need to be added to the Material Contracts Schedule as a result of our review of all deals entered from 11/15/2000 to 12/27/2000.  In addition, the correct Spinnaker (Ranger) contract is now 96047295, not the GTC formerly cited, 96046001.

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Irma,

I respect the fact that a mistake was made, my problem is that the mistake causes me to have to wait until November 20th to get it fixed.  It seems that you could have called me if you had a question about the form since it was turned in at least six weeks ago.  So what are my options other than waiting until November 20th?

Tom

Mr. Martin,

I wanted to take a moment this morning to provide you an update on your recent ESOP change request.  I have received confirmation from Corporate Benefits that your form has been received.  Unfortunately due to current switch over of our Savings vendor, which was also the vendor for our ESOP program, we are still experimenting the blackout period on any savings plan activity through November 20th.  

Also, I wanted to point out my error with the processing of your form.  Since this was a very old stock program form, I accidentally confused it for an enrollment form to our direct service program, which is the program that allows employees to purchase stock through payroll deduction twice a month.  In a nutshell, I accidentally forwarded your form to the incorrect resource and then had to re-route it to the correct group which is our corporate contact for the 401(K) savings plan.  

I apologize for the delay in providing you with this update and am extremely sorry for my mistake.   Please let me know if there is anything that I can do asides from following up with Corporate benefits after the blackout period to check on the status of your request and then I will provide your asst, Laura with an update. 

Thanks.

Hi, Ben.  When you receive the information regarding Tom Martin's ESOP changes, and whether or not the appropriate people have received the information, would you please send me some kind of notification?  Please also let me know if Tom is the person who needs to call and inquire about it, as you suggested may be the case since it is handled outside of Enron.

Thanks for your help,
Laura Vuittonet

FYI the attached.  
 
Lets put this together for the Texas Region and then we can integrate it with the rest of the regions.  I will work with Barry, Laura, Frank, and Fred to come up with a common format and methodology that will tie the various regional plans together.  I will call on Friday to discuss - please let me know where you will be - in the office or at home.

Subject: Re-start/Integration Planning



We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster 
+       HR                      David Oxley 
+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side   
+       Customers               Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) 
                                Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) 
                                Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) 
+       Action Plan             Phase  1 Customers 
                                Phase  2 Customers 
                                Phase  3 Customers 
+       Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) 
+       Customer visit schedule 

Product Side 
+       List of Products        Phase 1 - First Week 
                                Phase 2 - First Month 
                                Phase 3 - First Quarter 

Target Number of Transactions 
+       Phase 1 
+       Phase 2 
+       Phase 3 

IT transfer

Blockbuster Deal Sowed Seeds Of Enron Fiasco
2002-01-17 23:05 (New York)

  By Rebecca Smith 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  When Enron Corp. and Blockbuster Inc. joined forces in mid-2000, it looked
like they were onto something big. The companies announced they would soon be
allowing consumers across America to choose from among thousands of movies,
including hot new features, sent via telephone lines to watch on their TVs at
home. 
  Announcing the partnership in July 2000, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay called it
the ""killer app for the entertainment industry."" Blockbuster Chairman John
Antioco said the two companies had come up with the ""ultimate
bricks-clicks-and-flicks strategy."" Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison later
committed his private company, nCube Corp., to provide critical computer
hardware and $2 million. Mr. Ellison said he was ""proud"" to be part of the
venture. 
  It looked like another brilliant move by Enron, already a hero on Wall
Street. The Houston company had aligned itself with the nation's leading video
retailer. The 20-year deal would bring traffic to Enron's fledgling fiber-optic
telecommunications network. And the venture reaffirmed the notion that Enron,
already America's pre-eminent energy trader, would soon be a lucrative
middleman for a vast range of other products, as well. 
  But within eight months of its launch, the partners had split. Enron blamed
Blockbuster for not getting the biggest movie studios to sign licensing deals
that would have guaranteed the hottest titles. Blockbuster said the criticism
was unfair. The video-rental company had expected to build the business
cooperatively over two decades. Enron's impatience ""didn't add up,"" says
Blockbuster spokeswoman Karen Raskopf. 
  As it turns out, Blockbuster didn't know the half of it. Within months of
inking the deal, Enron had set up an affiliated partnership, code-named Project
Braveheart, an apparent allusion to the 1995 Mel Gibson movie. Enron obtained a
$115.2 million investment in the partnership from CIBC World Markets, the
investment-banking arm of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Toronto. In
return, CIBC received a promise of almost all earnings from Enron's share of
the venture for the first 10 years. Blockbuster didn't know about Braveheart at
the time, Ms. Raskopf says. 
  The partnership had no separate staff and no assets other than Enron's stake
in the venture with Blockbuster, which was barely getting off the ground in
late 2000. Still, in an audacious accounting move, Enron claimed $110.9 million
in profits from Braveheart in the fourth quarter of 2000 and the first quarter
of 2001. That amount sharply limited the overall losses suffered by Enron's
young fiber-optics division in the two periods. 
  At its peak, in March 2001, the venture with Blockbuster provided only about
1,000 test customers with movies in four U.S. cities. Many of those customers
didn't even pay. ""It was nothing but a pilot project,"" says Blockbuster's Ms.
Raskopf. ""I don't know how anyone could have been booking revenues.""
Blockbuster, a unit of Viacom Inc., never accounted for any financial gain or
loss from the short-lived venture, she says. 
  Project Braveheart was one of dozens of outside partnerships that Enron
officials created to burnish the company's financial results at a time when it
felt under pressure to show high profits that would justify its soaring stock
price, according to current and former company executives. One of the reasons
Enron began sliding toward bankruptcy court last fall was the abandonment of
some of these accounting maneuvers, which contributed to huge losses and the
collapse of its stock. 
  Some of the partnerships were designed to shift large debts off Enron's
balance sheet and make the company appear more robust in the eyes of investors
and credit-rating agencies. Others, such as Braveheart, raised fast cash needed
to fund Enron's ever-expanding array of new businesses. The company had a grand
vision -- to move away from its roots in the energy business and build
futuristic electronic markets in everything from newsprint to bandwidth. But
the vision wasn't panning out financially, according to the current and former
executives and internal company documents. 
  Enron's current chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, says he had nothing
to do with Braveheart or related partnerships. ""I'm not going to defend them,""
he says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company has no other comment. 
  Whether Braveheart or any of the other partnerships involved deception that
could constitute civil or criminal fraud is a question that federal
investigators are only beginning to explore in their probes of Enron and its
auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP. Irving Einhorn, former head of the Securities and
Exchange Commission's Los Angeles office, says a company or individual can be
held liable in a civil lawsuit for failing to ""disclose all material facts""
that might influence a ""reasonable investor to invest or not invest."" To prove
criminal fraud, a prosecutor must show ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that a
defendant intended to mislead, Mr. Einhorn says. ""You look for a guilty state
of mind."" 
  Andersen's possible role in signing off on the structure of some or all of
the partnerships came into the spotlight Tuesday. The Big Five accounting firm
announced it had fired a partner in its Houston office who oversaw the Enron
account because he allegedly ordered the destruction of related e-mails and
documents. The Braveheart partnership was vetted and approved by Enron's
internal risk department and by Andersen, Mr. McMahon says. 
  As Enron's ambitions grew more diverse in the late 1990s, getting into
telecommunications struck some executives as appealing. In 1998, the company
launched a new unit with the idea of obtaining fiber-optic lines over which it
could deliver business data and entertainment. The unit, headed by Kenneth
Rice, a right-hand man of Enron's then-chief executive, Jeffrey Skilling, also
pioneered the trading of access to fiber-optic, or ""broadband,"" networks it and
others would control. 
  Enron in 1998 acquired Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility that had
a budding fiber-optic network for phone and data traffic in the Pacific
Northwest. Enron expanded the network aggressively, hoping that businesses
would use it during weekdays to send information, while on nights and weekends,
consumers could receive movies on demand. 
  The Blockbuster venture announced in July 2000 was supposed to provide the
movies, which customers could control with a TV set-top box. Viewers would
select from a catalogue expected eventually to contain thousands of titles and
watch them whenever they wanted to for about the price of a rental. 
  With the Blockbuster venture under way, Enron incorporated its Braveheart
venture in Delaware on Dec. 28, 2000, giving it the legal name EBS Content
Systems LLC, according to Delaware public records. Internal Enron documents
describing Braveheart show a complicated financial structure in which there
were three classes of stock but EBS exercised effective control. Enron assigned
the partnership a value of $124.8 million based on its projections of the
revenue and earnings potential of the Blockbuster venture, according to the
company documents.

Blockbuster Deal -2: Partnership Ill-Structured
2002-01-16 23:09 (New York)

  From The Wall Street Journal 

  These documents indicate that Enron sought to structure the partnership so
that 3% of it was owned by outside investors. That is the minimum amount
required for such a partnership to be considered a legitimate ""arms-length""
entity, separate from the company or person creating it, according to the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, the accounting industry's private
rule-setting organization. Achieving this status would allow Enron to treat
Braveheart's finances separately, rather than as part of Enron's own balance
sheet, and shield the partnership from public scrutiny. 
  To begin to piece together the 3% outside interest, Enron went to nCUBE, a
technology company controlled by Oracle's Mr. Ellison. The Portland, Ore.,
company, which as a contractor was supplying the Blockbuster venture with
computer hardware, also made a $2 million investment in Braveheart in late
2000, says Michael Pohl, nCube's president. Mr. Pohl says Enron promised to
return the $2 million in early 2001. ""It was never a long-term thing,"" he adds.

  Enron still needed another $1.74 million to hit the 3% goal. It obtained the
money from another partnership, known as SE Thunderbird LLC, according to the
company documents. Defining this as outside money was complicated, since Enron
itself owned 71.5% of SE Thunderbird, while outsiders owned 28.5%. (SE
Thunderbird's ostensible purpose couldn't be determined.) 
  Here is how Enron got to 3%, according to the documents: The company took
$7.1 million from SE Thunderbird and moved it to Braveheart. Enron classified
28.5% of that -- or about $2 million -- as outside money. That meant that the
3% threshold had been exceeded. 
  Andersen signed off on the structure of the deal and the $124.8 million
valuation of the Braveheart partnership assigned by Enron, according to the
company documents. Andersen spokesman David Tabolt says the accounting firm
can't talk about the Braveheart venture ""due to client-confidentiality issues.""

  In exchange for its $115.2 million investment, CIBC was supposed to receive
93% of Braveheart's cash flow for 10 years. But Enron made the investment in
the embryonic partnership more attractive by promising to repay CIBC the full
value of its investment if the partnership failed to be a money maker. 
  Three former Enron employees familiar with the partnership deals say that
this kind of guarantee was designed specifically to attract investors who
otherwise might worry about the viability of the deals. ""The banks didn't care
about the assets they invested in, and that's how it got out of control,"" says
one former Enron employee who helped create some of the partnerships. 
  In late November, CIBC said its total unsecured potential losses related to
Enron amounted to $115 million. That amount is roughly equal to the sum CIBC
invested in Braveheart. The bank also said it has secured-debt exposure to
Enron of another $100 million. Citing ""client confidentiality,"" Rob McLeod, a
CIBC spokesman, declined yesterday to comment on its investment in Braveheart
or other Enron partnerships. 
  Mr. Pohl, the nCube president, says his company is ""still on the hook for
that $2 million"" it invested in Braveheart and is considering filing a claim
with the U.S. bankruptcy court in New York. 
  Raising money, such as the CIBC investment, through its partnerships was
essential to Enron. Andrew Fastow, then chief financial officer, discussed the
issue in general before the finance committee of the company's board of
directors in October 2000. Mr. Fastow was involved in putting many of the
partnerships in motion, although he apparently didn't play a direct role in
Braveheart, according to Mr. McMahon. Mr. Fastow told the board members that
the company needed a ""private-equity strategy"" that would fund ""significant
capital investments by the company, some of which would not generate cash flow
or earnings for a number of years,"" according to excerpts of minutes of the
meeting. The capital investments included Enron's plans to expand trading of
such things as broadband access. 
  A lawyer for Mr. Fastow didn't return a phone call seeking comment. 
  Enron began using Braveheart for accounting purposes in the fourth quarter of
2000. For that period, Enron claimed its ownership of Braveheart resulted in a
$53 million profit, even though the Blockbuster venture was only two weeks into
its pilot program and not generating any profit at all. 
  One of the former Enron employees familiar with Braveheart recalls wondering
at the time, "" `How can they monetize this asset when we're still putting it
together?' It didn't make any sense to me."" 
  In the following quarter, the first of 2001, Enron claimed an additional
$57.9 million gain from Braveheart. ""I was just floored,"" says the former
employee. ""I mean, I couldn't believe it."" At the time, the Blockbuster venture
was just starting in New York, Seattle, Portland, Ore., and Salt Lake City, the
former employees say. 
  The profits Enron claimed in its public financial disclosures contributed to
the impression that its broadband unit was promising, although still losing
money overall, and that the parent company's earnings were growing in line with
Enron's rising stock price. As a result of Braveheart's contribution, Enron
Broadband's losses were limited to a total of $67 million during the two
quarters. 
  At a stock analysts' meeting in Houston in January 2001, Enron presented
printed material in which it said it had achieved ""critical mass roll-out of
broadband services strategy"" in 2000. The material added that Enron's ""premium
content-delivery business [was] firmly established."" Enron told the analysts
that the broadband-content business eventually would generate $45 billion in
revenue, although it wasn't stated over what time period that would occur. 
  Analysts around this time continued recommending Enron stock as a ""strong
buy."" The stock was trading at close to its all-time peak of $90. 
  Mr. McMahon, who replaced Mr. Fastow as Enron's chief financial officer in
October, now says that timing and atmosphere were critical to obtaining the
CIBC investment in Braveheart. In late 2000, ""the whole thought was that the
market was hot for broadband services,"" he says. 
  But by March 2001, the marriage between Blockbuster and Enron was on the
rocks. Both sides pointed fingers about what went wrong. After terminating the
pilot program, the two companies vowed to press ahead on their own in
delivering video on demand. 
  Termination of the Blockbuster deal, though, created accounting problems for
Enron. Braveheart had lost its source of potential revenue. 
  Pressed by analysts and investors to explain its many opaque partnership
deals, Enron in October announced a stunning third-quarter loss of $618
million. Lumped into that amount were losses from Braveheart -- basically a
reversal of the $110.9 million in profits it had claimed earlier -- as well as
losses related to soured investments in water-utilities and retail-energy
businesses. 
  Within weeks, there were more disastrous financial announcements, word that
the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating and a growing sense
that the once-mighty company was headed for insolvency.

Pricewaterhouse, KPMG Have A Link To Enron
2002-01-16 22:25 (New York)

  By Henny Sender and Susanne Craig 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

  Accounting giants PricewaterhouseCoopers LP and KPMG LLP became the third and
fourth Big Five accounting firms to have a role in the Enron Corp. meltdown,
though they so far appear to have had only bit parts. 
  Pricewaterhouse provided advice to the energy-trading firm in connection with
two now-controversial partnerships with which Enron did business, people
familiar with the matter say. Specifically, Pricewaterhouse's role was to
provide an opinion to Enron about the fairness of the proceeds that Enron
received when it transferred assets to the two partnerships. KPMG provided the
independent auditor's report on the two partnerships, according to a spokesman.

  Various partnerships figure prominently in Enron's spiral into bankruptcy
court. While these partnerships were marketed as investment opportunities to a
small group of investors, in fact they came to serve as a sort of
off-balance-sheet dumping ground for bad assets and securities, critics now
contend. 
  Pricewaterhouse's valuation advice concerned assets transferred to LJM Cayman
LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, two partnerships set up by Andrew S. Fastow,
Enron's former chief financial officer, at the time he worked for the company. 
  References to Pricewaterhouse appear in internal Enron documents dated June
28, 1999. At that time, the Enron board discussed the transfer of an investment
worth $50 million to the first LJM partnership. It is standard practice for
accounting firms to make such appraisals on asset transfers, according to
Jeffrey Cohen, who heads the securities-law practice for Coudert Brothers in
New York, speaking generally. A spokesman for Pricewaterhouse says the firm
isn't currently an auditor, and never has been, of either partnership and has
never participated in, or given accounting advice to, Enron on its consolidated
statements. 
  Pricewaterhouse's link to Enron appears less controversial than that of rival
Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor. The links between Arthur Andersen and
Enron are now the subject of multiple government investigations. In 2000, Enron
paid Arthur Andersen $27 million for nonaudit work and $25 million in audit
fees. 
  The other Big Five firm to be touched by the Enron scandal is Deloitte &
Touche LLP, which in a Dec. 21 report gave Andersen a clean bill of health as
part of a ""peer review."" Though Deloitte noted what it described as a few minor
shortcomings, it found no cause for any action against Andersen and said
Andersen's system of accounting and audit quality control provided ""reasonable
assurance of compliance with professional standards."" Deloitte says its review
is in accordance with all prevailing standards. 
  Separately, three Canadian institutional investors that invested more than
$175 million in Enron debt securities in October filed a wrongful-conduct
lawsuit against the company's investment bankers and auditor. The suit, filed
yesterday in federal court in Manhattan, names Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney
unit, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp.'s Banc of America
Securities LLC and accounting firm Arthur Andersen. The plantiffs are
investment managers based in Toronto: Silvercreek Management Inc. and two of
its funds, Onex Industrial Partners Ltd. and Pebble Limited Partnership. Bank
of America, Goldman and Andersen couldn't be reached for comment. Salomon Smith
Barney declined to comment. 
  Calls to Enron weren't returned. Enron officials initially said they set up
the partnerships to minimize financial risk; in November, they conceded that
some of the partnership transactions were improperly accounted for.


McKinsey Held Close Enron Ties For Many Years
2002-01-16 23:00 (New York)

  By Suein Hwang and Rachel Emma Silverman 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

  Back in the heady days of October 2000, at a sumptuous hotel ballroom in Palm
Beach, the finance committee of Enron Corp.'s board heard then-Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow describe Enron's need for outside private partnerships to
help drive the company's explosive growth -- partnerships that would sow the
seeds of Enron's current woes. 
  According to internal company documents, one outsider also attended that
meeting: Richard N. Foster, a senior partner with McKinsey & Co. 
  Mr. Foster was an advisor to Enron's board between October 2000 and October
2001 and attended about six board meetings, according to a McKinsey spokesman.
Indeed, the celebrated consulting firm was a major force at Enron almost from
the company's birth in the mid-'80s. McKinsey was where former Enron CEO Jeff
Skilling worked before jumping to Enron, and McKinsey was instrumental in
advising Enron during its decade-long transformation from a
natural-gas-pipeline company into a massively complex trading operation with
far-flung interests in water, timber, and high-speed Internet. McKinsey
typically stationed its own personnel at Enron's offices, and dispatched about
five to 15 consultants to the Houston headquarters to advise on strategy and
operations, according to former Enron executives. 
  At a time when Enron's collapse is churning up thorny ethical and legal
problems for its accountants, lawyers and executives, the question arises: How
accountable should McKinsey, its strategy advisor, be? Though courts generally
haven't found consultants liable for their advice, McKinsey's long and close
relationship to Enron inevitably raises questions about how much the company
knew about financial irregularities that only surfaced last summer. 
  A McKinsey spokesman said: ""In serving Enron, McKinsey was not retained to
provide advice to Enron or any Enron-affiliated entity with respect to the
company's financial reporting strategy, methods of financing, methods of
disclosure, investment partnerships or off-balance-sheet financing vehicles."" 
  In exchange for its strategic advice to Enron, McKinsey received millions of
dollars in consulting fees. When Enron's stock began to soar, the consulting
firm made the Enron success story a cornerstone of the management gospel it
preaches in part to woo other clients. 
  In an article published in the March 22, 1997, edition of its academic
publication, McKinsey Quarterly, the authors celebrated Enron's ""new breed of
tightly focused and vertically specialized `petropreneurs.'"" Later in that same
article, Mc-Kinsey writers extolled how Enron had created a trading, finance
and risk management business worth more than $250 million in five years, and
how ""its deployment of off-balance-sheet funds using institutional investment
money fostered its securitization skills and granted it access to capital at
below the hurdle rates of major oil companies."" 
  Though such writings suggest McKinsey knew about Enron's extensive use of
off-balance sheet funds, there is no indication that anyone at the consulting
firm knew fully how Enron was using those partnerships. Late last year, Enron
had to restate four years of earnings because of improper accounting for some
of those entities. 
  A McKinsey spokesman said it was a 75-year old policy of the firm not to
comment specifically on client matters. 
  Enron also played a featured role in McKinsey-partner Mr. Foster's recent
book ""Creative Destruction,"" published last year. ""How do the concepts of
control, permission and risk fit together?"" asked authors Mr. Foster and Sarah
Kaplan, a former McKinsey employee. ""Enron offers one good example of managing
these elements to a favorable outcome."" 
  Speaking on behalf of Mr Foster, a McKinsey spokesman said ""the main thesis
of Creative Destruction is that in the long run markets outperform companies
because companies have not yet found a way to change at the pace and scale of
the markets without losing control."" Enron didn't return calls seeking comment
about Mc-Kinsey's relationship with Enron. 
  McKinsey has seen rocky times of late. The slowing economy has impacted the
firm, forcing McKinsey to trim its work force last year. McKinsey was embroiled
in a public display of finger-pointing with a Chinese computer firm last year,
and the firm parted ways with Swissair after an ambitious plan it devised was
blamed for the airline's collapse. McKinsey declined to comment on those
relationships as well. 
  Enron could represent more than just an embarrassing client for McKinsey. Its
plunge into bankruptcy has sparked numerous investigations, as congressional
leaders and others search to understand what drove its collapse, which jolted
financial markets and left thousands of its current and former employees with
little or no retirement savings. McKinsey says it has not been contacted by
government investigators regarding Enron. 
  Though there is no indication that McKinsey may itself become a subject of
investigation, it could be caught up as a third party in the investigation of
its client. Legal experts say McKinsey, unlike Enron's lawyers and accountants,
has no privilege of confidentiality that would shield it from disclosing
information to government investigators. 
  For decades, McKinsey has been revered -- even feared -- for its influence in
boardrooms and its extensive and powerful old-boy network among major
corporations. Its alumni list reads like a who's who of the Fortune 500,
including the likes of IBM Corp. Chief Executive Lou Gerstner. In recent years,
that network has helped privately held McKinsey win lucrative consulting
contracts from companies run by its former partners. 
  Mr. Skilling, a vital bridge between McKinsey and Enron, described McKinsey's
approach in an interview with this newspaper in 1993, three years after joining
Enron: ""In the old days, we'd do one project and go away,"" he said of his days
at McKinsey. But over time, ""the relationships got closer and bigger."" 
  McKinsey was central to Enron's ""asset-light"" strategy, the notion of
building an industrial powerhouse with few hard assets; McKinsey also advised
Enron as it considered entering new businesses, according to former Enron
executives. In one McKinsey Quarterly article in 1999, the consultants praised
Enron's water-industry investment, ""despite a lack of obvious linkages to
energy,"" they wrote, ""as a chance to leverage intangibles such as project
management, network operations, and infrastructure development skills."" The
water foray ended in disaster last October, when Enron took a $287 million
write-off to exit the business. 
  One former executive who developed and managed power projects said he was
ordered to check with McKinsey when he wanted to make an arcane type of
gas-transmission investment. A team of McKinsey experts was sent to Enron's
offices to check out the deal. ""They were all over the place,"" he says. 
  Suggestions that McKinsey was a ""decision maker or a necessary review body on
Enron's asset investments are flat-out wrong,"" McKinsey says.


Enron Board's Actions Raise Liability Questions
2002-01-16 23:00 (New York)

  By Joann S. Lublin and John R. Emshwiller 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

  It is a queasy time to be an Enron Corp. director. 
  This week's disclosure that the board of the collapsed Houston energy company
twice waived the corporate ethics code to allow creation of controversial
partnerships raises significant red flags about directors' potential liability.
According to a report that Houston law firm Vinson & Elkins prepared for Enron,
the full board twice suspended the company's ethics code during 1999 in order
to allow two outside partnerships to be headed by a top Enron executive who
stood to financially benefit from them. 
  The subsequent widespread disclosure of those partnerships last fall fueled
Enron's downward spiral toward a bankruptcy-court filing. 
  The law-firm report could increase Enron directors' legal exposure and
represents another example of ""a culture of sloppiness on conflict-of-interest
issues,"" says Nell Minow, a veteran shareholder activist and editor of the
Corporate Library, an online database of corporate-governance information.
Enron board members seem to have ""a real sense of unreality about conflicts of
interest,"" she adds. 
  An Enron spokeswoman didn't have any comment yesterday. In the past, the
company has defended its actions regarding the partnerships. Also, individual
Enron directors didn't return phone calls or couldn't be reached to comment. 
  Things could soon get even messier for its 15-member board. Several insurance
carriers that underwrite liability coverage for Enron directors and officers
are exploring ways they might suspend their policies, says an individual close
to the situation. One possibility: declare that Enron misled insurers by
renewing D&O policies based on earnings that it subsequently restated. In
November, weeks before its bankruptcy-court filing, Enron reduced its
previously reported net income dating back to 1997 by $586 million, or 20%,
mostly due to improperly accounting for its dealings with partnerships run by
some company officers. 
  It is increasingly common for insurance companies to seek rescission of D&O
policies ""based on fraudulent applications"" for new or renewed coverage, says
Stephen Weiss, a partner with Holland & Knight, a Washington law firm and an
expert on D&O insurance. ""A restatement in earnings can certainly raise the
specter of insurers seeking to rescind their policies on the basis of apparent
fraud."" 
  A spokesman for Minnesota-based St. Paul Cos., one of Enron's providers of
D&O insurance, declined to comment on whether it will maintain coverage. 
  Canceling such coverage following earnings restatements doesn't always get
insurers off the hook, however. Consider Sunbeam Corp. 
  A unit of New York-based American International Group Inc. dropped liability
insurance for Sunbeam directors and officers shortly after the Boca Raton,
Fla., consumer-products concern restated financial results for the six quarters
ended March 31, 1998. The restatement covered essentially the entire tenure of
Albert J. Dunlap, who was ousted as chairman and chief executive in mid-1998
amid massive accounting irregularities. 
  Sunbeam subsequently sued the AIG unit in federal district court in Miami,
seeking restoration of its halted coverage. Under a settlement reached early
last year, the AIG unit agreed to pay Sunbeam $10 million -- but refused to
reinstate the canceled policy, informed individuals say. 
  The extent of Enron directors' potential liability for waiving the ethics
code may depend on whether a court decides this was intentional misconduct.
""Any time [directors] abrogate a company's code of conduct, you raise serious
questions,"" said Charles Elson, a board member at three publicly traded
concerns who runs the University of Delaware business school's Center for
Corporate Governance. ""Are their actions reckless or negligent?"" 
  On the other hand, Mr. Weiss noted that corporate codes of ethics sometimes
permit waivers under appropriate circumstances. You can't automatically assume
that suspending an ethics code is wrong, he added. 
  At Enron, the first waiver was in June 1999, when finance chief Andrew Fastow
was looking to set up a private partnership to be known as LJM Cayman LP.
Because the partnership would do business with Enron, Mr. Fastow needed a
special ruling from the board that his activities wouldn't violate company
rules on outside business interests. 
  According to an excerpt of the minutes of the company's June 28, 1999, board
meeting, there was a ""discussion"" of Mr. Fastow's involvement in the LJM
partnership. The minutes don't go into details about what was discussed.
However, the board adopted a resolution that ratified a recommendation from top
management that Mr. Fastow's partnership participation ""will not adversely
affect the interests of the Company,"" according to the minutes. 
  Directors' approval of the partnership also included ""waiver of Enron's code
of ethics to permit Mr. Fastow to act as the general partner"" of the
partnership, the Vinson report stated. 
  The waiver involved a suspension of corporate policies intended to protect
against executives being involved in activities that might pose a conflict of
interest or be detrimental to Enron. Later that year, Mr. Fastow was looking to
set up the larger and more ambitious LJM2 Co-Investment LP. (LJM Cayman had $16
million from outside investors; LJM2 had nearly $400 million.) 
  An excerpt from an Oct. 11, 1999, meeting of the finance committee of Enron's
board recounts Mr. Fastow telling the committee that Enron's ""Conduct of
Business Affairs Policies"" would ""prohibit him from participating in LJM2 as
managing partner . . . absent appropriate reviews and waivers from the Board.""
The excerpt shows that the finance panel voted to recommend such a waiver to
the full board. 
  The next day, Oct. 12, the full board approved that waiver for Mr. Fastow on
LJM2. The resolution used essentially the same language as in the case of LJM
Cayman. 
  Enron estimates that Mr. Fastow eventually made over $30 million from the two
partnerships. 
  Enron has between $250 million and $350 million in current D&O coverage, says
a person close to the situation. But even if the firm retains all its insurance
for directors and officers, no one knows if that will be enough to cope with
the pending litigation. The full board is named in nearly all of the 50 pending
shareholder derivative suits. 

New memo uncovered in Enron probe
January 17, 2002 Posted: 1:44 a.m. EST (0644 GMT)

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee uncovered another memo Wednesday from Enron whistleblower Sherron Watkins detailing her concerns about the company's problems -- this one describing a phone call in which she shared her worries with a partner at Arthur Andersen. 

The latest memo -- dated August 20 -- indicated she called a senior official at Andersen, who was also a friend of hers, and talked about her concerns. 
Watkins later wrote a seven-page memo to Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay that said she was worried that ""... we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals."" 
Andersen, the energy giant's accounting firm, is also under scrutiny in probes on the fall of Enron, which declared bankruptcy in December. 
After speaking to Watkins, the senior official convened a meeting with three Andersen partners, including David Duncan, the Anderson partner overseeing the Enron audit, a source told CNN. Duncan has since been fired. 
The accounting firm said Duncan, a former lead partner in the firm's Houston office, instructed others to destroy Enron documents, but a spokesman for Duncan said he acted on the advice of an in-house Andersen lawyer. 
Duncan was quizzed Wednesday by eight investigators for the House Energy and Commerce Committee -- one of several committees and subcommittees probing the collapse of Enron. The meeting was not public. 
The Enron scandal began when the energy company, with $62.8 billion in assets, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection December 2. Many Enron employees had invested most of their 401(k) savings in company stock and lost much of their life savings when it went bust. 
Latest developments
* The White House refused to say whether it was conducting a formal review to determine if Enron officials contacted more government officials. Press secretary Ari Fleischer, in a somewhat contentious exchange with reporters, said the administration planned to look into contacts between Bush administration officials and Enron executives only if there are any allegations of wrongdoing or in response to specific questions. 
* The FBI sent out an internal bulletin seeking 38 agents who are also certified public accountants to relocate to Houston to staff the Enron task force, officials told CNN Wednesday. 
* According to a report by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, who has been critical of the White House for not releasing records related to the closed-door meetings of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force, ""there are at least 17 policies in the White House energy plan that were advocated by Enron or that benefited Enron."" A spokeswoman for Cheney dismissed the Waxman report as ""election-year maneuvering.""  
* Sen. Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, warned the Justice Department Wednesday it might have a conflict of interest with Arthur Andersen. In a letter to Deputy Attorney General Lawrence Thompson, Leahy, D-Vermont, noted that the accounting firm has a contract worth more than $700,000 with the Justice Department to complete a review of the FBI as it undergoes a reorganization. 
* A former federal regulator said Enron tried to manipulate U.S. energy policy. Curtis Hebert Jr., a former commissioner with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the Clinton administration, said in an interview with CNN: ""Everything they espoused to Congress and to state leaders was always what's in the best interests of Enron, never what's in the best interests of American energy companies.""(


Enron Auditor Questioned by House Investigators (Update)
2002-01-16 21:05 (New York)

     (Adds Enron executive's call to Andersen in August in second
and 10th through 15th paragraphs.)

     Washington, Jan. 16 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. House investigators
interviewed David Duncan, the Arthur Andersen LLP partner who
oversaw Enron Corp.'s audit, about his role in destroying
thousands of e-mails and documents related to the collapse of the
largest energy trader.
     Duncan answered questions from investigators of the Energy
and Commerce Committee for 4 1/2 hours, a day after Andersen said
it fired him for ordering the document destruction in October
after the Securities and Exchange Commission asked for information
about Enron's books. A committee member also said an Enron
executive raised concerns with Andersen about accounting
irregularities in August.
     ``It was an informal interview,'' Ken Johnson, a committee
spokesman, said of the meeting with Duncan. ``He was not sworn-in,
but was warned about giving false testimony. He fully
cooperated.''
     The committee, six other Congressional panels and the Justice
Department are investigating the unraveling of Enron, which filed
the largest bankruptcy in history last month. Hearings, which
begin next Tuesday, will focus on the partnerships the Houston-
based company created to hide debt, Andersen's conduct and the
secrecy of energy trading.
    The loss of documents from Andersen may go beyond negligent or
unethical behavior, particularly in light of a Securities and
Exchange Commission probe, Johnson said earlier in the day.
     ``It might have been illegal,'' he said.

                         Bound for Houston

     Duncan provided investigators with some leads to pursue,
Johnson said, refusing to give details. Tomorrow and Friday
investigators from Congress will be in Houston to interview more
people, he said.
     Democrats said Duncan's statements did not answer all the
questions they had about Enron's accounting and transactions.
     ``Our investigators were disappointed by the limited nature
of Mr. Duncan's memory,'' said Laura Sheehan, a spokesman for
Representative John Dingell, senior Democrat on the panel. ``We
expect documents and other witnesses to fill in the blanks.''
     Andersen had indications there were questions being raised
about how some of Enron's partnerships were being accounted for
before the SEC requested information in October, Representative
James Greenwood, a member of the house panel, said. The questions
came from within Enron.

                             A Warning

     Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins warned Enron Chairman
Kenneth Lay on Aug. 16 of looming ``accounting scandals,''
according to a copy of the memo she wrote that was released by the
committee. Greenwood, a Pennsylvania Republican, said that Watkins
followed up that warning with a telephone call to an Andersen
audit partner on Aug. 20.
     Details about the call were given in an internal Andersen
memorandum, Greenwood said.
     ``This document raises additional concerns about Andersen's
knowledge of potential accounting irregularities and the
subsequent destruction of Enron-related documents,'' Greenwood
said in a statement.
     Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for Andersen, said the company
contacted Enron's general counsel after Watkins' call and was told
that Enron had begun investigating.
     ``What additional steps were taken, we're still looking at,''
Dorton said. ``We're still trying to learn all the facts.''

                      Pressing for Punishment

     Andersen's firing of Duncan and its decision to place three
other partners on administrative leave yesterday may not satisfy
government officials, some of whom are pressing for prosecution of
employees and changes in accounting procedures.
     ``If rules were broken, rule breakers should be punished,''
Peter Fisher, the Treasury Department's undersecretary for
domestic finance, said during a speech today to insurance
executives in Boca Raton, Florida. ``If rules were bent, we should
improve the means of enforcing those rules.''
     Enron executives in October and early November asked Fisher
to contact banks on behalf of the company, a request he rejected.
     Bush administration officials also are attracting scrutiny
because of their own ties to Enron and Andersen.
     SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said he's not managing his agency's
investigation of Enron or Andersen and that he may disqualify
himself from any involvement. Pitt represented Andersen in his
private law practice.
     Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, wrote in a letter to the Justice Department that he was
concerned that Andersen may have access to confidential
information from the FBI. Andersen has a $700,000 contract to
study and advise the FBI on some internal operations, including
its computer system.
     Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, who is leading the
Justice Department investigation, said the consulting unit hired
by the FBI is ``different and separate'' from Andersen's
accounting unit.

                           Stock Trading

     Democrats also are calling for more information on whether
administration officials got any inside information from Enron
before selling the stock.
     ``If Hillary Clinton had sold millions of dollars of stock
like the secretary of the Army did, some of my colleagues on the
other side would be raising questions,'' said Representative Peter
Deutsch, senior Democrat on a House subcommittee probing Enron.
     Before joining the administration, Army Secretary Thomas
White was vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, an Enron
subsidiary.
     Representative Henry Waxman of California, senior Democrat on
the House Government Reform panel, again raised questions about
Enron's access to Vice President Dick Cheney's Energy Task Force.
The White House last week disclosed that Enron representatives met
with Cheney or his staff six times before completion of the
report.
     Waxman released a report saying at least 17 policies
recommended by Cheney's task force benefited Enron, including
support for trading energy derivatives and proposals to aid
natural gas projects.
     Waxman urged the White House to release to the non-partisan
General Accounting Office all records of industry contacts with
the energy task force.
     ``This creates the unfortunate appearance that a large
contributor received special access and obtained extraordinarily
favorable results in the White House energy plan,'' Waxman wrote
in a letter to Cheney today.
     Revelations about the document destruction also have drawn
the scrutiny of a California state Senate committee, which today
decided to subpoena Enron to determine if Andersen destroyed
documents that they were seeking last June. The panel decided not
to subpoena Andersen. The Senate subpoenaed documents in June as
part of a probe into whether power companies manipulated
California's energy market.


Arthur Andersen Knew Of Enron Woes A Year Ago
2002-01-17 00:00 (New York)

  By Tom Hamburger and Ken Brown 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

  WASHINGTON -- Arthur Andersen LLP officials discussed Enron Corp.'s
aggressive accounting practices and potential conflicts of interest at a
February 2001 meeting called to decide whether to retain the energry-trading
company as a client, an internal memo from the accounting firm shows. 
  A second memo, cited by congressional investigators, shows that an Enron
executive who warned the company's chief executive that it was in danger of
being swamped by accounting irregularities also voiced concerns to Andersen in
August 2001. 
  The first memo -- drafted Feb. 6, 2001, by an Andersen auditor on the Enron
account named Michael Jones -- recounts a meeting the day before of Andersen
executives about whether the accounting firm should continue working for Enron.
Such a ""retention meeting,"" as the memo calls it, isn't unusual in itself. But,
the memo recounts the executives discussing many of the alleged problems that
have become the focus of criminal, civil and congressional investigations into
Enron's collapse. Enron, of Houston, filed for bankruptcy-court protection
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Dec. 2, the largest such filing
ever, and investigators increasingly are focusing on Andersen's role. 
  ""Significant discussion was held regarding the related-party transactions
with LJM, including the materiality of such amounts to Enron's income statement
and the amount retained `off balance sheet,' "" the memo says, referring to a
private partnership that kept Enron debt off the company's books. The memo
specifically mentions ""conflicts of interest"" by then-Enron Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow, who controlled that partnership and others like it, and
the fact that he received compensation from it. 
  Such partnership arrangements contributed greatly to Enron's collapse.
Widespread publicity of them last fall caused a crisis of investor confidence
in the company that helped drive down the company's stock. Written eight months
before Enron's downward spiral began, the memo raises nearly every accounting
issue that led to the energy-trading company's downfall, including its need to
maintain a high credit rating. Decisions by rating agencies to downgrade
Enron's rating were followed soon after by the company's bankruptcy filing. 
  The memo describes discussions of how the partnership transactions were
described in footnotes in Enron financial statements and mentions efforts to
make sure Andersen auditors ""fully understand the economics and substance of
the transactions."" Another ""significant discussion"" was held about how Enron
valued its earnings on such transactions and ""the fact that it was `intelligent
gambling.' "" The memo notes that Enron was ""aggressive in its transaction
structuring. 
  ""Ultimately, the conclusion was reached to retain Enron as a client [because]
it appeared that we had the appropriate people and processes in place to serve
Enron and manage our engagement risks,"" the memo says. 
  During the discussion, the Andersen executives noted Enron's fees to the firm
eventually could total $100 million a year -- an amount that would have made
Enron the accounting firm's biggest client by far. The executives discussed
whether their decision to retain Enron was colored by the size of the fees, and
the memo suggests they were concerned about whether too much of Andersen's
Enron income was coming from nonaudit advisory work. ""Such amounts did not
trouble the participants as long as the nature of the services was not an
issue,"" the memo says. 
  David Tabolt, an Andersen spokesman, said he was unaware of the memo and the
meeting it recounts. ""I am unable to provide any comment until I look into
this,"" he said. Accounting firms regularly review clients to determine if
auditing the books puts the accounting firm at risk. The Andersen memo doesn't
specify if this was one of those regular meetings or if it was called for a
particular reason. Mr. Tabolt stressed that Andersen doesn't hesitate to drop
risky clients for various reasons. ""We've dumped thousands of clients in recent
years,"" he said. 
  The memo was addressed to two Andersen officials, including David Duncan, who
headed the Enron account and who Andersen this week said it fired for
overseeing the destruction of Enron-related documents after learning that
federal regulators were examining the energy-trading company's finances. 
  Mr. Duncan was quizzed at length yesterday by investigators for the House
Energy and Commerce Committee and the Justice Department in separate,
closed-door sessions. Much of the congressional questions related to the
February 2001 memo. Mr. Duncan told the investigators he called the meeting
because he was aware the Enron account posed ""significant risk,"" according to
one person present during the questioning. The memo provided a ""To Do"" list
that included recommending that Enron's board review the fairness of
transactions with the LJM partnership. Asked whether he followed up on that and
other items on the list, Mr. Duncan answered ""no"" to most, often suggesting it
was the responsibility of others at the accounting firm. 
  The second memo, by another Andersen executive, recounts an Aug. 20, 2001,
phone conversation with Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, a former Andersen
employee who that same month alerted Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay to
possible conflicts of interest and potential accounting irregularities that she
feared could bring the company down. 
  Congressional aides who have read the memo said it shows that Ms. Watkins
detailed her concerns about Enron to an Andersen auditor. The three-page memo
indicates Ms. Watkins's concerns were relayed to senior Andersen management,
including Mr. Duncan. 
  Ken Johnson, spokesman for committee Chairman Billy Tauzin (R., La.), said
the memo was apparently written after a meeting of Andersen executives to
discuss Ms. Watkins's warnings. The internal memo includes a summary of Ms.
Watkins's allegations and concludes by noting that the officials from Andersen
""agreed to consult with our firm's legal adviser about what actions to take."" 
  ""This document raises additional concerns about Andersen's knowledge of
potential accounting irregularities and the subsequent destruction of
Enron-related documents,"" said Rep. James Greenwood (R., Pa.), chairman of the
Energy and Commerce's oversight subcommittee. 
  Andersen's Mr. Tabolt acknowledged the accounting firm knew about Ms.
Watkins's issues with Enron's finances. ""We were made aware of her concerns and
we confirmed that Enron's general counsel was aware and we were advised that
the CEO was being notified, and we were told that Vinson & Elkins [Enron's law
firm] was doing an investigation,"" Mr. Tabolt said. ""We think that that was the
right thing to do."" 
  Andersen had a major financial incentive to keep Enron, which paid $52
million in auditing and other fees to Andersen in 2000 alone. ""There are a lot
of $25 million clients, but $50 million clients, Enron might have been it,"" a
former Andersen partner said. 
  The Houston office was one of Andersen's biggest and most profitable, mainly
because it dominates the auditing of the oil-and-gas industry, handling by some
estimates 80% of its mid- and large-size companies. ""Texas is a stronghold,""
the former partner said. Indeed, Andersen employs more than 1,400 people in
Houston and boasts that it is the biggest of the Big Five accounting firms in
the city, even though it is the smallest of the Big Five overall.

Arthur Andersen Confronts Role In Enron Debacle
2002-01-16 20:48 (New York)

  By Vanessa O'Connell, Wall Street Journal

  ARTHUR ANDERSEN has a message for those who think the Enron scandal will
bring the accounting firm down: This saga isn't over yet. 
  In a full-page newspaper ad yesterday, Joseph Berardino, the firm's chief
executive, sought to assure the public that ""Andersen will do what is right.""
The declaration of intent, which appeared in The Wall Street Journal, the New
York Times and the Washington Post, was Andersen's first significant effort to
convince the public that it will survive the financial scandal now unfolding.
In crisis-management situations, newspaper ads from chief executives have
become a common first step. 
  Andersen's reputation suffered a major blow after the disclosure that its
employees shredded key documents related to Enron's shaky financial condition.
Andersen, Enron's auditing firm, now is a subject of a Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation. Until recently, the crisis has been handled almost
exclusively by Andersen's internal public-relations team, led by David Tabolt,
a former editor and reporter for the Associated Press. Mr. Tabolt, 51 years
old, joined Andersen in 1999 following stints at some public-relations firms. 
  But last week, Mr. Tabolt and the Andersen public-relations team were given
some outside help. At the suggestion of its outside lawyers and lobbyists,
Andersen hired the big guns at the Washington crisis-management team Chlopak,
Leonard, Schechter & Associates, a unit of Omnicom Group. 
  Formed in 1992 by three former political communications strategists, Chlopak,
Leonard specializes in managing a client's reputation around the globe. Its
clients include the American Red Cross, the organization stung by controversy
last fall when it disclosed that not all the funds collected after the attacks
would go to Sept. 11 causes. The Red Cross later said it would redirect the
money earmarked to help families of victims of the attacks. 
  Charlie Leonard, a partner at the firm, says his firm was part of a team that
suggested Andersen run the ad. ""Advertising is one means of telling the
complete story of what Andersen is willing to do to,"" he says. Mr. Leonard, a
former strategist for the onetime presidential candidate Ross Perot, is the
firm's point person in its efforts to get the scandal under control. 
  The Enron episode marks the third major public-relations fiasco for Andersen
auditors in less than a year. In May, the firm agreed to pay Sunbeam
shareholders $110 million to settle a securities lawsuit. Shortly after that,
Andersen had to pay $20 million to holders of Waste Management after regulators
found accounting problems. 
  Mr. Berardino and his Chicago-based company face a combined legal and
public-relations horror that threatens to destroy the Andersen brand. ""This is
catastrophic for them,"" says Alan Siegel, chief executive of Siegelgale, an
independent branding firm based in New York. ""Not only is this going to hurt
Andersen very much in terms of contracting new business, but it also will be a
distraction for all Andersen employees."" 
  If you haven't noticed the ad yet, keep looking. Andersen intends to expand
its public-image campaign in the coming weeks, as its chief executive seeks to
spread his message to consumers and businesses across the country. Newspapers
in Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Phoenix are expected to begin running the
ad today. 
  Robert Chlopak of Chlopak Leonard says, ""One of the things we try to do is to
encourage our clients to communicate about their actions to show they are
taking responsibility and trying to act in a manner the business community and
public would expect them to,"" he says. ""When an institution like the Red Cross
does that, they tend to fare much better than if they were simply to bunker
down and wait it out.""


DJ Texas Lawmakers Want Probe Into Enron, Arthur Andersen
2002-01-16 22:01 (New York)

  AUSTIN (AP)--A Texas lawmaker on Wednesday asked the state's accounting board
to investigate whether Arthur Andersen LLP. violated state auditing standards
in its handling of Houston-based Enron Corp. 
  The request from state Rep. Steve Wolens, D-Dallas, also  asks the board to
investigate the auditing standards of Enron's accountants. 
  A subcommittee of the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy met Wednesday
but William Treacy, the board's executive director, said he couldn't say if the
committee will recommend that the board investigate. He said possible
investigations are confidential by statute. 
  Wolens, who chairs the House State Affairs Committee, said he asked for the
investigation because ""the acts of destroying thousands of Enron documents
occurred in Texas and the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy has legal
jurisdiction to police accountants for fraud and dishonesty in the performance
of their professional services to Texas,"" Wolens said. 
  Arthur Andersen has said that a ""signficant but undetermined"" number of
documents relating to the failing Enron have been destroyed. 
  Enron Corp. declared bankrupty Dec. 2, after acknowledging that the company
overstated its profits by more than $580 million since 1997. 
  Calls to Arthur Andersen and Enron were not immediately returned. 
  Besides asking the board to investigate whether the companies violated
auditing standards, Wolens also asked the  board to investigate whether Arthur
Andersen or Enron illegally engaged in fraud or dishonesty in the performance
of their services. 
  Wolens also asked the board to investigate: 
  - Whether Arthur Andersen and/or Enron's accountants violated their internal
records' retention policy or the professional records' retention policy. 
  - Whether Enron's accountants subordinated their judgment to Enron's
management. 
  - Whether Arthur Andersen and Enron's accountants violated rules of
professional conduct. 
  In his letter, Wolens said he was disturbed by news reports that Arthur
Andersen destroyed documents related to its work for Enron. 
  The Justice Department is pursuing a criminal investigation of Enron. 
  Arthur Andersen said Tuesday it is firing a senior auditor who organized the
disposal of Enron documents last fall. 
  ""It is important that your office pursue this matter,""  Wolens said in his
letter. ""It is imperative as a matter of public policy to maintain the
integrity of Public Accountancy profession.""


Column: Enron's Political Contacts Key To Scandal
2002-01-16 21:40 (New York)

  By Albert R. Hunt, Wall Street Journal

  At an American Enterprise Institute-sponsored seminar on energy last summer
in Vail, participants, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, White
House counselor Larry Lindsey and some prominent corporate CEOs, were
appropriately deferential to Vice President Cheney. 
  They all referred to him as ""Mr. Vice President"" with one exception: Kenneth
Lay. To the Enron executive, he was ""Dick."" 
  There no longer are Enron apologists. But there are plenty of Bush apologists
on this mushrooming scandal: Not bailing out the now-bankrupt company, they
assert, was a ""tribute to American capitalism."" Enron was a non-partisan
briber, they say, or this is a private industry scandal, not a political one.
Not quite. 
  Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill is right when he says the government
shouldn't have rescued this deceitful company, though arguably he might have
alerted the regulators sooner. But that in no way lessens the shame of a
scandal in which top corporate executives lie to the investing public and bail
out to the tune of more than a billion dollars of their own equity, while
thousands of lower-level employees see their life savings plummet. Government
is necessary to protect against such abuses. 
  If the press, Congress and prosecutors are vigilant, more exposes are
inevitable: Who was cut in on some of Enron's illicit partnerships, what other
governmental favors were given? Let's examine critical connections: 
  The Cheney Connection: Enron's generosity to this administration paid off in
the Bush/Cheney energy plan. The Vice President has largely kept mum on the
details of this connection and the press has been remarkably acquiescent. 
  The General Accounting Office wants to know the role played by vested
interests in the Cheney Task Force. The White House has refused: Only under
pressure recently did Mr. Cheney acknowledge that Ken Lay or Enron had met with
him and his task force on six separate occasions. 
  The principle here is no different than Hillary Clinton's refusal to reveal
the private deliberations involving special interests in assembling her 1993
health-care proposal. The political right justifiably criticized and brought
legal action against her. Mr. Cheney's stonewalling is likewise an attempt to
avoid embarrassing revelations. 
  Yesterday Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman released a report detailing sixteen
provisions of Mr. Cheney's energy recommendations that had been advocated by
Enron. Many, no doubt, would have been included without Enron's input. But when
the details of the secret deliberations emerge -- the only question is when --
it'll be instructive to see what role the Texas company had in proposals for
electricity restructuring, boosting energy production in India or the glowing
description of trading derivatives as ""sophisticated and customizable."" 
  The Bush Connection: Last Thursday, the President of the United States broke
a campaign pledge to restore integrity to the White House. Seeking to distance
himsef from Mr. Lay -- whom he'd affectionately called ""Kenny Boy"" and sent an
effusive birthday greeting a few years ago -- he declared the Enron CEO had
supported his opponent Ann Richards in his first gubernatorial run in 1994. 
  The company did give money to both political parties in that race. But as Mr.
Bush knows, Mr. and Mrs. Lay gave three times more to him, and Mr. Lay endorsed
him. 
  Indeed, over the last eight years, Enron has given over $700,000 dollars to
George W. Bush -- more than any other donor -- and more than it's given to
anyone else. Mr. Lay was one of the ""Pioneers,"" raising more than $100,000 for
the Bush presidential quest. The company contributed to the Florida recount
fund and the Bush inaugural festivities as well. And Mr. Bush has been
appreciative. While governor, his regulators were Enron-friendly. He even
lobbied his friend, then-Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge, on behalf of Enron. 
  These close ties continued in the Bush presidency. Curtis Hebert Jr., then
chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said Mr. Lay told him he
could stay on as chairman if he changed his views on electricity deregulation.
He didn't, and not too long afterwards President Bush replaced him with an old
Enron ally from Texas. Sen. Joe Lieberman should put Messrs. Herbert and Lay
under oath about this conversation when he holds hearings next week. 
  The Contribution Connection: The greatest canard in the miserable saga is
that because the government didn't bail out Enron in October, it proves the
company's massive campaign contributions didn't work. Actually, some of this
sleazy scam might not have occurred if not for the special favors Enron got
from its connections and 6 million in contributions over the past 12 years --
to Democrats as well as Republicans. 
  Sen. Phil Gramm and his wife Wendy are the Enron ""poster couple."" She took
care of the company's interests as head of the Commodity Futures Training
Commission then was handsomely rewarded as a director and member of its
so-called audit committee. As a senator, he raked in big campaign bucks and
produced legislation like the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which
deregulated financial derivatives and relaxed oversight of commodity exchanges.

  One of the worst perpetrators is Arthur Andersen, which not only was asleep
at the switch but shredded Enron documents. Andersen was Enron's auditor and
consultant to the company, a sweetheart deal arrangement that would never have
been if former Securities and Exchange Chairman Arthur Levitt had had his way. 
  Mr. Levitt, who says there are a ""multitude of villains"" -- rating agencies,
investment bankers, company and board officials as well as accountants -- sees
a clear conflict of interest: ""When a firm is paid a million dollars a week,
half of which comes from consulting, when it comes down to making a subjective
judgement -- and there were probably hundreds of subjective judgements in an
Enron audit -- it's obvious who they're going to side with, management or
shareholders."" 
  But when Mr. Levitt tried to end such conflicts, accounting firms, armed with
$24 million in campaign contributions the past two elections, persuaded
Congress to threaten the SEC budget and make him retreat. One lawmaker who
sided with the accountants was Sen. Lieberman. 
  Mr. Levitt is right, there are numerous private sector culprits; this should
lead to some serious reforms. But let's not let the politicians off the hook;
they're culpable too. 


Critics: SEC's Pitt Should Avoid Enron Probe
2002-01-16 23:00 (New York)

  By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Charles Gasparino and Susan Pulliam in
New York and Michael Schroeder in Washington 

  As Enron Corp. was imploding in December, Harvey Pitt, the new head of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, called a private meeting of the accounting
industry's top officials. The industry, already under pressure, was facing
questions about why Arthur Andersen LLP failed to detect financial woes at the
energy trader. 
  But Mr. Pitt didn't call for sweeping changes. Rather, people briefed on the
meeting say that the SEC chief -- after years as a private attorney
representing securities and accounting firms -- offered the accounting
officials some advice: Come up with a statement addressing growing concerns
about the industry's ability to audit large corporate clients. 
  What resulted surprised even some current and former SEC officials. The
statement from the Big Five and their trade group, the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, blamed the accounting system, not the accountants
themselves, for failing to require corporate clients to disclose financial data
that could have prevented the Enron debacle. Mr. Pitt immediately posted the
guidelines, including the group's proposal to ""encourage public companies to
take immediate steps to improve their disclosures"" on the SEC's Web site. 
  The Big Five declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Pitt says his
meetings with the industry are ""old news,"" adding that AICPA's petition was
posted on the Web site as a result of a new policy of Mr. Pitt's. ""If it's a
rule-making the commission may act on, it's better to seek public comment
sooner rather than later,"" the spokeswoman said. 
  Today, Mr. Pitt will say that the SEC and accounting firms are creating a new
private-sector oversight board to monitor that industry. 
  Still, some investors' lawyers are critical. ""As a private attorney, Mr. Pitt
earned millions of dollars representing big Wall Street and accounting firms,
including Arthur Andersen,"" says Jacob Zamansky, a New York-based lawyer
representing investors. ""As SEC chairman he appears to be siding with the
industry rather than the public investors whom he is charged to protect."" 
  In any event, Mr. Pitt's ties to the financial industry put him in an awkward
position amid a major investigation by his agency into what went wrong at
Enron, and what role Arthur Andersen played in any misrepresentations Enron
made to investors. The big question: How well can Mr. Pitt, who represented
Andersen, as well as all the nation's big accounting firms, oversee a massive
inquiry into the largest accounting scandal in the nation's history? 
  Some critics say he shouldn't even try. Some legislators are calling for his
recusal from the Enron investigation, and the SEC inquiry into whether Arthur
Anderson violated securities laws by failing to uncover the company's
deteriorating financial statements. An even bigger challenge is whether Mr.
Pitt will be able to oversee what is sure to become a broader examination by
the SEC into the accounting system. 
  ""He ought to follow the [Attorney General John] Ashcroft model and recuse
himself,"" says Sen. Jon Corzine, former chief executive at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. The Democrat from New Jersey adds, ""There is a serious appearance issue
here based on his previous activities and representations in the legal
community."" Yesterday, Common Cause, a good-government organization, made a
similar recusal request. 
  Mr. Pitt says he has no intention to step aside from the Enron matter. ""Talk
about recusals misperceives how this agency operates,"" he said in a statement
this week. ""It is not the function of the chairman of the SEC, or any
commissioner, to manage an investigation. If and when I am asked to do anything
on this matter, I will follow both the letter and the spirit of the ethical
requirements of this office. Any suggestion that I would do otherwise is an
attempt to politicize the workings of an independent agency."" 
  Yesterday, a spokesman for Mr. Pitt said: ""Apart from joining the unanimous
vote to authorize the SEC division of enforcement to commence an investigation,
Chairman Pitt has not participated in the Enron investigation."" In an interview
yesterday, Mr. Pitt added: ""I'm interested in making certain that Enron doesn't
happen again."" 
  The administration backs Mr. Pitt. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said
President Bush has ""full faith and confidence that Mr. Pitt, as well as all
members of his administration, will do the right things."" 
  Mr. Pitt isn't the first SEC chairman to face criticism over past ties to
industry, of course. His predecessor, Arthur Levitt, initially sparked concern
by some who said he was too close to the securities industry. But Mr. Levitt
proved often to be tough on securities and accounting firms. 
  Questions about Mr. Pitt's potential conflicts of interest with major
financial companies and accounting firms are nothing new. Mr. Pitt, a former
general counsel for the SEC, went into private practice in 1978, and since
then, his client list included some of the biggest participants in the
financial industry, including Ivan Boesky during the insider-trading scandal
and Merrill Lynch & Co., after the Orange County, Calif., bankruptcy in 1994.
Mr. Pitt also was a top lawyer for the accounting industry. These potential
conflicts, raised during his confirmation hearings, weren't enough to derail
his appointment. 
  For years, Mr. Pitt has been involved in defending the accounting industry
against limits on consulting services being offered to audit clients -- a main
issue in the controversy over possible auditor-independence violations dogging
Arthur Andersen in the Enron debacle. In 1990, Mr. Pitt helped win SEC
clearance for Arthur Andersen to continue cross-selling consulting services to
audit clients. The argument was based on the fact that Andersen Consulting had
been separated from the accounting side of the business, removing many of the
potential conflicts. (The SEC a few years later revoked its permission, because
Andersen Consulting began providing more services to Andersen audit clients
than anticipated.) 
  In a recent interview, Mr. Pitt said he wouldn't take part in decisions by
the SEC related to his former law-firm clients for a year. Meanwhile, SEC
officials say he hasn't pulled any punches so far in the Enron investigation,
at least the part that involves potential misdeeds at the energy company and
its executives. ""Go get 'em,"" he told members of the enforcement staff when the
SEC launched its inquiry into Enron in October. 
  In the interview, Mr. Pitt says he has ""focused on the real issues -- a
disclosure system that is outmoded and is incomprehensible."" He adds: ""The old
system was driven by a system of disclosure to avoid liability rather than to
inform investors."" 
  Mr. Pitt represented AICPA, the industry's trade group, back in 1997 after
the SEC, under Mr. Levitt, announced a new regulatory board to set standards
for auditor independence. The panel, the Independence Standards Board, was
charged with issuing rules to keep public accounting firms from doing work that
could affect the quality and independence of their audits of companies'
financial statements. The move partly reflected the SEC's view that AICPA
wasn't preventing potential conflicts between the auditing and consulting sides
of the industry. 
  AICPA hired Mr. Pitt to submit a long proposal on how the new board should
govern firm's independence issues. In a ""white paper"" dated Oct. 20, 1997, Mr.
Pitt was listed as the primary author of the study, which attempted to
undermine the idea that independence restrictions were needed at all. Mr. Pitt
argued that the regulatory emphasis was ""misplaced,"" and that there was no
cause for additional rules, much less an independent body to oversee the
accounting industry. The document also criticized the SEC, calling the move
""micro-regulation,"" and arguing that the industry should regulate itself. 
  And in a Oct. 22 speech before the accounting-industry trade group, Mr. Pitt
told the audience that the SEC has not ""always been a kinder and gentler place
for accountants"" and that under his watch, he will work to foster a ""continuing
dialogue and partnership, with the accounting profession, and we will do
everything in our power to evidence a new era of respect and cooperation. Of
course, there is a catch -- we expect the same from you!""



SEC Chief Pitt Has Hands Full With Enron, Critics, Papers Say
2002-01-17 07:12 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) -- SEC chairman Harvey Pitt
is talking about new accounting standards following the Enron
Corp. bankruptcy, although critics say his potential conflicts of
interest seem troubling, the Wall Street Journal and New York
Times reported.
     Some lawmakers say Pitt should remove himself from any Enron
inquiry because of his history as a lawyer representing large
accounting firms, including Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's outside
auditor, the Journal said, citing Democratic Senator Jon Corzine.
     In a meeting in December with accounting industry officials
over the Enron mess, he urged them to issue a statement that was
critical of the accounting system, and not the industry, the
Journal says.
     The agency's board currently has three of the five
commission slots unfilled and the Republican in the fifth slot has
announced her intention to leave soon, the Times said.
Replacements could come from the accounting industry, and that
could hinder reform, it said.


UPDATE: Bush Adviser Watched Enron's Woes Spread
2002-01-16 22:17 (New York)

  By Jeanne Cummings and Jim VandeHei 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

  WASHINGTON -- President Bush's top economic advisers monitored Enron Corp.'s
collapse last fall and its impact on the economy and natural-gas markets, but
never shared their findings with the president, the White House said. 
  Lawrence Lindsey, head of the White House's National Economic Council and a
former consultant to Enron until 2000, and Council of Economic Advisers
Chairman Glenn Hubbard conducted the review without contacting the
energy-trading company directly, Mr. Lindsey and White House officials said. 
  The monitoring began in mid-October, when Enron posted a huge third-quarter
loss. Beyond the energy sector, the economic experts focused attention on
currency markets, equity markets, bond markets and other financial indicators
looking for signs that investors were pulling out significant amounts of money,
which could lead to more-widespread problems. 
  Mr. Lindsey said in an interview that he and other senior administration
officials were concerned that Enron's troubles could rattle the markets ""to the
point that they would become dysfunctional, and might have an effect on the
broader economy."" He didn't inform the president because the markets ""resumed
function rather quickly,"" and ""other players"" came into the natural-gas and
energy markets to pick up the slack. 
  ""The system worked,"" Mr. Lindsey said. 
  Last fall, Enron's financial troubles were discussed on several occasions by
the White House economic team during weekly meetings. That group includes Mr.
Lindsey, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans,
both of whom received appeals for help from Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay in late
October. Mr. Evans and Mr. O'Neill decided it wasn't appropriate for them to
take action. 
  After a second call from Mr. Lay, Mr. O'Neill instructed Treasury
Undersecretary Peter Fisher to analyze what Enron's collapse would mean for the
energy sector and the markets, and whether the government should consider a
bailout. Mr. Fisher concluded it shouldn't. 
  White House press officials said Mr. Lindsey's staff coordinated their review
with Mr. Fisher and Energy Department officials. 
  Meanwhile, Rep. Henry Waxman, a senior Democrat on the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, sent a new letter to Vice President Dick Cheney in which
the California lawmaker renewed his request for more details about six meetings
Mr. Cheney and his staff held with Enron officials last year. Four of those
meetings took place during the period when Mr. Cheney was overseeing the
drafting of the administration's national energy policy. 
  In a 34-page study he released yesterday, Mr. Waxman argues that Enron held
undue sway in that process and managed to insert a disproportionate number of
the company's priorities into the administration's plan. But outside energy
experts say the White House report is largely a rhetorical document that
includes recommendations long sought by dozens of energy interest groups.


Former Lieberman Aide Worked for Enron as Lobbyist, AP Says
2002-01-17 07:50 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Corp.
lobbyist Michael Lewan, who was U.S. Senator Joseph Lieberman's
chief of staff from 1989-92, met three times in June and July with
the senator's staff as a lobbyist, the Associated Press reported.
     The former top aide of the Connecticut Democrat tried
unsuccessfully to set up meetings with Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay,
AP said. Lieberman, the 2000 Democratic vice presidential
candidate, is investigating the collapse of the failed energy
company. Lewan said he worked as an Enron lobbyist from June
through November, earning some $40,000, AP said.
     While Lieberman spokesman Dan Gerstein confirmed the
contacts, he insisted they wouldn't affect the investigation, AP
said. While Lieberman was aware Enron was Lewan's client, they
didn't talk about the company, Gerstein told AP.
     Lewan said he wasn't hired to lobby Lieberman and wouldn't
want to be a political burden to his personal friend, AP said.
Lieberman's Senate Governmental Affairs Committee is to begin
hearings Wednesday on Enron, AP said.

US Govt Agencies To Study Retirement-Plan Security
2002-01-16 20:58 (New York)

  By Kathy Chen 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

  WASHINGTON -- Administration officials appear to favor taking limited steps
to improve the security of retirement savings following the Enron Corp.
debacle, but haven't ruled out stronger measures. 
  Ann Combs, assistant secretary for the Labor Department's Pension and Welfare
Benefits Administration, said it is too early to say what specific
recommendations will be issued by a presidential task force that includes the
Labor Department. But she said her agency is ""very strongly in favor"" of
improving access to investment advice and that ""we don't want to go overboard""
on regulating retirement funds. Current regulations restrict employers and
investment companies that they retain from providing investment advice to
employees. 
  President Bush directed the Labor, Treasury and Commerce departments to set
up a task force last week, after the Enron bankruptcy wiped out the retirement
nest eggs of thousands of Enron employees, whose 401(k) plans were heavily
invested in Enron stock. 
  Ms. Combs said the task force is taking a two-pronged approach to examine
ways to strengthen retirement security. First, it is looking for potential
problems with employers' restrictions on portfolio diversification and
employees selling their company's stock. Regulators are also looking at whether
employees are getting adequate investment advice and whether the government has
sufficient enforcement tools to protect workers' pensions. 
  The agencies also plan to look at the broader issue of whether existing
pension-plan rules, passed in 1974, are outdated, Ms. Combs said. In recent
years, growing numbers of employees have shifted from traditional pension plans
to defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. ""We need to make sure laws are
adequate to protect people under both,"" Ms. Combs said. 
  Ms. Combs said the White House hasn't taken a formal stand on existing
legislation, including a bill introduced by Sens. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.)
and Jon Corzine (D., N.J.) to restrict the amount of company stock in 401(k)
plans and allow workers to freely sell their company stock. 
  While the task force will look at whether employers should be able to
prohibit workers from selling their company stocks and whether plans could
include company stocks, ""we need to work closely with Congress to strike the
right balance,"" Ms. Combs said. Employers aren't required to offer 401(k) plans
or to make matching contributions, she said, ""so we don't want to go
overboard."" She also questioned how to administer any proposed limits on the
amount of company stocks in 401(k) plans. 
  Karen Friedman, director of policy at the Pension Rights Center, a consumer
advocacy group in Washington, said, ""financial education is one step, but
that's not going to solve the problem. You need stronger laws on the books to
protect workers."" She said measures are needed to limit how much employee
contributions could go to their company stocks and to allow employees to move
investments out of their company stocks. 
  The task force hasn't set a deadline for issuing policy recommendations but
wants to move ""very expeditiously,"" Ms. Combs said. The three departments'
secretaries met for the first time last week, and another meeting is set for
today. 


Enron Europe's Eric Shaw Comments on Collapse, Implications
2002-01-17 03:43 (New York)

     Berlin, Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by
Eric Shaw, vice president of Enron Europe, on the collapse of
Enron Corp. and its implications for the European power-trading
market. Shaw made the comments at an energy conference in Berlin:

On the current situation:
     ``The current situation of Enron Europe is that we're under
administration under U.K. law. We're being run by the
administrators of PriceWaterhouseCoopers and a small group of
employees has been retained to help the administrators maximize
the value of the stake for the creditors. That's mostly involved
the liquidation processes, unwinding our trading positions, the
sales of various parts of our businesses. You'll see small bits
and pieces of what we've had before being distributed among the
industry. Most of the activity will be done in the next months but
it could stretch out for a long time.''

On Enron's collapse:
     ``It was very simple why Enron has collapsed. A large and
sophisticated trading operation depends almost exclusively on
confidence associated with that trading operation of both the
counterparties in that operation and the sources that finance it.
Through a confluence of events in the second half of last year we
suffered a dramatic loss of confidence. At the end we ended up
with few counterparties and almost no finance. Once you've lost
those two things it's very clear that the end is near and it was
surprising how quickly the end came.''
     ``Why did confidence evaporate? There was a complete lack of
trust in what Enron was saying and the numbers it put out to the
community. I honestly don't know why that happened but I'm
confident that the truth will come out.''

On Enron Europe:
     ``The core energy trading business was sound. We had a
profitable and healthy business in power and gas and was highly
successful in gaining both market share and opening up markets
across Europe. There was no giant black hole in the trading
operations.''

On affect on trading in Europe:
     ``Low and behold we had some drama. We had some terrible
spikes in power prices in December. It was the collapse of Enron.
A large part of the wholesale trading market in gas and power
disappeared overnight. Liquidity disappeared and has reduced
dramatically. That resulted in the fact that exogenous shocks had
an amplifying effect on prices. We've had a very cold weather down
south, which led to some big spikes because there wasn't enough
liquidity to absorb those spikes in the market. The evidence is
that liquidity is coming back to the market. As people have come
back from their Christmas holidays power prices started coming
down and that effect was seen across Europe. The same in the gas
markets.''

On credit ratings, the future:
     ``It'll be a tremendous focus on credit ratings. Where as
before the old world almost had a threshold above which you didn't
really have to worry about investment and credit ratings. Just
having that is clearly not sufficient. If you want to participate
in this market you have to make sure your organization has not
only a very solid credit rating but also a fair degree of
confidence behind its physical ability to deliver what it's
contracted to deliver and general confidence in the business
principles.
      ``Some say this is a clear example of why these types of
market participants shouldn't be in because they disappear over
night. I tend to agree with that. Clearly customers and
participants need to be critically focused and ask if a company
delivers what it's contracted to deliver and does it have the
financial resources to make good on the damages it may cause. But
I think those who say this kind of liberalization experiment
didn't work are dead wrong. The more liberalized a market is, the
more it can cope with an exuberant shock like this.''

On opportunities:
     ``For the exchanges, there should be a huge opportunity
especially to the extend that the exchanges will develop
mechanisms to take care of the credit problem. The industry must
push hard to get those structures in place. Enron in the past may
have not been as big a proponent of that as others. The
consolidation of exchanges, the implementation of a clear, good
and strong processes of these over-the-counter and futures
transactions will help a lot of people confidence back in this
market.

On lessons learned:
     ``For the European market the lessons to be learned will be
the lessons about pride and humans. For the gas and power markets
we can sum them up by (philosopher Friedrich) Nietzsche: `Whatever
does not kill me will make me stronger.'
     ``Employees in the U.S., especially those close to retirement
age, suffered most from having their pension and retirement funds
tied to the stock. Reform is necessary there.''


IntercontinentalExchange Gaining From Enron's Collapse, FT Says
2002-01-17 00:14 (New York)

     Singapore, Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Trading volume on
IntercontinentalExchange, an online commodity bourse, has risen 30
percent this month from December levels after the collapse of U.S.
energy trading firm Enron Corp., the Financial Times reported,
citing Chuck Vice, IntercontinentalExchange's chief executive.
     Vice attributed the increase to users seeking to ``minimize
exposure to any one firm by broadly distributing business across a
large and diverse group of counterparties,'' the FT said.
     IntercontinentalExchange plans to begin clearing services
next month to protect users from the risk of default by
counterparties they deal with through the service, the report
cited Vice as saying.
     Earlier this month, IntercontinentalExchange said the number
of participating firms and users on its service in 2001 increased
by more than 400 percent against 2000. The online trading service
recorded natural gas trading volume of 500 billion cubic feet on
Dec. 27, breaking the previous daily record set on Dec. 4 by 18
percent.

AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER BUYS ENRON NORDIC ENERGY
2002-01-17 09:33 (New York)

     (The following is a reformatted version of a press
release issued by AEP Energy Services Ltd. and received
via electronic mail. The release was confirmed by the
sender.)

     AEP EXPANDS EUROPEAN POWER CAPABILITIES WITH
ACQUISITION OF ENRON NORDIC ENERGY

     Columbus, Ohio, Jan. 17 -- AEP Energy Services Ltd.,
the London-based European wholesale energy marketing and
trading subsidiary of American Electric Power (NYSE:
AEP), has acquired Enron Nordic Energy.

     The Oslo based power marketing and trading
organization provides AEP Energy Services' European
wholesale group with an established capability for power
and weather trading, origination and portfolio management
in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Germany. The team
is headed by Thor Lien and is a substantial participant
in North-Western European markets, representing around
20% of trading volume, making it the largest trader in
the Nordic region.

     ""The addition of Thor and his team provides us with
a sub platform in the Nordic region, first-rate expertise
power and associated interconnector access via Sweden and
Denmark. Today's deal pertains to people and their
expertise instead of a major capital expenditure for
assets, and represents another major milestone in our
growth."" said Hank Jones, senior vice president with AEP
Energy Services and head of AEP's wholesale business in
Europe.

     AEP Energy Services are continuing to aggressively
build their wholesale energy capabilities in the United
Kingdom and Europe, using the very successful U.S.
wholesale structure as a model. AEP Energy Services
recently announced the purchase of 22 members of the
Enron International Coal team and selected contracts.

     American Electric Power's growth strategy focuses on
key aspects of the wholesale fuel and power generation
value chain -- generation and related energy assets,
wholesale marketing and trading of energy commodities,
fuel procurement and transportation and related
activities. AEP Energy Services' London office markets
and trades power, natural gas and coal in the UK and
Europe.

NEW YORK - U.S. Congressional probes into the relationship between Enron and its auditor will examine the role of two of the collapsed energy traders' most senior executives who previously worked for Andersen. 
Richard Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, and Jeffrey McMahon, chief financial officer, both held positions in the Houston office of Andersen. Both men are expected to be interviewed by Congressional investigators in the next few weeks.
Andersen's Houston office was responsible for the audits of Enron, which collapsed last month in the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
The relationship between client and auditor is under intense scrutiny by Congress and regulators, which could press criminal and civil charges over the affair. 
Enron said that neither executive would comment, adding that it was standard for companies to recruit employees from their auditors. 
People close to some of the Congressional investigations expressed concern, however. ""Given the array of things that have happened, it's cause for heightened scrutiny,"" said one. 
Andersen faces questions over the objectivity of its work for Enron after it emerged that it earned US$25-million for its audit last year and US$27-million for other services. The Enron audit was one of its most lucrative worldwide. 
Mr Causey, as a senior manager at Andersen, had primary responsibility for the Enron engagement. 
As chief accounting officer at Enron, he is likely to face questions over why the company once rejected amendments to the accounts proposed by the auditor. It later made the changes in restatements. 
Mr McMahon took over as Enron's chief financial officer after the sudden departure of Andrew Fastow in October. 
Mr Fastow left after it emerged that the energy trader had suffered huge losses in dealings with off-balance sheet partnerships that he once headed. 
The consequent restatement of several years' accounts all audited by Andersen sparked a loss of investor confidence in Enron and the company's plunge into bankruptcy. 
Mr McMahon began his career at Andersen in Houston, where he was audit manager in the company's energy division. 
Before joining Enron, he was chief financial officer at MG Natural Gas, part of Metallgesellschaft. 
He left in 1994, the year the German group almost collapsed after running up big losses in oil futures trading in the US.

The Enron Post-Mortem

c. 2002 New York Times Company

The most spectacular corporate demise ever cannot remain a befuddling mystery. In order to restore confidence in American capitalism and in the integrity of its financial markets, the public needs to understand what brought Enron down so suddenly last year. How could the Houston-based energy company, ranked seventh on the Fortune 500 list of America's largest companies, and often touted as one of its most innovative, fail so unexpectedly, wiping out $60 billion in shareholder value? 
Congress is appropriately holding a number of hearings to seek answers to that question. Enron's financial bankruptcy, triggered in part by revelations of faulty financial reporting, was a shocking national calamity. Its post-mortem, which will take the form of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and private lawsuits as well as the Congressional hearings, is likely to reveal serious deficiencies in how the public interest is protected on an array of regulatory fronts. It may lead to new federal regulations of pension plans, accounting procedures and energy markets.
On Capitol Hill, calls for an inquiry have come from both sides of the aisle, though Democrats clearly have an added incentive to pursue the matter. No company has more generously backed President Bush throughout his political career than Enron. Its chairman, Kenneth Lay, was among the influential advisers to Vice President Dick Cheney's secretive energy task force last spring. Even before Enron's implosion, the General Accounting Office, acting at the behest of some Democratic legislators, sought documents from Mr. Cheney about the task force's meetings and its participants' agenda. The vice president's office was uncooperative. 
At his Crawford ranch on Monday President Bush supported Congress's right to look into Enron's collapse. To address concerns about Enron's ability to take regulatory shortcuts because of its political influence, Mr. Bush should direct everyone in his employ, including the vice president, to be forthcoming with Congress about any dealings they had with the energy company. 
Democrats, for their part, should resist the temptation to use the Enron saga for cheap political gain. Talk of a ''cancer on the presidency'' and of a ''Bush Whitewater'' is unwarranted at this point, and threatens to trivialize and unduly politicize an inquiry vital to the health of the American economy. 
It was before President Bush ever took office that Congress granted Enron exemptions for much of its complex trading activity, in everything from energy futures to broadband capacity, from oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and other regulators. Senator Joseph Lieberman's hearings later this month will rightly explore whether such oversight could have prevented Enron's deceptive transactions with mysterious off-balance-sheet partnerships run by its own officers. 
The fate of Enron employees' retirement accounts provides a second broad subject of inquiry. Criminal charges may still be in store for top Enron executives, who sold nearly $1 billion worth of their company stock, possibly knowing it was improperly inflated, before it plummeted. Thousands of employees were not so lucky, and lost their lifetime savings. Close to 60 percent of all employee 401(k) money was tied up in Enron stock. Congress should consider a proposal by Senator Jon Corzine to cap the percentage of employees' retirement accounts that can be held in company stock. 
The third issue that Congress and the S.E.C. need to address is the lack of public confidence in financial reporting. Beyond Enron's questionable behavior, the most alarming failure of all may have been that of its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, to flag the company's dubious accounting practices. 
Enron is only the latest and most dramatic instance of an accounting firm's failing to protect the public from largely fictional financial reporting by a major company. The accounting industry insists it can regulate itself, but the evidence points to the contrary. Firms have placed themselves in an untenable conflict of interest by providing the same companies they audit on behalf of the public with an array of consulting services. Congress ought to pass legislation to bar such conflicts. 
Unsuspecting Enron employees were the most direct victims of the company's lack of forthrightness, but overall investor confidence in the integrity of the marketplace took a serious hit with Enron's demise. There are plenty of reasons for Congress to try to find out why it happened and how it can be prevented from ever happening again.

Federal Judge Postpones Enron Contract Hearing To Jan. 15

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

(This report was originally published late Thursday.)
NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--A federal bankruptcy judge delayed by two weeks a hearing to decide whether Enron Corp. (ENE) must accept or reject natural gas-delivery contracts with two California public utilities. 
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, during a conference call late Thursday with Enron and some of the company's creditors, rescheduled the hearing for Jan. 15. The hearing had been set for Thursday. 
The decision came after Melanie Gray, of Weil, Gotshal & Manges - which represents the beleaguered company - assured the judge on the call that Enron would continue providing natural gas and services to San Diego Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Gas Co. at 80% of levels prior to the Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing. 
This is the full extent of Enron's ability since seeking court protection a month ago, said Gray. 
San Diego Gas & Electric Company and SoCalGas - public utilities regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission - provide natural gas and transmission services to respective customers in San Diego and Southern California. 
Under a CPUC program allowing customers to select energy providers other than traditional utilities, Enron has serviced some of the utilities' customers. But since the bankruptcy filing, Enron hasn't been fully honoring its contracts, and the utilities have had to pick up the slack. 
In recent weeks, San Diego Gas and SoCalGas filed motions asking the bankruptcy court to force Enron to decide whether it wanted the contracts, and if so, to commit to fully honor them.

Sen. Levin says Enron ran `massive shell game,' opens probe
By H. JOSEF HEBERT

WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. Carl Levin says Enron Corp.'s business practices were like ""a massive shell game with multiple layers of conflict of interest"" and says he plans to subpoena company documents. 
The Michigan Democrat, chairman of the Governmental Affairs investigations subcommittee, said within weeks, it will subpoena documents from Enron's board, senior managers and auditing firm.
At the same time, the full Governmental Affairs Committee will hold a hearing Jan. 24 into why government regulators failed to see the ""red flags"" at Enron and protect investors and the company's employees who have lost hundreds of millions of dollars as Enron stock plummeted. 
Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2 as its stock fell from a high of $90 a share a year ago to less than $1. Thousands of Enron workers were prevented from selling Enron stock in their 401k retirement plan during the collapse. 
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., the full committee's chairman, promised Wednesday ""a search for the truth, not a witch hunt."" But he did not rule out an examination of Enron's relationships with the Bush administration. 
""We're going to go wherever the search takes us,"" Lieberman said at a news conference, noting Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay's involvement in crafting the administration's energy agenda last spring. ""We've got to ask whether the advice rendered (by Lay) was at all self serving."" 
Lay, a longtime friend of the president, was a prominent contributor and fund raiser for Bush's presidential campaign. Other Enron executives also gave significantly to Bush's campaign, according to the watchdog Center for Public Integrity. 
The Senate committee's initial focus will be on why the Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and other regulators did not foresee the problems and raise concern about Enron's business practices. 
""The untimely and wholly unexpected failure of a corporate giant like Enron is an alarm call to all of us in government,"" said Lieberman. He said it has sent shockwaves into the investment community and concern about energy industry deregulation. 
Levin's subcommittee planned to target Enron's board of directors and auditors to determine what they knew of Enron's sometimes secretive business dealings, including the use of questionable partnerships and what Levin called ""offshore entities."" 
Internal Enron documents reportedly show that top company officials were directly involved in the creation and oversight of the partnerships, and that they viewed them as crucial to company growth - even as they disguised an estimated $500 million in Enron debt not included on the company's books. 
The procedures set up by Enron required former chief executive and president Jeff Skilling and two other senior Enron officials to approve all transactions with the partnerships, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing the documents. 
Levin said he was dismayed about ""what appears to be a massive shell game with multiple layers of conflict of interest"" that contributed to Enron's collapse at a time when most investors believed the company to be thriving. 
Top Enron executives and directors ""apparently reaped almost $1 billion in stock sales in 2000 and 2001,"" said Levin, while hundreds of Enron workers were barred from selling Enron stock in their 401k retirement fund during the company's collapse. 
Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the subcommittee's ranking Republican, said in a statement that she wants to know whether Enron executives and board members, when selling their stock, ""knew of the company's impending financial situation."" 
Enron - once the seventh largest in the country in terms of revenue - filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2.

Petrobras mulls buying Enron assets in Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil

01/04/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

SAO PAULO (AFX) - Petroleo Brasileiro SA is studying the possibility of acquiring Enron Corp's assets in Bolivia and Argentina, as well as its stakes gas distributors in Brazil, financial O Estado de Sao Paulo reported, citing Antonio Luiz Menezes, head of Petrobras' gas and energy operations. 
In Bolivia, Enron jointly controls with Royal Dutch/Shell group Transredes, a company that operates gas pipelines 3,000 kilometre long and oil pipelines 2,500 kilometre long.
Enron also co-owns GTB, which manages the Bolivian segment of the Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline. Petrobras has a majority stake in TBG, the entity that manages the Brazilian segment of the pipeline. 
However, Shell opposes the move, as it fears it would give Petrobras too great a control over the Bolivian market, the report said, citing an unnamed source. 
Menezes is also quoted as saying that Petrobras is studying the possibility of buying Enron's Gaspart unit, which holds stakes in seven gas distribution companies in the south and northeast regions of Brazil. 
He also said that the company expects to close the purchase of Enron's stakes in gas distributors CEG and CEG Rio in the new few days.

Sale seen for Enron's metals trading business: Administrator expected to finalize sale by next week

LONDON - Administrators to Enron Corp. are close to the sale of the London-based metals trading business of the collapsed U.S. energy group. 
The deal, which would be the third significant disposal to be negotiated in Britain since Enron's European operations were put into administration at the end of November, could be announced within days, people close to the transaction said.
Potential buyers for all or parts of the business are Glencore, the Swiss commodities trader, Sempra Energy of San Diego, HSBC and Goldman Sachs. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is acting as administrator, is understood to have singled out one of the interested parties and is expected to finalize the sale by the weekend or early next week. A sale had been expected before Christmas, but was delayed because of difficulties in unravelling the group's complex corporate structure. 
Enron's metals business was bought 18 months ago from MG, the trader, for (ps)300-million ($689-million) as part of a diversification into trading products outside its core energy activities. But the business is now expected to fetch less than that price. 
The business has continued to operate independently of Enron on the London Metals Exchange since the parent company filed for bankruptcy protection last month. 
The deal is not expected to include Enron's international metals warehousing side, which was up for sale before Enron's collapse and will be sold separately, most likely to the same buyer, in the next few weeks. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers last month agreed to the (ps)96-million sale of Enron Direct, which supplies gas and power to 160,000 small British businesses, to Centrica. Enron's Europe-based international coal trading operations are also understood to have been sold to AEP, the large U.S. energy group, in a deal valued at up to US$35-million. 
Enron's remaining British assets include Wessex Water, the southwest England water supplier, and a 42% stake in Teesside Power. 
The sale of the Teesside stake is expected to take at least another month because of efforts to make the unit fully independent of Enron and ongoing negotiations with fellow stakeholders GPU of the United States and Northern Electric, controlled by Warren Buffett, the U.S. billionaire. 
Electricite de France, the French state-owned power group, has expressed an interest in buying Enron's European assets. 
At least four financial institutions Royal Bank of Scotland, Candover Investments, WestLB and Barclays Capital have also expressed interest in refinancing Wessex.

Report on Business: The Wall Street Journal
Power plant plans on hold

Energy companies are scaling back power plant construction to cope with low wholesale electricity prices and market jitters over high levels of corporate debt. 
New data show that some 18 per cent of all announced projects already are effectively dead, nearly double the attrition rate a year ago. That could spell trouble when the U.S. emerges from recession and electricity demand again picks up. New plants not only support economic growth, but replace older, dirtier plants as required under increasingly stringent air-quality standards.
Many energy companies have been on the defensive in the wake of Enron Corp.'s stunning collapse last month. A pioneer in deregulated energy markets, Enron came unglued as a result of loss of investor confidence in the honesty of its accounting. The company is now seeking to reorganize under Chapter 11 U.S. bankruptcy court protection. 
Since Enron's sudden fall, competitors like Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and El Paso Corp. have said they are scaling back new development projects and have begun to shed assets. Calpine Corp., which has the most aggressive development program among power plant builders, is expected to make a similar announcement later this month. 
Data compiled by Energy Insight, a research unit of McGraw Hill Co., show that 91,139 megawatts of generating plants, out of a total announced portfolio of 503,780 megawatts, had been cancelled or tabled by the end of 2001, amounting to 18 per cent of proposed new additions. A year earlier, 30,909 megawatts of capacity had been jettisoned, amounting to about 10 per cent of the announced total. 
Last month, was the first month in recent memory in which plant cancellations significantly exceeded additions, with a net 2,952 megawatts of capacity, equal to about six major power plants, being removed from the pipeline. 
The Energy Insight statistics are based on company announcements and, if anything, understate what's actually happening in the marketplace since companies often slow projects rather than kill them outright. In California, for instance, suppliers have five years to break ground, once permits are granted. New York sets no time limit. 
No one expected all the announced plants to get built, but a significant sustained retrenchment could create special problems. In most cases, plants planned for startup in 2002 and 2003, for which financing already has been obtained, are going forward. But projects with completion dates beyond 2004 increasingly are in doubt. 
""It's the later dates we're paying attention to,"" says Bob Therkelsen, deputy director of the California Energy Commission. ""There are huge uncertainties."" 
Only one major plant has been cancelled in New York, so far. California has lost four major plants and roughly two dozen small ""peaking plants"" that only would run during periods of especially high demand. Developers not going forward with projects in California include FPL Group Inc., Enron Corp., and El Paso Corp. Both states experienced energy shortages in 2000 and again last year when the economy remained robust. They are the most vulnerable when demand increases. 
Analysts expect cancellations to continue as companies trim debt and react to low wholesale power prices that partly reflect slack demand. Not only may needed capacity not get built, but there's no certainty that what does get built will be built in the best places.

Dynegy to Get Enron's Natural Gas Pipeline
AP

01/04/2002
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 4
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 3 -- Dynegy Inc. said tonight that it would acquire the valuable Northern Natural Gas pipeline from the Enron Corporation in a settlement of one dispute between the companies that had tried to merge last year. 
Dynegy had claimed Enron signed away its right to the 16,500-mile pipeline system, which extends from Texas into the Midwest, in exchange for $1.5 billion invested in Enron before a proposed combination of the companies, which are competitors in the energy business, collapsed in late November.
Enron claimed its smaller rival illegally terminated the $9 billion deal and therefore had no right to the pipeline. Enron had argued that Dynegy's claim should be part of Enron's federal bankruptcy proceedings in New York. 
Dynegy said in a statement tonight that the companies have agreed to close the pipeline deal by the end of the month. Enron, however, would have the option to repurchase the pipeline by June 30. 
Now that Dynegy appears to be acquiring the pipeline, it ''solves a chunk of their problems,'' James McAuliffe, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said tonight. 
He noted that Dynegy's credit rating had been lowered since its involvement with Enron. 
Dynegy said the settlement would not affect the companies' bigger battle over the failed merger agreement. The company said it would pursue its claims that Enron breached that agreement. 
Enron also announced the settlement tonight and said it would press a separate lawsuit seeking $10 billion in damages from Dynegy related to the collapse of the merger. It also said it was amending the damages lawsuit to include its complaint that Dynegy's exercise of the option on the pipeline was improper. 
Enron sought bankruptcy protection from its creditors after its swift downfall from a Wall Street darling because of questionable accounting practices that the Securities and Exchange Commission and others are investigating. 
Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2 as its stock fell from a high of $90 a share a year ago to less than $1. Dynegy is among creditors who plan to ask Federal Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez in New York to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston, where Enron and Dynegy are both based. 
Dynegy called off the deal to buy the company after Enron's financial problems were disclosed. 
Enron is to provide transition services related to the pipeline through the end of June. 
Chuck Watson, the chief executive of Dynegy, said the company was acquiring the pipeline under terms originally agreed upon by the companies, with the exception of an extension of Enron's option to repurchase the pipeline to the end of June from May 9. 
The original option agreement provided for the payment of $23 million at closing, subject to adjustments. 
In trading today, before the pipeline agreement was announced, shares of Enron rose 1 cent, to 64 cents on the New York Stock Exchange. They rose an another penny in after-hours trading. Shares of Dynegy were down 83 cents, to close at $25.28 in regular trading.

Dynegy settles lawsuit with Enron subsidiaries over pipeline
By KRISTEN HAYS

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Dynegy Inc. has settled a lawsuit with Enron Corp. subsidiaries and plans to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline that was part of a dispute between the two energy companies. 
Dynegy had claimed Enron signed away its right to the prized 16,500-mile pipeline system running between Texas and the Midwest in exchange for $1.5 billion invested in Enron before a proposed merger of the two competitors collapsed in late November.
Enron claimed its smaller rival illegally terminated the $8.4 billion deal and therefore had no right to the pipeline. Enron had argued that Dynegy's claim should be part of Enron's massive bankruptcy case filed in federal court in New York. 
Dynegy said in a news release late Thursday night that the companies have agreed to close the deal by the end of the month. Enron would have the option to repurchase the pipeline by June 30. 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Jim McAuliffe said late Thursday that Dynegy suffered for its efforts to save Enron, particularly when Moody's Investors Service downgraded its credit rating to one step above junk status. 
Dynegy reacted by unveiling a plan to strengthen its balance sheet by gaining cash from asset sales, reductions in capital spending and a stock offering. McAuliffe said the pipeline settlement adds another positive for Dynegy. 
""Now it looks like they're getting the pipeline,"" he said. ""That solves a chunk of their problems."" 
Dynegy said the settlement doesn't affect the companies' bigger battle over the failed merger agreement. The company said it would pursue its claims that Enron breached that agreement. 
Enron faces bankruptcy following the energy trader's swift downfall from a Wall Street darling to junk bond rated quagmire because of questionable accounting practices that the Securities and Exchange Commission and others are investigating. 
Enron filed for bankruptcy in New York Dec. 2 as its stock fell from a high of $90 a share a year ago to less than $1. Dynegy is among many creditors who will ask U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez in New York on Monday to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston, where Enron and Dynegy are based. 
Dynegy backed out of a deal to buy the company after Enron said it was in worse financial straits than it had originally disclosed. 
Enron is to provide transition services related to the pipeline through the end of the repurchase period in June. 
""We acquired the pipeline under the terms originally agreed upon by the two companies, with the exception of the date extension,"" said Chuck Watson, chairman and chief executive officer of Dynegy Inc."" 
Watson said Dynegy recognizes the value of Northern Natural Gas' operations and the way its employees serve customers. 
""We will be committed to maintaining the same high level of service and safe asset operation that has characterized Northern Natural Gas' management of its business."" 
The original option agreement calls for the payment of a $23 million exercise price at closing, subject to working capital adjustments. 
Northern Natural Gas provides transportation and storage services for its customers. It also provides transportation between other interstate and intrastate pipelines in the Permian, Anadarko, Hugoton and Midwest areas. 
""This action ensures continuity of quality service to the customers of Northern Natural Gas and stability for the outstanding employees who have run the pipeline carefully and safely over many years,"" said Stan Horton, chairman and chief executive officer of Enron Transportation Services Co. 
In trading Thursday, shares of Enron were up a penny to close at 64 cents in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They were up another penny in after-hours trading. Shares of Dynegy were down 83 cents, or 3.1 percent, to close at $25.28.

SEC Weighs Tougher Accountant Self-Policing Options, Pitt Says
2002-01-04 08:46 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 4 (Bloomberg) -- The Securities and Exchange
Commission is considering a plan for a self-policing authority to
punish accountants who fail to meet professional standards,
possibly by giving that power to an existing organization.
     ``We can improve what already exists,'' SEC Chairman Harvey
Pitt said in an interview. ``Our goal is to make sure that public
investors are fully protected.''
     Pitt, who has headed the SEC since August, has been under
pressure from Congress to improve accounting standards after Enron
Corp. filed for the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy ever last month.
Arthur Andersen LLP was Enron's accountant and is under SEC
investigation, along with Enron, for possible accounting and
disclosure fraud.
     The SEC will open talks soon with the largest U.S. accounting
firms on developing tougher self-regulation, a spokesman for Pitt
said. Pitt said he expects the firms to agree either to creation
of a new self-regulatory organization or modification of existing
organizations that would be overseen by the SEC.
     Either approach might lead to a group that would function as
a regulator of accounting standards like the National Association
of Securities Dealers does for brokers. Pitt said in a Dec. 21
interview that he has no preference now for one organizational
approach over another.
     The group or groups should provide ``comprehensive self-
regulation'' that covers discipline, ethics, audit standards and
performance, and training and education, he said.

                         Potential Pitfalls

     Pitt said he saw potential pitfalls in investing all those
responsibilities in a single group because the various duties
``may lead to a diffusion of focus and concentration.''
     Lynn Turner, former SEC chief accountant, said the SEC should
press for a new organization or expand the authority of the Public
Oversight Board, an independent body that monitors how firms audit
public companies.
     ``There has to be an approach that is independent of the
accounting profession, or I have my doubts anyone will ever come
to grips with the issue'' of enforcing accounting standards, said
Turner, now a Colorado State University accounting professor.
     Douglas Carmichael, an accounting professor at the City
University of New York's Baruch College, said Congress needs to
create a new self-regulatory group because the POB has been ``too
timid'' and ``carries old baggage.''
     ``You need a clean slate,'' said Carmichael. Creating a new
self-regulatory body would require congressional legislation.

                         Congressional Criticism

     Since the Enron collapse in November, Pitt, a Republican, has
faced criticism from members of Congress for an overly
conciliatory approach to the accounting industry. Pitt represented
the five largest U.S. accounting firms, including Arthur Andersen,
while in private law practice.
     Pitt's comments in the interview represented an
acknowledgement that the current accounting system could be
improved through tougher oversight and enforcement.
     Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and one of
Pitt's critics, has asked the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, to research the benefits of an
accounting self-policing unit.
     Pitt's Democratic predecessor, Arthur Levitt, pushed
unsuccessfully for the formation of an accountants' self-policing
unit. Levitt, faced with resistance from the large accounting
firms, settled for expanding the authority of the POB, which is
headed by former U.S. Comptroller General Charles Bowsher. The POB
monitors how firms audit public companies, while lacking the power
to issue subpoenas or punish wayward auditors.

                         Few Disciplinary Cases

     Currently, the SEC can fine accountants, and state
accountancy boards can strip accountants of their licenses.
Critics of the accounting industry say these provisions do not
adequately protect investors.
     The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, a
trade group that represents large accounting firms, has the
authority to discipline accountants though it can't impose fines
or disbar accountants. The AICPA took disciplinary action in fewer
than a fifth of the 280 cases in which the SEC punished an
accountant between 1990 and 2000, the Washington Post reported.
     The AICPA has said accountants do an adequate job of policing
themselves, though it is open to considering changes. Bowsher has
said the POB might be better able to prevent debacles like the
Enron collapse if it got new powers to police the industry.
     The largest firms said last month that, in light of Enron's
collapse, they would review the profession's self-regulatory
mechanism. The Big Five firms are Andersen,
PricewaterhouseCoopersLLP, Ernst & Young LLP, KPMG International,
and Deloitte & Touche LLP.
     Spokesmen for the AICPA, POB, and the five largest accounting
firms didn't respond to requests for comment.
     ``Firms now see the need for a self-regulatory organization
in light of the crisis of public confidence,'' said Robert
Willens, an accounting analyst at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
``The public perception would be better if the authority were
given to an independent organization.''
     In November, Houston-based Enron, once the largest energy
trader, said it overstated earnings by $586 million over four-and-
a-half years, a disclosure that led to a collapse in the company's
stock price and the largest U.S. bankruptcy filing.

INDIA PRESS: Dabhol Lenders Oppose Removal Of Components

01/03/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- The Indian lenders to the Dabhol Power Co. have opposed company management's removal of certain components of the plant by DPC without their knowledge, reports the Financial Express without quoting any sources. 
The newspaper says the Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB) sought an explanation about developments at the site from the DPC.
Acting on an anonymous letter sent to it, IDBI sought an explanation from DPC management, said the report. 
DPC Managing Director K. Wade Cline replied to IDBI clarifying the reasons behind the company's actions and cited security reasons for taking out some critical components from the plant for use in the future. 
The developments have led to a debate about whether company officials can remove equipment without prior written permission of the lenders, since the property is mortgaged to the lenders, says the report. 
The report didn't say whether Cline's explanation had been accepted by the Indian creditors. 
Enron holds a controlling 65% stake in Dabhol, while General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Corp. (X.BTL) own 10% each. India's Maharashtra State Electricity Board owns the remaining 15%. 
Enron wants to sell its stake due to a dispute with the electricity board, which is its sole buyer, and with the Indian federal government over payment guarantees. In August, the U.S. company said it was willing to sell its stake at cost. 
Analysts have said with Enron now planning to sell foreign assets under its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, bidders on those stakes may move more quickly to take advantage of a distressed sale. 
The $2.9 billion, 2,184-megawatt power project located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra is the single largest foreign investment in India to date.

Report on Business: Canadian
Enron Canada sees survival Lawyer says company is making debt payments, expects to avoid insolvency
LILY NGUYEN

CALGARY -- Enron Canada Corp., which was on the brink of being dragged down by the troubles of its U.S. parent, is making debt payments and now expects to avoid insolvency, its lawyer says. 
""Enron Canada has made its payment obligations and intends to continue making its payment obligations,"" Robert Anderson, a lawyer with Blake Cassels & Graydon of Calgary, said in an interview this week.
The Canadian energy trading unit of fallen Enron Corp. was placed on death watch by the industry last month after its parent and credit guarantor sought U.S. bankruptcy protection, triggering a clause that allowed Enron Canada clients to cancel their contracts. 
In a failed court bid last month, Calgary-based Enron Canada had sought an order holding clients to their contracts for 30 days, despite its guarantor's loss of investment-grade status. At the time, Mr. Anderson had argued that cancellation of the contracts -- and clients reneging on payment obligations -- would force the solvent company out of business. 
But in the recent interview, Mr. Anderson said enough clients have been making their debt payments that the company has in turn been able to meet its financial obligations, including payments due at the end of December. 
""The key factor was sufficient people that owed Enron Canada money paid,"" he said. 
He confirmed the company intends to make payments due tomorrow for the settlement of financial contracts, and on Jan. 25 for the settlement of gas delivery contracts. 
So is the company out of the woods? 
""The best I could say is Enron Canada is optimistic,"" he said. 
He added that whether the company will carry on new trading business in the long term is still in question. 
Two recent developments could help its cause of continuing as a going concern. One was Enron Canada affiliate Enron Canada Power Corp.'s sale of its power contract for the output of the Sundance B generating plant outside Edmonton. 
The contract was sold to a joint venture of AltaGas Services Inc. and TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. for $220-million last week. The other was a court victory over IMC Canada Ltd., an Enron client asking to be released from payment obligations of $2.3-million. IMC, which failed in its request, has not made its payments yet. 
But while both events could eventually inject more money into the Calgary trader's pockets, when and how much is still unclear. 
Meanwhile, the company has lost many of its largest customers in the fallout. 
Chris Dawson, a spokesman for Petro-Canada in Calgary, confirmed his company has cancelled its contracts with Enron Canada and does not anticipate entering into new ones at this time. 
Brian O'Leary, a lawyer with Burnet Duckworth & Palmer in Calgary, who represented 13 energy companies opposed to Enron Canada's court bid, said most of his clients have taken similar actions. 
""Most of my clients have terminated their contracts, and they're not entering new ones,"" he said. 
Attention is now focusing on U.S. bankruptcy court, which is overseeing an auction of Enron Corp.'s trading businesses next week. Observers said the Canadian trading unit could be picked up by a buyer with investment-grade status, potentially giving the Calgary unit a new backer for its business. 
Mr. Anderson said the auction could be an important factor to Enron Canada.

Enron's political troubles grow.

Energy Compass
(c) 2002 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved

Enron's ties to the White House aren't helping the former energy giant with any government investigations. Washington watchdog group Public Citizen has just accused it of providing Texas Republican Senator Phil Gramm with more than a quarter-of-a-million dollars in campaign contributions over eight years in exchange for Gramm's support for Enron-backed legislation to eliminate regulations on energy commodity trading. 
Public Citizen also alleges that Gramm's wife Wendy, former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), was given a seat on the Enron board in 1993, only weeks after she pushed through a regulatory exemption for certain Enron futures trading activities.
According to the group, ""the Gramms' close involvement with Enron's corporate and legislative activities, the Gramms' possible knowledge and/or connection to criminal misconduct relating to Enron's collapse, and the effects of Enron's layoffs and other economic impacts on Senator Gramm's constituents may have been the leading factor in Gramm's decision on Sep. 4 not to seek re-election to the Senate in 2002."" 
The financial side may be getting a bit dicier, even by Enron standards. A deal to sell its stake in a Puerto Rican liquefied natural gas import and power project with Mirant appears to be collapsing. 
In addition, completion of a debtor-in-possession financing package with JP Morgan Chase and Citicorp has been pushed back by a month. An Enron attorney says the delay is related to the amount of paperwork involved in the $1.5 billion funding arrangement, not to problems syndicating the loan. 
The bankrupt former natural gas and electricity trading giant is the subject of investigations by at least five US congressional committees, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the departments of Labor and Justice, numerous agencies in multiple US states, and a federal grand jury in Houston. A Senate government committee says it may also look at connections between Enron and the White House. Enron was a major backer of President George W. Bush's election campaign (EC Dec.7,p4).

Whether intentionally or not, it may be crunch time for the banks.

Whether intentionally or not, it may be crunch time for the banks 
THIS year offers a turning-point for Japan's troubled banks. Until now, rather than forcing banks to clean up bad debts of as much as Y150 trillion ($1.1 trillion), the government has favoured stop-gap measures that have propped up the banks' weakest borrowers when they should have gone under. Investors in bank shares despair that the banks' problems will ever be confronted; or that if they are, there will be no end to them.
Certainly, the news in November that the biggest banks would write down Y6 trillion of problem loans in the year to March 2002 - three times their original target, and almost double their combined operating profits - failed to persuade investors of the banks' resolve. The four biggest banking groups saw more than Y5 trillion wiped off their market capitalisation, a drop of roughly one-third, in the final six weeks of 2001. The Topix banking index is close to record lows. 
The long drawn-out bank crisis may be coming to a head, however. The government has for years insisted that the banking system is sound, but now it is badly worried. Unless it restores confidence by April, when it has promised to lift its blanket protection of all deposits, the government fears runs on banks that could trigger a fresh crisis. To calm such concerns, the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, said on December 27th that he may inject public funds to boost banks' capital bases. The Financial Services Agency (FSA) is also, belatedly, trying to weed out the weakest banks. Its re-examination of Ishikawa Bank, a regional bank which it had earlier found to have more liabilities than assets, led to the bank's collapse on December 28th. The FSA is conducting a ""special"" inspection into the banks' biggest problem borrowers, in hopes of improving inadequate provisioning. 
Indeed, officials seem quietly to be planning a ""controlled collapse"" of the banks' worst debtors, to start later this month. Just how many borrowers will be affected is unclear, but a handful of big construction companies, among others, are expected to go bust. The clean-up could also involve sorting out other big companies in dire financial straits (without officially bankrupting them): one example may be Daiei, the country's biggest supermarket chain, which has Y2.6 trillion in debts. In a bid to persuade investors, especially foreign ones, that it is serious about reform, the government wants most of this choreographed clean-up finished before deposit insurance is lifted in April. 
That will not be easy. A mere handful of big bankruptcies would probably be seen as little more than a token gesture of reform, given the numbers of walking dead in Japan. On the other hand, a ""controlled"" exercise could soon get out of hand. Dealing with Daiei will be particularly tricky. A huge employer, its collapse would have political implications. Daiei is these days considered a test of the government's appetite for painful change. 
In little over a year, Daiei has spent the best part of a Y500 billion credit line, yet it has been unable to stem falling sales. Sanwa Bank, one of the chain's four biggest creditors, is weighing several schemes, including one in which Daiei's main supermarket operation has its debts forgiven, allowing it to survive, but other parts of the group are sold or shut down. Sanwa is under pressure to act quickly, for its exposure to Daiei will double when it merges with Tokai Bank, another lender, in April. It also wants to act before too many jittery suppliers start refusing to do business with Daiei. One problem will be persuading Sumitomo Bank, a third big lender to Daiei with several other costly headaches (eg, two life insurers and a bunch of construction companies), to approve the plans. The alternative is a much uglier outcome for Daiei, and for the dozens of banks from which it has borrowed. 
With plenty of weak companies at risk, unforeseen corporate bankruptcies could upset the government's orderliness. The cost of credit has shot up in the wake of recent bankruptcies, putting the viability of many more companies in doubt. External events, too, could prove a trigger. Japan's giant trading houses, for example, worry about Indonesia defaulting on its debt to them, leading to casualties. And officials are concerned about banks' exposure to derivatives issued by Enron, America's spectacularly bust utility, which have yet to be fully assessed. 
All the while, regulators have to worry about Japan's own economy, and about the risk that prices of government bonds may fall, damaging banks' huge bond portfolios. This could happen if Japan's sovereign-debt rating falls another notch, which - given the country's worsening finances - could easily happen. Or a sharp fall in the yen (see next story) might conceivably lead to capital flight and rising bond yields. 
Then again, 2002 could turn out to be yet one more year of government irresolution, in which banks are propped up and not cleaned up. That would be the worst outcome of all.

Taking Stock of Enron's Collapse

If your family doctor missed a diagnosis as badly as Robert Scheer did in claiming that ""Enron Is a Cancer on the Presidency"" (Commentary, Jan. 2), you would file charges of incompetence with the medical licensing board. Scheer's unprincipled attack on President Bush is no more than an expression of his bias against deregulation of anything, in this case of the energy trading market. 
Scheer fails to prove how deregulation led to improper accounting and disclosure by Enron that, if proven, would violate other long-standing legal requirements. Neither does he prove how any acceptable scheme of regulation would have prevented the problems of which Enron is accused. To go from an unsubstantiated attack on deregulation to a personal attack on the president is ideologically motivated and irresponsible.
Gerald W. Palmer 
Los Angeles 
* 
Give me six years, $60 million and two independent prosecutors with the ridiculous powers given to Ken Starr and I'm sure I could find crimes that would make the Whitewater land deal look ridiculous. Republicans hounded Bill Clinton over $200,000 he supposedly made. The Bush-Enron crimes must be in the millions, if not the billions. Not to mention the thousands of families and stockholders they've ripped off. But Democrats don't wield the absolute power in Congress given to the Republicans in the '90s. What a shame. 
Jeff Jones 
Santa Clarita 
* 
Scheer's commentary, although timely and proper, was at the same time provocative and accusatory. Not what the country needs at this moment. However, the president could take a cue from his foreign policy and freeze the assets of Enron executives who profited from company bonuses and the sale of Enron stock. This action would no doubt find favor with Enron shareholders who lost their retirement investments through mismanagement and possible fraud by company executives. The government has an obligation to investigate Enron, and Bush should take the lead. 
John M. Gillis 
Manhattan Beach 
* 
There is no question but that those culpable in the Enron mess should be held accountable for their misdeeds. Tactics such as freezing employee 401(k) retirement accounts while certain Enron officers quickly opted out were unconscionable. We are told that many employees lost hundreds of millions of dollars during their financial lockout, and our sincere sympathies go out to them. However, if these lower-level people at Enron had been allowed to sell when they recognized the ship was sinking, would we be equally sympathetic to the unsuspecting outside investors who could be equally stricken?

Markets
The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week; Chocolate chip muffins -- but not for Enron; Homestore roaches; take two aspirin; or better yet, try plastic surgery.
George Mannes
Markets Editor

This being a short week, we at the research lab were a little worried that Wall Street might not be able to do Five Dumb Things in time for our deadline. 
Our fears were unwarranted.
Here goes: 
1. Have Your Chocolate Chips and Eat Them, Too 
For most investors, the best thing you can say about 2001 is that it was educational. Yes, we may have lost money in the tech stock giddiness, but we also learned valuable lessons about money -- lessons imprinted in our consciousness as vividly as the Depression left its mark on a previous generation. 
We've learned that you can't have unrealistic expectations. You can't have reward without risk. You can't get something for nothing. 
At least, that's what we thought. 
So there we were Wednesday morning, in line to get our tea and doughnuts from the coffee cart at the intersection of Wall and Nassau streets, mere steps from the New York Stock Exchange. The sidewalks teemed with people returning to their Financial District jobs for the first workday of the new year -- all no doubt fortified with hard-earned wisdom about how if something seems too good to be true, it is. 
Then the lady ahead of us asked the coffee guy, ""Do you have any low-fat double-chocolate chip muffins?"" 
Right. So much for Wall Street's new approach to accepting harsh truths. Draw your own conclusion if you must, but the FDT research lab interprets this as a sign that the market is still irrationally optimistic. 
2. Well, That'sReassuring! 
Speaking of New Year's, we all have our favorite resolutions. Stuff like, I will exercise more. I will make new friends. I will eat fewer double-chocolate chip muffins. 
As for the boys at the lab, our only resolution was to stop making fun of Enron. 
Um, well, we hope that you stick to your resolutions better than we did. 
Enron item o' the week: On Wednesday, the Andersenaccounting firm announced that its quality control system for accounting and auditing ""has been deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards."" 
That's a relief. About as comforting as it would be to learn that former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow got A's in business school. 
Andersen, you will recall, attested to the veracity of the now-suspect books of not only Enron, but also such other Fun With Numbers Hall of Shame inductees as Waste Management, Sunbeamand (as Washington Postreporter David Hilzenrath recently recounted) the Baptist Foundation of Arizona. 
Andersen's certificate of merit covering the year ended Aug. 31, 2001, comes with caveats, however. (Read them yourself at http://peerreview.aicpa.org/firmfile-- search for and select ""Andersen"" and click on ""Peer Review."") On some of Andersen's auditing jobs, for example, ""certain substantive auditing procedures performed were not adequately documented,"" according to Deloitte & Touche, which audited its fellow auditor. Furthermore, on two jobs, there was insufficient documentation to confirm that the auditing had, in fact, ""provided significant competent evidential matter"" -- whatever that is -- ""to afford a reasonable basis for an opinion."" 
But don't worry. Andersen says it has fixed these problems. Plus, say Deloitte and Andersen, these issues weren't significant. In other words, these are problems, but they're small. You may safely ignore them. 
Now, where have we heard that before? 
3. There's No Place Like Homestore 
If Andersen receives the blue ribbon in the accounts receivable-quality control department, the runner-up has to be Homestore.com, which until not so long ago investors pegged as one of the likely survivors of the dot-com bust. 
See, the company relied in part on advertising revenues, just like a lot of other struggling dot-coms. But what set it apart, said Homestore bulls, was the steady, predictable subscription revenue the company reaped. 
Except Homestore's advertising revenue may not have really been there in the first place, the company said Wednesday. More specifically, it appears that anywhere from 44% to 78% of advertising revenue for the first three quarters of the year vaporized in the glare of a recent audit's magnifying glass. 
Homestore, which hasn't traded since first disclosing accounting problems Dec. 21, warns of further possible restatements. 
You've no doubt heard of the cockroach theory of accounting problems: For every critter you can see, there are 10 more hiding in the cracks. 
Let's hope Homestore isn't that kind of house. 
4. Take Two Aspirin and Conference Call Me in the Morning 
There are companies that want huge audiences for their financial news. And then, apparently, there's Peregrine Systems. 
When the software company announced Wednesday, Jan. 2, that it would fall short of estimates for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31, the warning appeared at a time when investors were no doubt glued to their seats: 11:26 p.m. ET. 
We at the FDT research lab would have seen it immediately, but for one small detail: We were home in bed. 
A spokeswoman for the San Diego-based Peregrine says there was nothing sinister about the timing. ""It's a question of time zones. ... it just seemed easier to do it last night,"" she said Thursday, rather than hold it until, say, 5 a.m. West Coast time, an hour before the company's 6 a.m. (West Coast time) conference call. 
Whatever the reasons behind the scheduling, Peregrine's news did not pass unnoticed by investors: The company's shares dropped 36% Thursday. 
Not that Peregrine has asked, but here are two Public Relations 101 tips for the company: One, always think about your audience -- in this case, a few reporters, plus a few more investors, who happen to be based on the East Coast. And two, it's pointless to have a clean conscience if you act like you have a guilty one. 
5. ""I just want to say two words to you ... just two words. Are you listening? Plastic surgery."" 
Speaking of clean consciences, let's have a round of applause for the good doctors at the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, the organization that last Friday released ""10 Cosmetic Surgery Predictions for 2002."" 
Top prediction: ""In the aftermath of Sept. 11, Americans will continue to re-evaluate their priorities; some will focus on personal improvement and, perhaps for the first time, consider cosmetic surgery as an option."" 
As a result, the ASAPS is bullish on injectable wrinkle treatments, abdominal etching, buttock augmentation and -- the holy grail -- the rehabilitation of silicone gel as ""a safe and effective breast implant filling material."" 
Yeah. Sept. 11. Buttock augmentation. Silicon gel. I see the connection. 
So what's the Dumb Wall Street angle here? Why, it's the new FDT Plastic Surgery Portfolio, an investment approach guaranteed to be just as safe as that time you went long K-tel. 

Plastic Fantastic Portfolio 
Company Claim to Fame
Allergan Marketer of wrinkle-treatment drug Botox
Inamed Hopes to market Botox competitor
Elan Manufacturer of Myobloc, being tested as
Botox alternative
Plastic Surgery Owner operator of ""only national chain of
cosmetic surgery and cosmetic laser centers""; notes that ""the WTC
tragedy had a temporary effect on patient psyche and pre-empted our
television commercials for over one week in September.""
Of course, we're not actually suggesting you'd make money with this investment strategy. But like they say, wealth is only skin-deep.

Commentary JOHN BALZAR Looking for Mr. Goodheart in the Firehouse

""Has your taste in men changed?"" I was making the rounds at a party recently with my notebook at the ready. 
The woman understood my question. She had been reading these same accounts about how manly sex appeal is undergoing a reevaluation. She also had the forthrightness to say that what she sees in the media doesn't necessarily reflect what her heart tells her.
""No, not really,"" she replied. 
That's generally the response I'd been getting from women. I was beginning to wonder if trend spotters weren't reaching too far. Then this woman added, ""But my feelings have changed about my son. If he grew up wanting to be a fireman now, I'd feel differently."" 
When mothers start talking about new aspirations for their sons, it's a good sign that something is going on in the land. 
For one, I have my hopes. Maybe I will live to see the gentleman resurgent. By that I mean a man who stands out by his purpose and the manner in which he presents himself. The man who ignores the social advice to ""just be yourself"" and instead strives to be something a little better. 
It's not money but it is class that I'm talking about, and not even class so much as one's principles and bearing. Few things in our culture would cost so little and could get us so far, if only to break the monotony of the last 20 years or so. Right, dude? 
Today's trend spotters in New York, in Washington, in Singapore, in London, in Calgary--to name just a few--are generally discussing the ""new male"" in terms of appearance. Thus, the hairy-chested man is supposedly back. Slick is out. Women are said to be eyeing firehouses, not Wall Street. Well, considering the state of the economy and the gargantuan overtime paychecks of your average fireman, I wonder if we don't simply have a case of digging for gold in new locations. But I could be wrong, and these observations get us only so far anyway. 
As I see it, half of being a man is what you are born with. If you find yourself now possessing the ""in"" look, congratulations. 
But, fellows, before the rest of us rush out and get hair plugs for our chests, let's consider the other half of manliness, that part that we have some say in. Like the way we carry ourselves. And our objectives. 
I'll take a stab at encapsulating what's really occurring: The NYFD has gained respect over MBAs because firefighters displayed selflessness, duty and honor. In threatening times, these attributes no longer seem quaint but desirable. Some people run out of burning buildings, some run in. Thank heavens for the courageous. 
That's it. 
Whatever trend emerges, or fails to emerge, has roots there. And it's not strictly a matter of gender, either. Men change in tune with the tastes of women according to the ageless quest for approval, so this conversation is more accurately about cultural shifts. 
As it is, American life as reflected in athletics, commerce, politics and show business is far too coarse. The Darwinian, Reaganesque view that life is but brutal competition has exhausted us. Coldbloodedness, the sneer, vulgarity, disdain, the knife in the back, ostentation--attitude!--no longer define the novel, but the ordinary. To stand out in this crowd anymore requires one to achieve, truly, the monstrous. Think Enron. 
But just as people set trends, they become captive to them. So even though there is widespread dissatisfaction with the values in our culture, we have achieved only peripheral progress in the pursuit of alternatives. Perhaps firefighters and tragedy have opened our eyes to the possibility that a man just might be able to score a touchdown with humility. Imagine the shock of that. 
Beneath the superficial, these inquiries about manliness speak to our fundamental regard for each other. Decency, courtesy, kindness, honor may be the codes by which some Americans live, but they have not been the reigning imperatives of our pop culture. A man who finds a bag of money on the shoulder of a highway is still portrayed in headlines as strange, if not demented, for returning it. 
So, when I hear about the sex appeal of NYFD firefighters, I trust that we are not speaking of goofy hats, Brooklyn accents, bitter and sometimes bigoted union politics or tracking wet ashes into the living room. And it's probably not a matter of hairy chests, either. We are talking about what a mother wants for her son: a better heart and a bigger purpose in life.

the cowboy hat on!!
What a disgrace. And look how  immoral he is...getting
a ticket for
drunken driving 24 years  ago!!
  And....aren't you so excited? Jesse Jackson has a
new  child !! I sent
him $5.  I used to send him $50...but my electric  bill
was $2,345 last
month, and I was short of cash. That is not  bad,
though...Susan's bill
was $3000 because she has a TWO-bedroom  apartment. I
am hoping to meet
Jesse's new girl friend out here. I think  she is
living with his other
girl friend from 1996. (Or maybe it was the  1994
one.... I forgot.)
  I love California...everything is  so
""environmentally correct"" here.
And all our liberal friends are in  power now. I am
sure glad we
demonstrated against building all those power  plants 8
years ago...or
else this state would be polluted like Texas  and
Georgia.  My friends
and I are going out tomorrow to demonstrate  against
that nuclear power
plant they recently re-opened. We shut that  down in
1994, and I think
some Republican sons of b------ are re-opening  it.
Probably just to keep
the businesses going. GEEZ!!
   Well...don't call me on Mondays, Wednesdays, or
Fridays because those
are  the designated days with no electricity. Not on
Tuesdays or
Thursdays  either...because those are the designated
days with no water
or  phones.  Call me on Saturday between 3 and 4
PM....usually we  have
power then. I don't understand why states with lots of
power like  Texas
and Georgia don't try to help us out.
  We won't have to  worry much longer about pollution
because all the
businesses are shutting  down, and there is no jet fuel
for the
airlines.  And gas is $8.50 a  gallon...so no one can
afford to drive.
  I LOVE California !!  Thank God for the Democrats !!
Love... your  daughter,

More than one Enron official warned company about growing crisis
One staff lawyer grew so worried, he secretly hired an outside law firm to review the company's murky business partnerships. Another executive was reassigned after raising alarms.
By Jake Tapper, Salon.com
Jan. 18, 2002 | In recent weeks, Enron executives have insisted that their controversial -- and ultimately disastrous -- accounting strategies were legally vetted. But Salon has learned that a law firm hired secretly by one of Enron's own attorneys last year recommended that the huge energy trader stop setting up the financial instruments whose exposure later drove the company into bankruptcy. 
At the heart of the Enron scandal are a series of complex partnerships that Enron employed to keep billions of dollars of debt off its books -- thus boosting both its quarterly profits and its credit level. Enron executives participated in these partnerships, earning millions of dollars in management fees and raising major conflict-of-interest issues. 
Embattled Enron CEO Ken Lay has attempted to justify the partnerships by noting that Enron's own staff attorneys as well as those at Vinson & Elkins, its powerful outside law firm, signed off on them. Despite this legal advice, it was reported earlier this week that one Enron executive, Sherron S. Watkins, raised serious questions about the propriety of the partnerships in a memo sent to Lay in late August. Salon has now learned of two other major instances in which Enron executives were told by company colleagues that the partnerships were deeply troubling and possibly illegal. 
In one case, an Enron staff attorney took the extraordinarily unusual step of secretly retaining another outside law firm to evaluate the legality of the partnerships set up by then-chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
Last summer, before Enron was forced to reveal the actual state of its finances, Fastow moved to set up more of these partnerships. But Fastow's plan was blocked when an Enron attorney named Jordan Mintz took matters into his own hands. According to sources inside Enron, Mintz, who had just moved from the company's tax department to its finance department, was so concerned about the questionable nature of the partnerships -- and apparently so worried that Enron's attorneys were too close to the business schemes to judge them correctly -- that he sought a second legal opinion. 

Without the knowledge of his boss, Enron chief counsel James Derrick Jr., Mintz hired an outside firm far removed from Enron and its Houston-based firm, Vinson & Elkins, to take a fresh look at the questionable deals. After reviewing the partnerships, the respected New York firm hired by Mintz -- Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson -- recommended to him that Enron stop setting up the the shell partnerships. The New York firm's opinion prompted Mintz to write internal memos to company executives urging Enron to halt the practice -- which they apparently did. In October, Enron fired Fastow. Last month, he hired celebrated attorney David Boies, who represented Vice President Al Gore during his Florida recount battles. 
Contacted Wednesday night, Mintz declined to comment, citing attorney-client privilege. When asked about the Mintz retention of outside counsel, Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said ""this is the first I've heard of that"" and declined to comment further. A spokesman for Fried Frank did not return a call for comment. 
Without specifically confirming the Mintz episode, House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Ken Johnson said that worried Enron executives did go outside the company for legal advice: ""(This) happened in a couple instances. There was more than one person who was spooked by these partnerships."" 
It is unusual for a corporate lawyer to go behind the back of his boss, the chief counsel, and retain an outside firm to do work for a company. And it was against standard operating procedure at Enron, where chief counsel Derrick had to approve of any outside legal work. But Mintz apparently thought that Derrick, who had worked at Vinson & Elkins before joining Enron, was too much a part of the company's closed culture, in which dubious business practices had become the norm.
No less than 10 congressional committees are investigating the collapse of Enron, an energy trading company with close ties to politicians in general and the Bush administration in particular. On Wednesday the Senate Finance Committee joined the ranks of nine other House and Senate bodies -- as well as the Departments of Labor and Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service -- by announcing that it, too, would look into the largest bankruptcy in American history. 
On Wednesday, investigators with the House Energy & Commerce Committee interviewed David Duncan, the former Enron auditor with Arthur Andersen who had been fired the day before. 
One of the primary questions under investigation is why Fastow and other Enron executives were permitted to establish complex and secretive partnerships with odd, obscure names -- LJM1, LJM2, JEDI, Chewco, the Raptor entities, Osprey, Big Doe -- that allegedly reaped these partners windfall profits while hiding Enron debt. In November, Enron had to revise its finance statements for the past four and a half years, acknowledging that the company was $600 million in net income poorer than it had led the government and its investors to believe. The Houston company also had to acknowledge an additional $2.5 billion in debt -- much of which came from these murky ""partnerships."" Recent revelations tied to the Watkins memo may result in billions more debt added to the Enron ledger. 
""Someone should have stepped up and said, 'No, you can't do these sort of things!'"" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. But for too long no one did, the employee added. And then when someone finally spoke up, it was too late. 
Currently, much is being made in the media of Watkins' August letter to CEO Kenneth Lay, released on Tuesday by investigators with the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals,"" Watkins wrote. ""The business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax."" 
But Watkins' letter, said one source, was not the only alarm being sounded within the company before it imploded. In addition to the flags raised by Watkins and Mintz, then-treasurer Jeff McMahon also aired his own growing concern. In her memo, Watkins alluded to McMahon's tribulation, writing that he ""was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of [the] LJM [partnership]. He complained mightily to [chief executive] Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later, Skilling offered him the CEO spot at Enron Industrial Markets and never addressed the five steps with him."" 
In the eyes of many Enron executives at the time, McMahon's new assignment was meant to silence him. McMahon ""learned about these partnerships and he thought they were wrong,"" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. ""He thought they were a huge conflict of interest."" McMahon, according to this source, went to Skilling and said, ""'We have this problem, and I think there's a conflict.' Skilling says, 'I'll take a look at it; I'll take care of it.' And the next thing you know, he's reassigned. And it was not a promotion."" To other executives it looked like retaliation against a whistleblower, an Enron source said. 
McMahon ""did go to Jeff Skilling and tell him he was uncomfortable with the internal and external conflicts the LJM partnerships were creating,"" confirmed Enron spokesman Palmer. ""And he told him he could no longer serve as treasurer with those conflincts in place."" As for whether the reassignment was a demotion of any sort, Palmer said, ""It's probably open to interpretation by a lot of people."" 
In August, the same month Watkins wrote her memo, Skilling himself resigned from Enron under mysterious circumstances. McMahon, who replaced Fastow as Enron's chief financial officer in October, did not return a call for comment. 
""We hope in the very near future to be interviewing Mr. McMahon,"" House Energy & Commerce Committee spokesman Johnson said. ""We feel he has a lot to offer."" Johnson's committee has uncovered a number of incriminating details in the Enron investigation, including the shredding of documents and the Watkins memo. 
A congressional source also reports that such matters may be just the tip of the iceberg, that much more damaging information will be coming out in the next few weeks dealing with the Enron partnerships.

If Enron isn't a political scandal, nothing is
So what if Bush and company didn't bail out Enron? The outrage lies in what politicians did for the company on its way up, not the way down.
By Scott Rosenberg, Salon.com
Jan. 18, 2002 | The collapse of Enron, we now hear, is not a ""political scandal"" -- it's a ""business story."" A fine distinction! So far, no one possesses evidence that government officials lied, goofed around with interns, ran guns from the White House basement, burglarized opponents' campaign offices or accepted bags of unmarked bills. And so a growing chorus in the media now chants that the Enron affair should not be considered in the same class as Whitewater, Watergate, Iran/Contra or any of the other previous brouhahas that have consumed Washington and brought presidencies to their knees. 
This tells us that the scandal yardstick our political and media culture currently uses is bent like a pretzel. You say your president may have finagled a real estate deal many years ago? Time to name a special prosecutor! He lied about his sex life? Draw up the articles of impeachment! But tell us that a high-profile corporation donated millions of dollars to legions of politicians, including the president; bent the government to its will; lined the pockets of its executives while dodging all taxes; then went bankrupt, vaporizing thousands of employees' retirement accounts? Nah, that's no ""political scandal."" Come on -- where're the bimbos? 
Enron's dismal story simply doesn't meet the high bar of triviality the press today demands. The sums of money involved are too great; the flaws in our political system that it exposes are too vast. It's just too real to qualify. 


USA: Enron lawyer raised partnership concerns-Salon.com.

NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - An Enron Corp. lawyer raised the alarm last summer at the energy trader about off-balance-sheet partnerships that helped drive it into bankruptcy, said Internet media company Salon.com on Friday. 
According to Salon.com, an Enron staff lawyer named Jordan Mintz, who was worried about the legality of the partnerships, last summer hired an outside law firm to review the complex partnerships without Enron's knowledge.
The law firm, Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson, recommended to Mintz that Enron should stop setting up the shell partnerships, Salon.com said, citing Enron sources. 
The New York law firm's opinion prompted Mintz to write internal memos to Enron executives urging the company to halt the practice. Salon.com said Enron apparently followed the advice. 
Minz declined to comment when contacted late Wednesday, citing attorney-client privilege, and Fried Frank did not return a telephone call, Salon.com said. 
The partnerships allowed Enron to keep debt off its books, gain higher credit ratings and help boost the company's profile among investors. Concerns about the murky partnerships led investors to dump Enron shares after the company reported its first quarterly loss in four years in October and later reduced its earnings over the same period by about $600 million. Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, the biggest in U.S. history.

Enron CEO under fire again 
Report: Lay knew of accounting problems when he exercised options. 

NEW YORK (CNN/Money) - Documents say that Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay sold shares of the energy trader's stock after receiving a letter warning of an accounting problem, according to a published report Friday.

The Arthur Andersen internal memos, including a letter from employee Sherron Watkins mentioning a meeting with Lay, were released yesterday by Congress, according to the New York Times. Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, is also under investigation for its accounting methods in the case.

Separately, another report emerged late Thursday that Enron corporate lawyer, Jordan Mintz, hired law firm Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson last summer to take another look at Enron's financial structure. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt worked at the law firm until last fall.

Fried Frank recommended that Enron end its partnership deals, Salon.com said.

The letter from Watkins, written Aug. 15, said she had scheduled a meeting with Lay on Aug. 20 to discuss the accounting issues. Lay exercised options on 93,620 shares for $2 million on Aug. 20 and Aug. 21, the report said.

While Lay did not report selling the shares, worth $3.5 million at the time, Enron officials said earlier this week that some of the money went to repay a loan, according to the Times.

Corporate stock sales must be disclosed by the tenth of the month in which the sale takes place, unless the shares are turned over to the company to repay a loan, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Enron's collapse. The firm's bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2 was the largest in U.S. history.

Thousands of employees lost their pensions and life's savings in the former Wall Street darling's downfall, which began last autumn when the firm acknowledged several hundred million dollars of previously undisclosed liabilities.

The saga has also embroiled Andersen, whose reviews of Enron's finances have come under heavy fire amid the firm's admission that employees destroyed a large number of e-mails and documents related to an audit of the energy trader.  
 

Enron Attorney Asks Judge to Approve Sale of Energy-Trading Operations
By Kathy Chu

Dow Jones Newswires 
NEW YORK -- An Enron Corp. attorney implored a federal judge here to approve the sale of its energy-trading operations to UBS AG in order to bring a ""failed"" business ""back to life.""
Martin Bienenstock, of Weil Gotshal & Manges, which represents the bankrupt energy company, said the core operation -- which generated about 90% of Enron's (ENRNQ) $101 billion in revenue last year -- may lose its value if the deal isn't closed soon. 
If the sale isn't approved, 600 traders and back-office staff could leave in the near future, taking their knowledge of the business with them, according to Steve Zelin, a senior managing partner in Blackstone Group's restructuring division. Blackstone serves as Enron's financial adviser in the deal. 
Under the deal with UBS (UBS), Enron could get more than $2 billion in royalties and other payments, according to Mr. Zelin, assuming that the Swiss bank eventually exercises a buyout option of the bankrupt company's profit stake. 
UBS, which has agreed to pay Enron 33% of the trading business' pretax royalties for at least two years, may be able to satisfy part of its commitment by issuing debt to Enron. 
The liquidation value of the trading operations is $40 million to $50 million, said Mr. Zelin.

Blackstone says Enron unit could earn 1-2 bln usd a year if UBS deal approved

01/18/2002

(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Blackstone Group managing director Steven Zelin said that Netco, the renamed wholesale energy trading unit of Enron Corp, could return to trading profits of 1-2 bln usd a year if UBS Warburg is given the go-ahead to acquire the unit. 
In testimony to a US bankruptcy court, Zelin, whose company is financial advisor to Enron and UBS, said that if the deal is blocked and the unit forced into liquidation, its value would probably be less than 50 mln usd.
The unit's trading book, which is not part of the deal, was once worth 13 bln usd, according to Blackstone's estimates, Zelin said. 
Zelin was testifying at a hearing at which the court is expected to announce its decision on whether or not it will approve the deal. 
The UBS Warburg offer is a complex financial transaction under which it would pay no cash upfront but instead pay a third of the unit's earnings in royalties over a ten-year period. 
The company would take over a staff of about 800 people along with computer systems and hardware.

Ruling on Enron sale expected Friday
Enron fires Andersen as auditor 
By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 8:35 AM ET Jan. 18, 2002
NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - A bankruptcy court judge is expected to rule Friday morning on whether Enron's plan to sell its energy trading assets to investment bank UBS Warburg can go forward.
The ruling is expects some time after 11 AM Eastern time from judge Arthur Gonzalez, of the Federal Bankruptcy court in Manhattan.
The meeting was originally scheduled for Thursday, but was bumped back a day after Enron and UBS requested more time to put together details of the proposed sale .
On Thursday, Enron fired its auditor, Andersen, citing the accounting firm's destruction of documents related to the energy company's finances. 
Separately, Andersen confirmed some details of a meeting in Feb. 2001 at which partners in the accounting firm debated continuing to serve as Enron's auditor despite concerns over limited partnerships formed by the energy company. 
Attorney Robert Bennett said Enron notified Andersen of the firing Thursday afternoon. ""We're very troubled about the destruction of the documents, and we're very concerned about the accounting advice we got,"" Bennett told the Associated Press. 
Late Thursday Andersen issued a news release confirming the February meeting at which Enron's limited partnerships were discussed. Andersen said the meeting was part of a routine review of risks and that no evidence of illegal actions or improper accounting was suspected during the meeting, or in a subsequent memo describing the discussions. 
Enron's formation of limited partnerships helped the company move high levels of debt off its books, improving the company's balance sheet. 
Earlier Thursday a federal judge overseeing all Enron lawsuits in Houston said she will hold a hearing Tuesday in connection with how and why Andersen destroyed Enron-related documents. 
Judge Melinda Harmon replaced Judge Lee Rosenthal this week. Rosenthal recused herself from the Enron cases with no explanation. She once was a partner at the law firm Baker & Botts, which is representing Dynegy, whose 2001 plan to merge with Enron was aborted. 
Harmon will hear Amalgamated Bank's request for expedited discovery and will consider a motion for a temporary restraining order prohibiting Andersen from destroying evidence. Andersen said it has ordered a halt to the destruction of any Enron-related documents. 
Andersen fired the man who served as its lead Enron auditor Tuesday.
David Duncan, the fired Andersen partner, met Wednesday with staff and attorneys for the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He denied any wrongdoing. 
Also on Thursday, House investigators requested that Andersen hand over additional notes or records from the 14 participants in a meeting five months ago into potential accounting landmines at Enron in a meeting five months ago. 
Amalgamated Bank is suing 29 Enron officers and directors along with Andersen for $25 billion in damages, alleging that the defendants sold more than $1 billion worth of shares while misrepresenting the financial state of the company.

Cheney discussed Enron with Indian leader

January 18, 2002 Posted: 12:50 PM EST (1750 GMT)

By John King
CNN Washington Bureau 

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Vice President Dick Cheney asked Indian opposition leader Sonia Gandhi last June about a multimillion-dollar debt owed to Enron from a major energy project in India, administration officials confirmed Friday. 
The officials told CNN the subject came up for only a moment at a meeting at the White House, and that no one at Enron asked Cheney to raise the issue. Cheney met with Ghandi to discuss general diplomatic issues affecting the U.S. and India. 
These two officials also noted that the taxpayer-financed Overseas Private Investment Corporation had a stake in the issue; OPIC could face payouts of perhaps $300 million, because it agreed to underwrite political risk insurance as part of the Enron deal. 
A Cheney aide said the vice president has had three meetings with Indian officials since the Bush administration took office. The $64 million Enron debt has come up just once, in the June 27th meeting with the opposition leader. 
The aide told CNN that Enron CEO Kenneth Lay ""never asked him to do it, no one at Enron asked him to talk about it. It was in the briefing papers Cheney received in advance of the meeting, and he asked about the status of the Enron project."" 
The officials noted the meeting was in June; it was several months later that Enron's financial problems began to surface. 
Administration officials say there was nothing improper about raising the Enron debt issue. But reports of Cheney's actions come at a time some Democrats in Congress are suggesting Enron benefited from its deep ties with senior Bush administration officials. 
Those Democrats are pressing for information on Enron-administration contacts and any administration actions that might have benefited Enron. 

 
USA: UPDATE 2-Cheney spoke to Indian officials on Enron project.
By Adam Entous

01/18/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Vice President Dick Cheney intervened with Indian officials last year as part of an effort to salvage a troubled Enron Corp. power project in India, the White House disclosed on Friday. 
The administration said Cheney's outreach on behalf of Enron, President George W. Bush's biggest political patron, was justified since the $2.9 billion Dabhol power project was financed in part through the U.S. government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC).
OPIC is a taxpayer-backed agency that provides ""political risk"" insurance and loans to help U.S. companies invest in developing nations. 
The administration said its actions were in no way influenced by Enron's political contributions to Bush. Enron was Bush's biggest political backer heading into the 2000 presidential election, making about $623,000 in contributions to his campaigns since 1993, when he was raising money for his first Texas gubernatorial race. 
""The United States taxpayers have an exposure to risk and loss through OPIC,"" White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters. ""It's not uncommon for (companies) to have exposures which do require contacts between American officials and government officials in other countries to minimize those risks to taxpayers."" 
The White House estimated OPIC's exposure to the Indian power project at $160 million in loans and $180 million in risk insurance. Separately, the U.S. Export-Import Bank made $300 million in direct loans to the plant. 
'NATIONAL INTEREST' CITED 
Fleischer said such interventions were commonplace and noted that former President Bill Clinton's commerce secretaries had made similar appeals on behalf of the Dabhol project during various phases of its development. 
""I don't think you could say that they were influenced by the contributions that were given to the Bush campaign. It was done because they thought it was in America's national interest to do it,"" Fleischer said. 
The White House has sought to distance itself from the widening scandal surrounding Enron, the energy-trading giant that collapsed in the autumn and filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2 after trying to solicit aid from the Bush administration. 
The White House says it did nothing to help the Houston-based energy trading company avert collapse as it monitored the situation. 
The Dabhol power plant, about 155 miles (250 kms) south of Bombay, has been idle since June due to a tariff dispute with its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the government-run monopoly distributor of electric power in the area. 
Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol, General Electric Co. and construction firm Bechtel Corp. each own 10 percent and MSEB the remaining 15 percent. OPIC was one of the many multilateral funding agencies that lent money to Dabhol. 
The plant was almost completed when construction on the 1,444-megawatt second phase was halted after the MSEB fell $240 million behind in payments for power provided. The 740-megawatt first phase began operating in May 1999. 
'DID NOT RISE TO THE PRESIDENT'S LEVEL' 
The Bush administration wanted the Indian government to reach an agreement with Enron and other investors to revive the stalled project. ""It is an important project to create jobs in America,"" Fleischer said. 
Cheney's office said the vice president raised the Enron issue at a June 27 meeting in Washington with Sonia Gandhi, the leader of the main Indian opposition Congress party. 
Officials said Cheney simply inquired into the project's status. They denied anyone from Enron had asked the vice president to intervene with Gandhi. 
OPIC had expected Bush to raise the issue with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in a Nov. 9 meeting, but Fleischer said the project was not discussed. 
""The vice president had raised it earlier, and the determination was made that this would be one of the issues that did not rise to the president's level,"" Fleischer said. 
Just days before the Vajpayee meeting, Enron chairman Kenneth Lay had called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans, Bush's 2000 campaign manager, to warn them of the company's mounting financial problems. 
In addition, Enron President Lawrence ""Greg"" Whalley called Treasury Undersecretary Peter Fisher in late October and early November, seeking help for the beleaguered company.

Cheney's Mention of Enron To Indian Politician Draws Attention

The White House confirming this morning that back last June, Vice President Dick Cheney, in a meeting at the White House with Indian Opposition Leader, Sonya Ghandi, raised the issue of a major energy project in which Enron is involved in India. In which Enron was owed some $64 million. 
DARYN KAGAN, CNN ANCHOR: Go ahead and switch gears to the --back in the U.S. and the Enron investigation. New information today involving Vice President Dick Cheney.
Our Senior White House Correspondent John King joining us this morning from the White House. John, good morning. 
JOHN KING, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Daryn. The White House confirming this morning that back last June, Vice President Dick Cheney, in a meeting at the White House with Indian Opposition Leader, Sonya Ghandi, raised the issue of a major energy project in which Enron is involved in India. In which Enron was owed some $64 million. 
We are told that in that meeting Vice President Cheney briefly said to Mrs. Ghandi, ""What is the status of the Enron project and the debt owed to Enron?"" Now, White House officials saying there is nothing unusual about this, and they in no way, say, was the vice president reaching out to help Enron. They say that no one at Enron asked for him to mention this. They say the reason it came up, is because this $3 billion plant in India, in which Enron and several other U.S. companies are involved, is insured by the Overseat Private Investment Corporation, a little known federal agency. But $300 million of taxpayers' money the White House says at stake in the insurance for that project. There was some troubling with financing. 
So they say the vice president briefly mentioned it in this meeting. Aides say the vice president can't even recall mentioning it now that it has come up, but notes do say -- do show that he did mention it. 
Now, why does this matter? The administration says no improper activity. No request from Enron for that help. But Democrats in Congress, of course, want to know everything about any dealings between administration officials and Enron and anything the administration might have done to help Enron. So you can be certain as Democrats in Congress ask for more information about contacts between the company and the administration, that this new revelation, that the vice president did bring this up briefly, in a meeting with an Indian politician here at the White House will now be the focus of those Democratic inquiries as well. 
Again, the White House says the vice president did nothing wrong. Daryn. KAGAN: And, John, I want to ask you about a story I saw in today's ""Washington Post."" Reports out of Saudi Arabia that that government could soon want the U.S. military presence to be gone from that country. What would that mean for the U.S.? And, isn't that exactly what Osama bin Laden has been fighting and pushing for, for so many years? 
KING: Well, it is what Osama bin Laden has been pushing for. U.S. officials say they don't know much about this story. They say there have been no requests by the government of Saudi Arabia --anyone at a senior level at all. Secretary of State Colin Powell said today, it has never come up in his meetings with Saudi leaders. The Defense Department says it has never come up in their meetings with Saudi leaders. The White House saying today, no one here at the White House has had any conversations of that such with senior Saudi officials. 
So the White House says it doesn't know how serious this is. Behind the scenes here, they say they're not so pleased that Saudi officials would be talking about this publicly. 
The U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia numbers about 5,000 troops, and includes the Prince Sultan Air Base. That is a state-of-the-art command-and-control center being used right now to direct the war in Afghanistan and the other U.S. military presence around that region. It is no secret to anybody that it is a very severe complication for the domestic politics of the Saudi regime to have such a large U.S. military presence in the country. Again, it dates back to the Persian Gulf War. 
But no one here says that the United States has been asked to leave, and they say the president very much values the U.S. presence in the region. 
KAGAN: John King at the White House. John, thank you very much.

Enron Fires Andersen As Auditor
Congressional Investigators Arrive Thursday
Posted: 9:09 a.m. CST January 17, 2002
Updated: 6:00 p.m. CST January 17, 2002
Channel 2, Houston
HOUSTON -- The Enron Corp. <http://www.enron.com> Board of Directors voted Thursday to discharge Andersen <http://www.Andersen.com> as the company's auditor. 
""As announced on Oct. 31, the Enron Board of Directors convened a Special Committee to look into accounting and other issues relating to certain transactions,"" said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron Chairman and CEO. ""While we had been willing to give Andersen the benefit of the doubt until the completion of that investigation, we can't afford to wait any longer in light of recent events, including the reported destruction of documents by Andersen personnel and the disciplinary actions taken against several of Andersen's partners working in its Houston office."" 
""We're very troubled about the destruction of the documents, and we're very concerned about the accounting advice we got,"" said Robert Bennett, a Washington attorney representing Enron. 
Bennett said that Enron informed Andersen of the dismissal late Thursday afternoon. 
The firing came as congressional investigators pressed the accounting firm for more documents concerning Enron's business activities. 
The House Energy and Commerce Committee released documents from Andersen showing that nearly a year ago the accounting firm had strong misgivings about Enron's use of partnerships that kept hundreds of millions of dollars in losses off Enron's balance sheet. 
Enron will immediately begin the selection process for a new external auditor. 
Congressional Investigators In Houston
Congressional investigators will return to the Enron Corp's headquarters in Houston Friday, searching for clues as to what may have caused the company's downfall and the involvement of its auditing firm Andersen. 
""It's now clear to us that key players at Andersen as well as Enron knew of the growing problems months before the company imploded,"" said Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Four investigators from the House committee arrived at about mid-morning Thursday, at about the same time Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay showed up. 
Sources told News2Houston that the investigators were in Houston to talk to Enron's chief accounting officer, Richard Causey; and Richard Buy, vice president and chief risk officer. 
So far, they have not asked to speak with Sherron Watkins, Enron vice president, sources said. 
On Wednesday, it was disclosed that Watkins told a friend and former colleague at Andersen on Aug. 20 that she had concerns about Enron's accounting practices. 
It was revealed that Watkins warned Enron's chairman, Kenneth Lay, about her concerns, which focused on outside partnerships used by Enron executives to keep hundreds of millions of dollars in debt off the company's books. 
A hurried meeting at Andersen's Houston office took place Aug. 21 and Duncan participated. The meeting occurred the day before Watkins detailed her serious concerns in a meeting with Lay. 
Watkins' attorney told News2Houston that his client hasn't been contacted about an interview on Thursday. 
The House committee's trip had been planned for Thursday, prior to the revelation that some Enron documents had been shredded. 
The committee on Wednesday interviewed an Andersen auditor fired for destroying documents in the Enron affair who told congressional investigators he was just following the advice of the accounting firm's lawyers. 
The former chief auditor for Andersen's Enron account, David Duncan, was questioned for several hours Wednesday. 
Duncan ""cooperated fully with our investigators,"" Johnson said. ""He answered all of our questions."" 
Congressional sources said he told investigators Andersen's lawyers suddenly began emphasizing the firm's policy allowing destruction of some documents. 
He said in September, general discussions began at Andersen of what Enron-related documents to discard. 
An Andersen spokesman isn't commenting. 
Andersen has said Duncan organized the destruction of key documents after learning the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking Enron accounting information. 
The effort came to an end when Duncan's assistant sent out an e-mail ordering secretaries to ""stop the shredding."" 
The Andersen accounting firm didn't just monitor Enron's books. 
Some executives came to occupy key financial positions at Enron, where they used their former company to do inside as well as outside auditing work for the now-failed energy-trading firm. 
An Enron spokeswoman said the company does not view Andersen's multiple roles as a conflict. 
Earlier Wednesday, the White House disclosed it had been concerned about how a potential Enron collapse would affect the economy. 
It said it had economic adviser Larry Lindsey, a former Enron board member, study the issue. But President Bush wasn't told about the study or the results. And Lindsey said he had no contact with Enron officials. 
A hearing has been scheduled for Jan. 22 in Houston Federal Judge Belinda Harmon's courtroom. 
Harmon granted a request by one of Enron's largest creditors, Amalgamated Bank, for a temporary restraining order against Andersen to stop them shredding any more documents. 


USA: Florida subpoenaes Enron papers in pension probe.

MIAMI, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The Florida Attorney General's office has subpoenaed documents from Enron Corp. as part of a racketeering investigation into the sale of the energy company's stock to the state pension fund while the share price was plunging, investigators said on Friday. 
The state also subpoenaed documents from former Enron auditor Andersen and from Alliance Capital, the investment management company that bought Enron's stock for Florida's pension fund, investigators said.
The subpoenas were served on Thursday, Mary Leontakianakos, chief of the state attorney general's economic crimes section, said. 
""We asked for documents relating to the incidents that led up to their (Enron's) downfall and of course, anything related to the purchase of the stock by Florida and the pension fund,"" Leontakianakos told Reuters by telephone. 
Florida's pension fund lost $320 million on its investment in some 7 million shares of Enron stock. 
Enron's shares, which peaked at $90.56 in August 2000, were delisted by the New York Stock Exchange earlier this month and now trade over-the-counter. In late afternoon trade on Friday, Enron's shares were trading at 52 cents, after having fallen earlier in the day to a new low of 35 cents.

POWER POINTS: Enron Energy Services Still In The Game
By Mark Golden

01/18/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Okay, so how about some good news about Enron Corp. (ENRNQ ENE)?
More than two months after energy producers began to cut off supplies to Enron, the company's Energy Services division continues to provide gas and power - one way or another - to hundreds of industrial and commercial customers under contract. 
That comes as a surprise to many who thought the unit would deteriorate faster than it has. 
""We're doing what it takes to keep the contracts going,"" said Enron Energy Services spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney. 
In fact, most of the contracts are intact, Mahoney said. 
Some are very lucrative for Enron, particularly those signed between the summer of 2000 and the summer of 2001, when gas and power prices were flying high. 
Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY), for example, signed a $1.3 billion, 15-year electricity and natural gas management deal with Enron Energy Services last February. 
""We still have a contract with Enron,"" said Lilly spokeswoman Joan Todd, who added that if Enron failed to meet its deliveries, Lilly could resume managing its own energy supply. 
Other large companies that signed multi-year deals with Enron during the bull market in energy include JC Penney Co. (JCP), Saks Inc. (SKS), Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ) and Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT), which signed a $1 billion 10-year deal in September. 
""Our energy needs are being met by Enron,"" said Stephanie Brown, spokeswoman for JCPenny, which signed a $600 million deal covering electric supply at 1,250 stores last February. At that time, wholesale power in the West for this year was trading at $125 a megawatt-hour. The price now for the rest of this year is $30/MWh. Eastern U.S. power prices haven't been that volatile. 
Enron Energy Services was a rising star before Enron's collapse. After three years of operation, EES became profitable in 2000. By last fall, it was managing energy at more than 31,000 customer sites, and Enron's competitors have been salivating at the thought of picking up some of EES' business. 
Much of that business, to be sure, is already gone. On Jan. 3, Enron received bankruptcy court approval to terminate 600 to 700 energy services contracts, which were presumably not profitable for EES. 
And some customers, like Harrah's Entertainment Inc. (HET), jumped at the opportunity to exit expensive Enron contracts in favor of the low prices in today's depressed energy markets. Harrah's was able to replace its Enron supply at considerably lower cost, spokesman Gary Thompson said. 
But many Enron customers don't have a bankruptcy clause in their contracts that allows a unilateral exit, as Harrah's did. JCPenny's Brown, for instance, said that so long as Enron continues to supply power, the contract remains in force. 
And not all Enron deals done during the energy market's bull run are necessarily at prices much richer than the current market. The contracts are highly customized. While fixed-price deals like the one with Harrah's were lucrative for Enron, many deals have flexible pricing that reflects, at least partially, the market correction. 
So, as long as Enron keeps delivering, some customers have little incentive to dump EES. ""For the most part, we're finding that customers are pleased to be on their contract, and they're waiting to see what the next step is,"" Mahoney said. 
The next step will be Enron's reorganization plan. Selling some EES contracts, selling the entire division, or trying to keep EES as a part of a reorganized Enron are all being considered, Mahoney said. 
Keeping The Juice Flowing Is Tricky 

Without any credit, Enron traders have managed to get some gas and power from producers by prepaying for supplies, traders for several energy companies said. 
""They wire the money in the afternoon, and the energy flows the next day,"" said one. 
Other approaches are being used to keep as much of the business going as possible, too. 
Lilly, for example, gets some of its supply via an Enron subsidiary that isn't in bankruptcy. Compaq continues to get energy under the five-year deal it signed with Enron in October 2000, though it has made a partial end-run around Enron by signing a deal with the ultimate suppliers, too. 
""We've made arrangements to make sure the energy providers get paid,"" said Compaq spokesman Arch Currid, who declined to be more specific. But, barring some development in the bankruptcy process, Enron continues to manage Compaq's energy supply. 
Quaker Oats, now a division of Pepsico Inc. (PEP), recently decided that its power and gas ""contract with Enron is no longer in effect,"" spokeswoman Susan Schreiber said. And while Enron has managed to keep some of its supply to Starwood Hotels going, it has been cut out of other Starwood sites, a Starwood spokeswoman said. 
At the time of Enron's bankruptcy filing Dec. 2, EES had assets of about $2.5 billion and liabilities of $2.1 billion. 
Energy services is a good business, but a credit-dependent one, like wholesale trading, said Andre Meade, chief utilities analyst of Commerzbank. The longer it goes on under a non-creditworthy entity, the more customers and employees will flee. 
""The best bet to get value out of the division would be to auction it off,"" Meade said. ""But the clock is ticking.""

Pataki giving donation from wife of Enron chief to employees' fund

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki is donating a $5,000 campaign contribution he received from the wife of Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay to a fund set up to aid employees of the failed energy giant, a spokesman said Friday. 
Pataki aide Michael McKeon said the money, received Aug. 1 from Linda Lay, was being sent to the Houston fund.
The Texas-based company filed for bankruptcy protection last month and has laid off thousands of employees. 
The company was a major political contributor to President Bush's campaign and to other Republicans, but also gave heavily to Democrats. 
On Wednesday, Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he had donated almost $69,000 in campaign contributions from Enron and its accounting firm, Arthur Anderson LLP, to the employees' fund. 
Schumer, who received $30,273 in Enron contributions, sits on the Senate Banking Committee and the Energy Committee, both of which are planning hearings on the company. 
On Friday, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton said she would donate the $950 she got from Enron employees to the fund to aid Enron employees.

Brazil's federal energy company Petrobras is eyeing the stake that US-based power company Enron owns in Argentine natural gas transport company Transportadora de Gas del Sur (TGS), according to business newspaper Buenos Aires Economico.
Bankrupt Enron owns 50% of the Ciesa holding company, which in turn owns 70% of TGS stock. Argentina's Pecom Energia owns the other 50% of Ciesa. 
Petrobras recently closed a US$1bn asset swap with Repsol-YPF that gave the Brazilian firm control of the 30,000bpd Bahia Blanca refinery and nearly 700 service stations in Argentina.

Enron subsidiary in Bothell strapped for cash

01/18/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

BOTHELL, Wash. (AP) - An Enron subsidiary in this north Seattle suburb is struggling to pay its bills since the collapse of the Houston-based energy giant. 
National Energy Production Corp., a 64-year-old power plant contractor that employs about 3,700 people worldwide, is seeking a buyer or a bailout since Enron last month ""swept"" up its cash.
Enron, like many large firms, has a centralized cash-management system that can handle money for subsidiaries. However, after Enron swept up NEPCO's cash, it filed for bankruptcy protection. NEPCO is not part of the filing, but the funds that were absorbed by Enron were frozen in court. 
NEPCO since has bounced checks to suppliers, and has asked customers, including utilities in the United States and overseas, to amend their contracts and provide cash so it can continue power-plant construction, The Seattle Times reported Friday, citing an internal memo sent last month from NEPCO President John Gillis. 
""Enron swept NEPCO's cash before it was applied to pay project costs,"" said Laura Plumb, a spokeswoman for Tampa Electric Co., or Teco, which had hired NEPCO to build four power plants around the United States. 
In some cases, customers have been asked to pay for work a second time, because funds to pay subcontractors and vendors were swept into Enron, The Times reported. 
""NEPCO has had to go back to the client and say, 'Can you give us that money again?""' said Richard Korman, a senior editor at Engineering News-Record, a trade journal, who obtained the Gillis memo and reported on NEPCO's troubles. 
The company has orders to build 14 natural-gas-fired generators through 2003, according to its Web site. 
Besides the immediate cash woes, NEPCO was sued last week by German bank Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentral. The company borrowed $24 million from the bank that was swept up by Enron before the parent filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2. 
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, alleges NEPCO knew but did not disclose the harm it would suffer because of Enron's financial troubles. 
NEPCO had felt some effects from Enron's problems even before the bankruptcy filing. Uncertainty about the parent company prompted Calpine, an independent power producer, to terminate NEPCO's contract to build a power plant in Goldendale. 
Calpine hired another contractor for the $125 million project, scheduled to be finished next summer. 
""We are moving quickly to bring the plant online, and we wanted to be assured that we had the right team to do it,"" Calpine spokesman Kent Robertson said. 
The cash crunch has prompted NEPCO to look for potential buyers. 
""The executive team is working with organizations that are interested in a possible cash infusion/ownership of NEPCO going forward,"" Gillis wrote in his memo, dated Dec. 2, the same day Enron filed for bankruptcy protection. 
Gillis declined to be interviewed, The Times said. 
NEPCO employs about 600 people at its Bothell headquarters. 
The company was founded in 1938, as Bumstead-Woolford by Dale Bumstead and O.H. Woolford. Initially they helped boilermakers sell equipment to plants and pulp mills in the Northwest. 
The firm began installing boilers during World War II, and in the 1970s entered the forest-products industry, eventually establishing a holding company called National Energy Production and moving into general contracting for power-plant construction. 
It was acquired by Zurn Industries of Pennsylvania in 1982, and in 1997 was sold by Zurn to Enron Engineering and Construction Co., a subsidiary of Enron Corp.

USA: UPDATE 1-Moody's may change the way it rates companies.

01/18/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Responding to severe market criticism, Moody's Investors Service said on Friday it was considering making changes in how it rates companies. 
The changes, which Moody's said it should be ready to discuss in a few weeks, could cause ratings to rise or fall faster, affecting companies' ability to raise money and, in some cases, to do business.
The review by one of the three leading U.S. credit rating agencies - the others are Standard & Poor's and Fitch - follows criticism of the agencies' perceived lack of speed in downgrading troubled energy trader Enron Corp.'s ratings to junk status in November. 
""We are considering a number of measures to improve the timeliness of rating actions, in response to criticism from the market about that timeliness,"" said Debra Perry, Moody's senior managing director in corporate and public finance. 
She said Moody's was preparing a ""special comment"" on the matter that should be issued ""in a few weeks."" She did not cite criticism of any specific rating activity as having precipitated the review. 
Perry said the changes could include more multi-notch upgrades or downgrades of company ratings; a speeding up of rating reviews ""into a matter of weeks, rather than a few months;"" and perhaps the elimination of rating outlooks. 
""There is a school of thought within Moody's that our ratings are too 'sticky,' or move too slowly, to reflect our true opinions about companies' risks,"" she said. ""Some people in Moody's argue we should accept greater volatility in order to improve the predictive power of ratings, and we understand that could be controversial among market participants. We don't intend any fundamental changes in policy without having first gone through a significant amount of market dialogue."" 
CRITICISM 
A rise in negative rating actions would depress bond prices and leave many companies facing higher funding costs or more difficulty in raising money, especially as the U.S. economy wades through recession. 
Following Enron's unraveling, Arthur Levitt, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, wrote in The New York Times that rating agencies have ""quasi-public responsibilities"" and ""should show greater accountability."" 
Earlier this week, S&P and Fitch told Reuters that since the Enron blow-up, they have in their rating activity begun focusing more on liquidity, or the ability of companies to access the cash they need to run their businesses. 
Analysts have said that all three agencies - which companies pay for ratings, needed to sell securities - have been particularly aggressive downgrading ailing discount retailer Kmart Corp.'s ratings to low ""junk"" grades. 
A policy shift ""could have the effect of making it more difficult for (borderline) credits to survive an economic downturn,"" said CreditSights Inc., a New York-based fixed-income research service, in a report. 
""If Moody's moves ahead with these changes,"" it added, ""it would mark a major structural change in the corporate bond market that could lead to structurally higher volatility."" 
Moody's said investors should not view its Kmart downgrades as reflecting any prospective policy shift. ""When we think there has been a significant change on credit quality, we need to call it, even if it means taking very swift action,"" said Angela Jameson, a Moody's managing director in retail. 
Perry said Moody's does not consider companies, its clients, as the only entities its ratings serve. 
""Our primary constituencies are investors, intermediaries who underwrite securities and issuers,"" she said. ""We recognize that they are sometimes not aligned.""

THE SKEPTIC: Accountants Under The Microscope Post-Enron
By Alen Mattich

01/18/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN 

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Issues bedeviling the accounting profession for years have finally flashed into the headlines, thanks to Enron and the bursting of the Internet bubble.
Unhappily, most are unlikely to be solved anytime soon. 
Questions of auditor independence and the use of pro forma statements are at the fore. Not far behind are ones on accounting for options and goodwill. And then there's the issue of which standards to use. 
Right now, ""who guards the guardians"" has leapfrogged to the top of the agenda. 
The Enron collapse shows that auditors need to be more independent. It's a thinly-disguised fiction that auditors are paid by and act on behalf of shareholders. Clearly, it's corporate management doing the hiring and firing of auditors. 
And audit itself makes little profit. Instead, accountants rely on consulting and more technical or specialized practices, like M&A, to generate fees. An accountant refusing to pass a company's results runs the risk of losing a big part of his own business. Even the risk of litigation isn't - or at least hasn't been pre-Enron - enough of a deterrent. 
What's the solution? Make sure companies that audit aren't swayed by conflicts of interest. 
Regulators should either encourage stand-alone audit firms or prohibit auditors from any other involvement with the companies they scrutinize - even if that's tricky for big international corporations, which can use all of the ""big five"" accounting firms in the course of a year's global dealings. 
Another dilemma is the issue of pro formas. 
There's a mounting consensus that pro forma statements are suspect. According to some estimates, pro forma results for S&P 500 companies during the third quarter overstated audited profits by 70%. 
Why should companies push their pro formas when, after all, there's a perfectly good U.S. audited accounting standard: the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)? 
Enron notwithstanding, surveys show investors are more confident with U.S. corporate results than those from Europe or Japan. And yet, U.S. GAAP has its own problems. 
U.S. accounting is rigidly based on rules, unlike elsewhere, where it's more a case of applying broad principles. 
Though these rules are designed to ensure standards, they're often subverted by loopholes. U.S. companies can comply with the letter of the law but still offer a distorted picture of fundamentals. The result is that while investors are flooded with information, it's not always helpful in determining a company's value. 
Enron highlighted one such loophole. The company went under in large part because it was taking on huge, unseen liabilities. These liabilities weren't on the balance sheet, having been planted on special vehicles nominally independent of the firm. 
Under U.S. accounting practice, if another party owns more than 3% of a special vehicle, its liabilities don't need to be reported on the majority holder's balance sheet. As Enron showed - though there are also suggestions of fraud - 97% of a liability can be a lot not to report. 
Another loophole is the failure of companies - especially high tech firms - to report a big component of their costs. For example, options paid to employees don't enter into the profit and loss account under U.S. GAAP rules. This can have a significant effect if a company pays employees in part with options. But the debate goes deeper than
a matter of loopholes. 

Companies and investors have argued that accounting standards don't capture the truth of a company's performance, that underlying performance is hidden by the noise of special factors, and that things like goodwill accounting make a nonsense of the balance sheet. 
Its apologists, however, would have a stronger case if so many pro forma statements weren't such an obvious attempt to cheerlead or to obscure the audited numbers. 
During the height of the tech bubble, companies routinely wrote gains generated by minority investments into their pro-forma profits. But now that the value of these investments has crashed, they're disregarded as ""exceptionals."" 
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which sets U.S. accounting rules, is taking an urgent look at the implications of the Enron case. And the International Accounting Standards Board is in the midst of a two-year review that's trying to rationalize international standards. 
Good luck to them both. Given the state of the industry and the complexity of the debate, they'll need it.

Enron 'winners' outside Beltway
Neither party can benefit

By Howard Fineman <mailto:howardfineman@aol.com>
SPECIAL TO MSNBC.COM

WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 -  I finally realized who in the capital is damaged most by the Enron collapse: everybody. The company's rise and fall exposes the unpleasant truth that our political system runs on Big Money. But neither Republicans nor Democrats can benefit from the scandal, since both are complicit in creating the sordid reality Enron now symbolizes.

       THE POLITICAL winners are elsewhere, I think, outside the Beltway: independents with a plague-on-both-their-houses view of politics as we know it. All they need to ignite a firestorm is a leader who can credibly declare war on ""The System."" Then, look out. Ross Perot flamed out. Jesse Ventura is no longer a rising star. 
       Sen. John McCain's story is complicated; he's part of the culture he fitfully decries. 
       But, as Yoda says in ""Star Wars,"" ""There is another."" Enron makes it likely we'll see him or her in 2004.
       
CAMPAIGN-FINANCE DISCONNECT
       Ask Americans what issues concern them, and campaign-finance reform is low on the list. But for independent activists, voters and organizers alike, there is no more important issue. If members of Congress want to dampen the energy of the Third Force, they need to finally enact a credible reform of the money-for-access system that Enron used with such skill until the merry-go-round stopped late last year. 
       There is more fallout from the Enron collapse. It signals the arrival of a new issue at the centerpiece of politics: retirement security for the always self-obsessed and selfish Baby Boom generation. As the century began, it seemed the Boomers were, for the most part, headed for Easy Street. The federal budget was showing mounting surpluses. Politicians were vowing to protect Social Security funds in a mythical ""lockbox."" Workers' 401(k)'s were bulging with portfolios of ever-rising stocks.
       
TRIPLE WHAMMY
       The triple whammy of recession, terrorist attacks and Enron collapse have left the Boomers - a cadre of 73 million now beginning to march into the land of early retirement - suddenly worrying about the finances of their later years. 
       That, in turn, has changed the politics of taxes, the budget and Social Security. It is going to be harder for the president to sell the country on the idea of socking away stocks as an alternative to the federal program. It's going to be harder to argue for 
       further tax cuts, even if most people are strongly in favor of preserving the ones that were enacted last year. And the Democrats are going to push for new rules governing corporate finance, which is sure to cause a fight with defenders of business in the GOP.
       So far, Enron has done nothing to tarnish George W. Bush's standing as a very popular leader in the post 9/11 age. There is no indication that he was was aware of, of interested in, the fate of Enron. He says he wants the matter investigated, and four government agencies and six congressional committees are obliging him. But this is a case in which Bush's penchant for delegating the details could come back to haunt him. 
       
WHAT DOES BUSH KNOW?
       What kinds of dealings did his underlings (and his vice president) have with Enron? I'm not sure he knows. He had better find out. Fast. In this kind of environment, he needs to find someone utterly loyal to him - and uninvolved in the matter at hand - to tell him exactly what was going on while he was busy with other things, like fighting a war.
        Unless, of course, Bush knew about the Enron situation all along - about the company's participation in drafting the administration's energy plan (which critics now say was an Enron Empowerment Plan) to the company's dismal and desperate final days. If the president knew more than he's let on, he's better say so now, before the dreaded ""C Word"" - cover-up - gets attached to his name. That's the real import of the story: a test in managing the truth for an administration that promised to bring a new moral tone to Washington.

Florida governor speaks at father's presidential museum
By MICHAEL GRACZYK
Associated Press Writer

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) - Florida Gov. Jeb Bush spoke Friday at his father's presidential library at Texas A&M University, avoiding any controversial topics while touting his accomplishments in office. 
A day after a fund-raiser at the Houston home of a former president of beleaguered Enron Corp., Bush never mentioned the now-bankrupt company headed by family friend Kenneth Lay.
The governor fielded about a dozen questions from an overflow crowd of more than 400 at the conference center at the George Bush Presidential Library Center but refused to speak with reporters. 
""Because of our geography, the world impacts us more than most states in terms of immigration, trade, the flow of illegal drugs - all sorts of things,"" said Bush, who was introduced to the podium by his father. 
""Because of our peninsula status, we really have one foot immersed in North America, one firmly established in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. 
""We have a real understanding the world is shrinking and it's important for us to be as competitive as we possibly can around the world."" 
Bush said his single greatest challenge was overhauling education in his state and he described himself as the governor who changed the status quo. 
""I think over a generation there was feeling you couldn't make a difference, you couldn't really change things because government had gotten so unresponsive and big,"" he said. 
""I just sensed in the early '90s and into the millennium there is a sense of cynicism about government. To be honest with you, some of our elected officials made it even worse in terms of their own integrity and perceptions."" 
He said in Florida he reorganized the ""tired old practices of quotas and set-asides"" by expanding opportunities for minorities, doubling procurements for minority businesses and implementing a grading system for public schools. 
""We do have incredibly talented teachers and people so committed to our kids, but we had a system that didn't measure and didn't hold people accountable and made excuses that some kids were learning and some kids weren't."" 
During the question-and-answer session, Bush said signing a death warrant for condemned prisoners is his toughest task as governor, called the 1994 gubernatorial election loss his greatest experience and touted his trimming of Florida's state work force. 
""I don't think the focus of government should be hiring people,"" he said. 
He stayed away from politics for the most part, jabbing at the Clinton administration only briefly for its handling of the case of Elian Gonzalez, the young boy who was removed from the Miami home of his relatives and returned to his native Cuba. Bush said it ""tore the scab off relations in our community."" 
The Democratic Party chairman in Florida questioned Bush's judgment for the fund-raiser Thursday at the Houston home of Richard Kinder, who left Enron years ago. Bush's campaign chief noted Kinder, who since has established his own energy firm, has no ties to Enron. 
At the same time, Florida officials are investigating whether a firm that made investments for the state's pension fund acted improperly when it bought 311,000 shares of Enron stock on the day the Securities and Exchange Commission said it would investigate Enron. 
The purchase was among 4.9 million shares of Enron bought for the fund between August and October. After Enron filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2, the pension fund dumped the shares, taking more than a $300 million loss.

Former Enron Lobbyist Racicot Elected Republican Chairman

AUSTIN, Texas (AP)--The Republican National Committee elected Marc Racicot, a former state governor and lobbyist for Enron Corp.(ENRNQ), as party chairman Friday, brushing off concerns about his ties to the failed energy giant. 
President George W. Bush tapped Racicot, former governor of Montana, for the position last month as part of a move to strengthen the party as it heads into this year's elections, when control of Congress and dozens of state houses is at stake.
The previous party chairman, former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, resigned in December after resounding Republican losses in gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia. 
Racicot, a partner in Bracewell & Patterson, a Texas law firm with an office in Washington, lobbied for now-bankrupt Enron last year. He will continue to draw a salary from the law firm, but he has said he will end all lobbying work once he takes the Republican Party's top job and will forgo his salary from the Republican National Committee. 
Republicans say publicly that Racicot's ties to Enron and the company's large campaign donations to Bush and other politicians shouldn't hurt the party in the upcoming elections. Several federal and state investigations are looking into the company's financial collapse. 
But some have suggested privately that Racicot's selection gives Democrats an easy target and say he should sever ties to the law firm. 
Racicot pledged to continue aggressive fund raising while ""adhering to the highest ethical standards and upholding the trust of the American people.""

Carson returns Enron contribution

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - One member of Oklahoma's congressional delegation has returned a contribution from Enron Corp., the beleaguered energy company. 
Rep. Brad Carson, D-Okla., has donated a $1,000 campaign contribution from Enron to a relief fund for former employees of the scandal-plagued firm.
""He feels that is the right thing to do,"" said Brad Luna, Carson's press secretary. 
Enron and its officers donated $40,000 in campaigns across the state, federal and state records show. 
Some lawmakers are moving to distance themselves from Enron by returning the donations or giving like amounts to charity. 
Besides Carson, no other member of Oklahoma's delegation has returned or donated the contributions. 
U.S. Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., received the most in contributions from Enron. Nickles received about $7,000 in donations since 1989, records show. 
He also took a loss on Enron stock, purchasing 200 shares of stock on Dec. 22, 2000, at $79.40 and selling it on Jan. 11 of 2001 at $69.70, according to Gayle Osterberg, his press secretary. 
""He had it a few weeks, lost about $2,000 and thought why did I buy that in the first place,"" Osterberg said. 
Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., took in about $2,550 in campaign contribution from Enron, the center said. 
More than $700,000 in campaign donations has gone from Enron to the members of seven congressional committees investigating its collapse, including $2,000 to Rep. Frank Lucas, R-Okla. None of the lawmakers has decided to drop out of the probe. 
U.S. Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., received more than $5,000 over the last eight years, the tops among the state's six House members. 
""They were legal and legitimate contributions that predated any of Enron's current financial controversy,"" said Mike Willis, Largent's chief of staff. 
Largent is now running for governor. The Houston-based company didn't contribute to his gubernatorial campaign. 
Enron did give $2,000 to Gov. Frank Keating's inauguration in January 1995. Keating later refunded $451, records show. 
The company donated $1,000 to Keating's re-election campaign in 1998. 
""Until the fall of last year, there was no reason to question any contribution from Enron,"" said Phil Bacharach, Keating's deputy press secretary. 
Enron and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, are trying to pin responsibility on each other for allowing questionable financial practices to continue and push Enron toward bankruptcy. 
Enron abruptly has fired Andersen, citing its destruction of thousands of documents and its accounting advice. 
Andersen said its relationship with Enron ended in early December when the company slid into the biggest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
Thousands of employees lost their jobs and many had their retirement accounts - predominantly in Enron stock - essentially wiped out.

Sen. Clinton to donate Enron campaign contributions to fund to help employees

NEW YORK (AP) - Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday that she would donate her campaign contributions from Enron to a charitable fund being set up to help employees of the failed energy giant. 
She joins a growing list of lawmakers unloading Enron Corp. contributions as questions arise about the company's collapse.
Clinton received $950 from Enron employees during her Senate campaign, according to the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics. She said she would also donate any contributions she received from Enron's accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. 
""I think it's the appropriate thing to do,"" Clinton told The Associated Press on Friday. 
New York's other senator, Charles Schumer, announced earlier this week that he was donating $68,857 he received from Enron and Andersen to the employee fund. Schumer sits on the Senate Banking Committee and the Energy Committee, both of which are planning hearings on Enron. 
Enron's rapid fall into bankruptcy wiped out the savings for many employees who were barred from selling Enron shares from their retirement accounts as the stock price plunged. Top executives cashed out more than $1 billion in company stock when it was near its peak. 
Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said he was one of 71 senators to receive money from the Enron Political Action Committee. He said this week he would give the $500 he received to the fund for former employees.

GETTING PERSONAL: 401(k) Woes? Might Be Your Own Fault
By Kaja Whitehouse

01/18/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) debacle has some people thinking ""401(k)"" is the newest four-letter word.
Actually, though, many employees have no one to blame for their 401(k) problems but themselves. 
Washington is abuzz with talk of ""reform"" of the 401(k) system, with lawmakers using the Enron bankruptcy - where thousands of employees lost large chunks of their nest eggs - as a chance to fiddle with plan designs. 
To truly free investors of risk, legislators would have to send the 401(k) the way of the pension, and that is unlikely. By definition, defined-contribution plans were meant to allow people to save as much as possible and place that money in investment funds most suitable to their needs. Pension plans, on the other hand, promise to pay out a certain amount when workers retire, depending on how many years they worked for a company. 
At best, our public officials will cap the amount of company stock in which a person can invest in a retirement plan. But that won't solve other problems, such as workers' failure to diversify or to switch to more conservative investments as they age. 
Call it a consequence of free will. Some people just don't pay enough attention to how they save for retirement. Here's the best example: The period from 1999 to 2000 was volatile for markets, but investors did nothing to shield their retirement savings. Rather, the average asset allocation of 401(k) participants remained the same in that period, according to a November study by the trade groups Employee Benefits Research Institute and the Investment Company Institute. 
Despite the newfound attention, it's not a new phenomenon, said Tom Samuels, chief investment officer at Stavis, Margolis Advisory Services. About 50% of the people who walk into the Houston firm have ""picked an allocation when they started and let it go on autopilot,"" he said. 
Other Options Available 

Accepting a 401(k) plan should entail taking the time to make sure assets are invested wisely. The 401(k) is a great investment vehicle, ""but if it's not used properly, it doesn't work,"" said Thomas Endersbe, a certified financial planner with American Express in St. Paul, Minn. 
People who don't have the time to care for their 401(k) plan should consider other options. A lot of plan sponsors also offer pensions, which are considered safer because they are backed by federal insurance. ""If 60% of your retirement income is replaced by a (pension), maybe you can take a more casual view of your 401(k),"" said Janna Gjesdal, associate editor of the Institute of Management & Administration, a New York research firm. 
Understandably, some people just might not like the investment options offered by their 401(k) plan, especially if it's too tied up in company stock. 
If your employee match is limited to company stock that you can't convert for some time, as it was for Enron's employees, stay away from investing additional dollars in the company. This may mean forgoing company stock purchase plans that allow workers to buy company shares cheap. 
Also, when adding up your assets, exclude significant stock holdings until the cash is in your hands. This will force you to build up assets in other areas. 
Don't forget Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs, as a diversification tool. Contribution limits for an IRA are much smaller - $3,000 this year compared with $11,000 for a 401(k) - but anyone can invest in one, and the investment options are much wider. 
Diversify, Diversify, Diversify 

As with all investment, diversification and asset allocation are key in retirement planning. Stavis, Margolis Advisory's Samuels said his firm has been dealing with diversity issues in 401(k) accounts long before Enron collapsed. 
The Houston firm often works with employees of area technology companies such as Compaq Computer Corp. (CPQ) and Dell Computer Corp. (DELL), many of whom had to extend their working life because their retirement savings weren't diversified. 
Samuels' clients were often given company shares, but many people also continued to buy additional shares on their own, he said. His clients weren't barred from selling their stock early like Enron workers were, but they still saw their retirement plans blow up in smoke when the tech bubble burst in March 2000. 
""It's psychological,"" he said. ""Everybody wants to be part of a team. And when you have a team that is on the front lines,"" it's easy to get caught up, he said. 
And when it's not one stock that investors load up on, it's one type of stock, financial advisers said. Getting people to diversify away from pure technology holdings, for example, has been an ongoing battle, they added. 
It's a wider problem than most people think. Of 219 401(k) plans studied by the research firm IOMA, 25 had more than 60% of their assets ""wrapped up"" in company stock. In fact, Enron's plan holdings - where 57% were invested in its own stock - might be considered well-diversified compared with those at big firms such as Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), Sherwin-Williams Co. (SHW) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT), where company stock makes up more than 90% of each plan's assets, according to the IOMA survey. 
One area where legislation might help is in encouraging companies to offer investment advice to their employees. Currently, most 401(k) plan participants go it alone when investing because plan sponsors are fearful of liability for advice that leads to losses. 
The Enron case was a disaster, but it could have a silver lining, said Samuels. ""It will be very good for people to pay attention to their retirement, and to realize that diversification is not just a word financial professionals throw around.""

Former Enron Exec Quits As Top Texas Utility Regulator

01/18/2002

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

AUSTIN, Texas (AP)--Texas' top utility regulator, a former Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) executive whose boss donated money to Gov. Rick Perry after the appointment, has quit amid congressional investigations about the company's financial meltdown. 
Max Yzaguirre, formerly president of Houston-based Enron's operations in Mexico, told the Public Utility Commission staff that his resignation was effective Friday, PUC spokesman Terry Hadley said.
Yzaguirre wasn't available for comment but was expected to issue a statement later Friday. 
Yzaguirre told the Republican governor Thursday he was resigning after weeks of turmoil over his selection, The Dallas Morning News reported Friday. 
Sources familiar with the decision told the newspaper on condition of anonymity that Yzaguirre's appointment as chairman of the three-member commission had become a political liability and would continue to be raised by opponents trying to damage Perry's election effort. His term was due to end in 2005. 
Perry, who became governor when President Bush resigned, is running this year for a full term as governor. 
The governor's office didn't immediately return telephone calls from The Associated Press on Friday. 
Since his appointment in June, Yzaguirre led the agency in its move to deregulate the electricity market, an area of great interest to Enron. State lawmakers approved the electric deregulation bill in 1999. 
State Rep. Steve Wolens, D-Dallas, who co-sponsored legislation that opened the utility market on Jan. 1, said Yzaguirre's resignation should not affect the state's newly deregulated electric market. 
""The issue of electric deregulation is beyond any one person,"" Wolens said.

"Bammel Working Gas Sale To AEP","As of today May 9, 2001 Bammel has working gas of approximately 20.3 TBTU.  Economics are favorable to keep injecting.  I estimate that injections will average around 1TBTU per week through May 31, 2001 which would result in another 3+ TBTU beibng injected.  At the current pricing level this means that AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million.  Is this something Accounting should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001?  Should AEP be notified of the volume and approximate value.  Is there anything that needs to be done contractually other than the original agrrement to facilitate this transaction?  I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware!  Please let me know your thoughts.

Subject:	Government Affairs Support for ENA

To better support Enron North America, the following clarifies the roles and responsibilities within Government Affairs.

?	Christi Nicolay will assume a Lead Coordinator role for all power and natural gas matters throughout the country.  In her new position, Christi will have responsibility to ensure that our advocacy (including RTO development) is consistent with Enron's broad interests.  Christi has spent the last 4 years providing day-to-day coverage for EPMI's East Power desk.  Prior to that, Christi worked for FGT and Bracewell & Patterson on natural gas matters.  Please join me in congratulating her on this important role.
?	Because our support for pro-competitive natural gas policies is critical for the continued success of ENA, Leslie Lawner and Rebecca Cantrell will lead ENA's advocacy on natural gas issues working with Christi Nicolay.  Donna Fulton will coordinate our natural gas efforts before FERC.  In addition, the Regional Government Affairs teams will support all state level natural gas matters before the appropriate PUC.  The primary contacts are (1) Steve Montovano - Atlantic Seaboard, (2) Roy Boston - Mid-continent, (3) Jean Ryall - Texas, (4) Jeff Dasovich - California, (5) Paul Kaufman - Other Western States.  
?	Sarah Novosel will continue to coordinate our Northeast power pool activity.  Ray Alvarez will coordinate FERC matters involving Western power matters, including California.  Donna Fulton will coordinate FERC matters in the Eastern power markets. 
?	Charles Yeung and Richard Ingersoll continue to represent Enron before NERC.  In addition, Andy Rodriquez has recently joined our NERC team.
?	Dave Perrino has recently joined Steve Walton's group from the Automated Power Exchange (APX).  Also, Susan Scott will replace Christi Nicolay in supporting the EPMI East Power desk.  Susan was previously working at ET&S supporting Transwestern.  Please join me in welcoming Andy, Dave and Susan to the team. 
?	We have aligned our personnel to ensure effective coverage.  For a detailed listing of Functional Team responsibilities, please see the attached chart.

FBI arrives at Enron offices; company posts guards over records

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. invited the FBI to its headquarters after a former executive said she saw employees shredding documents as recently as last week. Meanwhile, shareholders suing the once-mighty energy company sought access to its former auditor's records. 
FBI agents arrived at Enron's headquarters Tuesday to investigate the shredding allegations and company guards blocked employee access to accounting and finance offices on the 19th and 20th floors of the 50-story building.
""The company has done everything you'd expect under these circumstances,"" Enron attorney Kenneth Marks told U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon. 
The FBI declined to comment, but Enron officials said the agents were on hand to talk with workers and check into the claims. 
On Wednesday, Harmon awaited a plan from shareholders' attorneys to bar auditing firm Arthur Andersen from any further shredding of documents related to Enron's audits. 
One of those attorneys, William Lerach, said multiple lawyers agreed that they want Harmon to approve a plan allowing them to inspect all of Andersen's Enron-related documents and take depositions from top Andersen personnel. They also want Harmon to eliminate any Andersen policies that require document destruction after keeping records for a certain amount of time. 
Andersen already is under a Texas court order prohibiting such shredding. 
Late Tuesday, the proposed restraining order was hammered out by more than a dozen lawyers representing scores of plaintiffs.

FBI Probe Of Enron Begins in Houston; Firm Calls Agency After Allegations Of Data Shredding

HOUSTON, Jan. 22 -- FBI agents descended on Enron's corporate headquarters today to begin investigating document shredding at the bankrupt energy trader. 
The federal investigators were called in by Enron Corp. officials who rushed to the 19th floor of the company's office tower Monday night after being told that documents had been destroyed after the government began inquiring into the company's collapse in October.
Enron attorney Kenneth Marks said at a court hearing today that the Enron officials who visited headquarters Monday night found a trash can containing ""shredded material,"" which was ""immediately secured."" The officials sealed off the 19th and 20th floors pending the FBI's arrival, he said. 
The Justice Department already is investigating the shredding of documents at Enron's accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, which led last week to the firing of the accounting firm's lead Enron auditor, David B. Duncan. 
And the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced today that it will issue subpoenas Wednesday ordering Duncan; Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's chief executive; and two other Andersen officials, attorney Nancy Temple and risk manager Michael Odom, to appear to testify at a hearing Thursday on the Andersen shredding. Andersen signed off on Enron financial statements, whose correction last fall triggered the spiral into bankruptcy. 
Committee spokesman Ken Johnson said it is likely Duncan will invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and not testify. Robert Giuffra, Duncan's attorney, said, ""No final decision has been made"" on whether his client will testify. 
Marks said that when Enron officials found the shredded documents, he immediately called Leslie Ragon Caldwell, head of the federal task force conducting a criminal investigation of Enron. Caldwell told him, he said, that the FBI would begin interviewing Enron employees to determine what was shredded, when and why. 
Marks said that after the Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating the company in October, Enron employees worldwide were told not to destroy records. ""Until [Monday], the company believed that process was working,"" he said. 
The Enron attorney said the documents may have been unrelated to the company's collapse, and there may be ""a completely innocent explanation"" for the shredding. ""There will be an extensive investigation coordinated under the auspices of the Justice Department,"" he said. 
""The FBI was supposed to have a presence there to assess the situation, to look at the volume of what we're dealing with,"" said a Justice Department official late today. He said agents have not yet taken steps to secure documents because ""we need to get a handle on what we're dealing with first."" 
The Enron shredding allegations, first disclosed by ABC News, were made by former Enron project manager Maureen Castenada. She said documents from all over the company were brought to the 19th floor, which housed accountants -- including some from outside auditor Arthur Andersen -- along with payroll operations and a risk management group. 
William Lerach, an attorney for one group suing Enron officials and Andersen, brought a box overflowing with shredded paper to a hearing before U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon. Visible on the shredded documents were references to two partnerships, Jedi II and Raptor, that are at the center of the widening investigations of Enron's collapse. 
The judge is presiding over a string of lawsuits by shareholders and employees who lost billions of dollars as Enron's stock price dropped precipitously after disclosures that the company had overstated its profits for four years. The stock has stayed under $1 since the company filed for bankruptcy protection last month. 
Lawyers for Duncan, the fired Enron auditor, had asked the House committee to postpone his scheduled Thursday appearance, saying he has not had time to review his records or Enron's work papers. 
Duncan didn't want to appear, and though he is likely to invoke the Fifth Amendment, Johnson said, committee investigators think there are many questions he would be able to answer. 
""Duncan provided a great deal of information to investigators, and we believe he can provide lots of answers without pleading the Fifth,"" Johnson said. ""We want him to repeat as much as possible under oath."" 
Last week, SEC and Justice Department prosecutors had two lengthy interviews with Duncan concerning the document destruction. He is cooperating with their probes, his attorney said. 
Attorneys for Odom and Temple told the committee that they would welcome a subpoena because it would help shield them from lawsuits from their former client, Enron, Johnson said. Without a subpoena, they worried that Enron could sue them for disclosing confidential information about the company, he said. 
He said Berardino's attorneys told him the Andersen chief executive would prefer to appear in a week or so, when Andersen has had more time to sift through the facts surrounding its relationship with Enron and the circumstances surrounding Andersen's shredding of Enron-related documents. 
But the committee feels comfortable compelling Berardino or a knowledgeable surrogate to appear to at least brief the committee on what he and other top Andersen officials know so far, Johnson said. 
Johnson said some potential witnesses have asked the committee for immunity for their testimony, but it has not been offered. He said panel investigators are in daily contact with the Justice Department and that any offer of congressional immunity would have to be coordinated with federal prosecutors. 
Congressional immunity has made the job of prosecutors more difficult in the past. Providing immunized testimony to Congress can help a witness later defend against criminal charges. Courts have ruled that prosecutors must show they had incriminating evidence before the witness disclosed it in an immunized setting. 
Also today, one of the accounting industry's private-sector oversight authorities announced that it will disband in response to SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt's proposal, in the wake of Andersen's apparent role in the Enron collapse, to revamp regulation of the profession. 
The members of the Public Oversight Board, which is funded by the accounting industry, decided to resign because it was clear Pitt's plans ""do not include a place for the POB,"" board Chairman Charles A. Bowsher wrote in a letter to Pitt. The POB members also complained that Pitt didn't consult them. 
Bowsher said in an interview that Pitt's plan was little more than ""rearranging the chairs on the deck."" He added, ""It looks like he [Pitt] just really was consulting the Big Five [accounting] firms and the AICPA,"" a reference to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
Pitt wrote back urging the POB to reconsider. Pitt said he intended ""to strengthen the body that will be our 'new' POB, insure its independence from the AICPA and expand its mandate.""

Enron Creditor Asks Court To Force Co To Save Documents
By Kathy Chu

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This story was published late Tuesday) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- An Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) creditor is petitioning a federal judge to order the bankrupt company to preserve all of its financial documents.
The move follows allegations by at least three former Enron employees in the past 24 hours that the bankrupt company shredded documents even after federal investigators began a probe into possible accounting irregularities. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reportedly found shredded paper in a trash can at the company's Houston headquarters. 
In a court filing late Tuesday, the Florida State Board of Administration - a pension fund that lost about $334 million in Enron-related investments - said that the bankrupt company's ""purported"" destruction of documents ""raises serious issues concerning Enron's ability and willingness to satisfy its fiduciary obligations to creditors"" and to equity holders. 
Creditors will be ""irreparably"" harmed by Enron's further destruction of documents connected to the company's relationship with its auditor, Arthur Andersen, according to the pension fund. Arthur Andersen has also come under fire recently for admitting to the disposal of Enron-related paperwork. 
Enron, in a statement late Monday, said that it had issued four e-mails from Oct. 25 to Jan. 14, warning employees against destroying papers related to the company's financial condition or its web of partnerships. 
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, is scheduled to hear the motion Feb. 5.

Shredding over the years: paper strips, confetti cuts for cause

WASHINGTON (AP) - G. Gordon Liddy remembers ""shredding stuff left and right"" after the Watergate break-in. 
Oliver North says he fired up a shredder within earshot of top Justice officials as they pored over Iran-Contra documents.
Now comes the image of Enron employees furiously shredding on Christmas Day. 
Inside government and out, when there's a whiff of trouble, the impulse to shred is powerful. 
""There is an almost instinctive urge to try to cover one's trail,"" said Steve Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. 
That urge often leads to more trouble, feeding perceptions of guilt and raising questions about obstruction of justice. 
Three decades after Watergate, people still speculate about what might have been spoken on the mysterious 18 1/2 -minute gap in President Nixon's White House tapes. 
In the case of Enron, lawyers for investors say the company began shredding hundreds of thousands of documents last fall after the Securities and Exchange Commission announced it was investigating the company's finances. The alleged shredding went on seven days a week - even on Christmas, they claim. 
Enron says it had a strict anti-shredding policy in place. Enron-related papers also were destroyed by the Houston office of accounting firm Arthur Andersen. 
New York University law professor Stephen Gillers says a lawyer's first advice to someone facing investigation ought to be ""freeze."" 
""Nothing gets destroyed that is in any way connected with the subject of the proceeding,"" he said. 
Oh, the intrigues America might have missed had such advice always been given and heeded. 
Liddy, who planned the 1972 Watergate break-in, later told of hunting around his office for a higher-capacity shredder the next morning because a small one was too slow. ""I was shredding stuff left and right,"" he said last year. 
North testified during the Iran-Contra hearings in 1987 that he was shredding documents even as Justice officials were reviewing papers in his office. ""They could hear it,"" he said. ""The shredder was right outside the door."" 
His secretary, Fawn Hall, testified that she and North fed a foot-and-a-half-tall stack of memos into the shredder one day, dumping in so much stuff that the machine jammed. 
Nowadays, with the increasing use of e-mail and other electronic documents, it's easier than ever to destroy evidence - and harder than ever. 
""One can certainly delete an enormous amount of electronic information at the push of a button,"" said Aftergood. But, he added, electronic records also leave footprints that can often be recovered. 
Government investigators are now making a new effort to retrieve the lost words from that 18 1/2 -minute gap. 
Nixon came to regret that he hadn't destroyed the audiotapes outright. 
""The fat was in the fire,"" wrote Leonard Garment, who worked in the Nixon White House. ""To Nixon's everlasting regret, the tapes were not.""

Enron Unit Creditors Asking For Naming Trustee, Examiner
By Kathy Chu

01/23/2002
Dow Jones News Service

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
(This was originally published late Tuesday.) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) has done little in the past year to inspire confidence in its finances.
That's why it may come as no surprise that some Enron creditors - in the latest challenge to a company struggling to reorganize - are petitioning a federal judge to appoint an independent trustee or an examiner in the largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history. 
Late Tuesday, a half-dozen energy concerns led by Wiser Oil Co. (WZR) filed a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, asking that a trustee or an examiner be named for Enron North America - the unit containing much of the parent company's energy-trading assets. 
If the request is approved, Enron's reorganization efforts may be significantly delayed, according to legal experts. 
Examiners are charged with investigating certain aspects of a company's finances or operations, while a trustee would take over the company's daily operations. 
It's unlikely that a trustee will be named due to the complex nature of Enron's business and the disruption of this move on the ongoing Chapter 11 proceedings, according to bankruptcy experts, and even an examiner could be a long shot. 
But all bets may be off if investigators determine that Enron destroyed documents related to its financial condition. 
Nancy Rapoport, dean of law at the University of Houston, said that the ""likelihood"" of having an examiner appointed would dramatically increase if the allegations of three former Enron employees - who allege that the company shredded documents even after federal investigators began a probe into possible accounting irregularities - prove true. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is currently looking into the matter. 
The decision of whether an examiner is warranted will also depend on evidence presented at the hearing, according to Jack Williams, the outgoing scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute, a nonprofit think tank in Alexandria, Va. 
""If creditors start to develop some smoking gun showing management misconduct, that will resonate with the judge,"" he said. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer noted that most of the creditors asking for appointment of an independent trustee or examiner are former competitors of Enron's energy-trading operations. 
""I think you have to consider that they just might not want to compete with a former competitor,"" he said. 
Enron stakeholders are best served by ""a going concern,"" Palmer added, not by a company that is liquidated - as possible move if a trustee takes over. 
A hearing before federal Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez is scheduled for Feb. 20.

Andersen execs getting subpoenas, FBI checking shredding report

WASHINGTON (AP) - Senior officials of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm are receiving subpoenas to compel them to testify to Congress about the massive destruction of Enron-related documents. 
Enron's own alleged shredding, meanwhile, is being investigated by FBI agents at the bankrupt energy company's Houston headquarters.
Subpoenas are going to Andersen chief executive Joseph Berardino, fired auditor David Duncan, attorney Nancy Temple and risk manager Michael Odom for their testimony at a House hearing Thursday. 
""No one's getting a free pass on this one,"" Ken Johnson, spokesman for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said Tuesday. 
In a sprawling inquiry with both financial and political overtones, 11 House and Senate committees are investigating the Enron debacle, while the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission pursue their own less visible probes. 
Enron's slide into the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2 left thousands of employees out of work and stripped of their retirement savings after Enron temporarily barred them from selling company stock from their Enron-dominated 401(k) accounts. Investors around the country were burned.

US Treasury Secy: Task Force On Enron To Report Soon

TOKYO (AP)--U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said Wednesday the task force he heads on the collapse of energy giant Enron (ENRNQ) could reach initial recommendations as early as Thursday. 
Speaking to reporters after a Tokyo conference on Afghan reconstruction Wednesday, O'Neill said he would speak with Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao Thursday morning to discuss findings of the task force.
President George W. Bush directed O'Neill to see if current laws need to be strengthened to better protect small investors from substantial losses, like those suffered by thousands of former Enron employees. 
""The President's intention is that we see if there are lessons we should learn from the Enron experience to better protect individual employees and individual shareholders in situations like this,"" O'Neill said. 
He suggested that the recommendations might be solidified during Thursday's telephone call and said they would be delivered to Bush in the ""very near future."" 
Another Enron-related task force looking at company disclosure rules is likely to make similar recommendations later, O'Neill added.

Enron's In-House Security Team To Leave, Form Private Co

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON (AP)--Enron's (ENRNQ) top security team - an in-house agency that protected executives and sniffed out employee misconduct - is leaving the company to form a private consulting firm. 
An Enron spokesman said Tuesday the move is unrelated to accusations that Enron executives hid financial problems from investors and that employees shredded documents after the company filed for bankruptcy.
The new firm, Secure Solutions International, will continue security work for Enron through a consulting contract, spokesman Vance Meyer said. 
After Enron filed for bankruptcy, the security officers faced the possibility of being laid off and began to consider forming an independent firm, Meyer told the Houston Chronicle in Wednesday's editions. 
John W. Presley, a former FBI agent who was Enron's director of corporate security and will lead the new firm, could not be reached by The Associated Press for comment Wednesday. Neither Presley nor the security firm he is developing has a listed number. 
The team also includes four former CIA officers and a former investigator for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. 
Andre Le Gallo, a business intelligence consultant in California, said the former agents' switch to private consulting is not unusual in the security industry, especially in light of Enron's collapse. 
""I'm sure they moved because they found better things to do than (stay) at a sinking firm,"" he said.

Accounting Oversight Board To Disband By March 31

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
(This report was first published late Tuesday.) 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The Public Oversight Board - the only independent check on U.S. accounting firms - has voted to disband by March 31.
""This decision was made reluctantly, but members of the board felt we had no other recourse,"" POB Chairman Charles Bowsher said in a Jan. 21 letter to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt. 
Following the collapse of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ), Pitt last week announced plans to create a new self-regulatory organization to oversee accounting and audit firms. 
Pitt made it clear that his plans ""do not include a place for the POB,"" Bowsher added. 
""It is significant that there was no consultation with the POB before these proposed changes were announced,"" Bowsher continued. 
POB members learned of the changes from accounting industry professionals and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants officials who ""apparently had been in talks with you on this matter for some time,"" Bowsher noted. 
Bowsher said the POB will work with the SEC to ensure a reasonable transition by March 31. 
An SEC spokesman was not immediately available to comment on the POB's letter.

Bush Says Handling of Enron Case Was Proper

BELLE, W.Va., Jan 22 -- Just before a new round of congressional hearings into the collapse of Enron Corp., President Bush today portrayed his own family as a victim of the energy company's failure and said his administration had handled its contacts with desperate Enron executives exactly right. 
""What I'm outraged about is that shareholders and employees didn't know all the facts about Enron,"" Bush said. ""My own mother-in-law bought stock last summer, and it's not worth anything now. If she had known all the facts, I don't know what decision would have been made, but she didn't know all the facts. And a lot of shareholders didn't know all the facts. And that's wrong.""
Bush's comments, made while he toured a Caterpillar dealership here, marked the first time he has directly addressed the Enron debacle since it began dominating the news nearly two weeks ago. With daily disclosures about White House ties to the Texas energy giant threatening to drown out Bush's agenda, the president offered a vigorous defense of his administration's conduct, and sought to align himself with the thousands of Enron shareholders left with worthless stock. 
The president said the government must crack down on accounting practices that allowed Enron to hide the magnitude of its debt, and he repeated his call for full corporate disclosure to protect stockholders. 
The White House said the first lady's mother, Jenna Welch, bought 200 shares of Enron at $40.90 a share on Sept. 21, 1999, and sold them all for 42 cents a share on Dec. 4, two days after the bankruptcy filing. That was a loss of $8,096. 
Bush made a preemptive strike against the upcoming Capitol Hill investigations of Enron, several of which are likely to explore his administration's treatment of major donors, including Enron executives. ""The Congress also needs to stay focused on the American people,"" Bush said. ""We're running a war. We've got to make sure our homeland is secure, and we've got to make sure people can find work. And we'll take care of our business."" 
The new wave of hearings will begin on Thursday and will likely last months. ""I'm confident that all the facts will come out on Enron,"" Bush said. ""And I'm also confident that if Congress has the right attitude, we can get a lot done."" 
White House officials, who had said that the public was paying little attention to the matter, were stunned last week by a CBS News poll in which 63 percent of the respondents said they thought Bush officials were not disclosing everything they knew about the administration's relationship with Enron. 
The White House announced on Jan. 10 that Enron's chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, had contacted Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans shortly before he disclosed massive losses that set off a death spiral for the stock price of Enron, which in December filed the largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history. 
Today, Bush was asked whether he was worried that the Enron case is creating a negative perception about him or his policies. ""Our administration has done the exact right thing,"" he said. ""There has been a couple of contacts with people in my Cabinet. And my Cabinet officers said: 'No help here.' "" 
Bush pointed to an investigation of the handling of Enron employees' pension funds that was begun by the Labor Department ""before anybody started paying attention to Enron."" The investigation was announced three days after Enron's bankruptcy filing. 
""I'm absolutely confident the American people know that my administration has acted the right way,"" Bush said. ""Our government must do something about it -- must make sure that the accounting practices that have been going on for quite a while are addressed, make sure there's full disclosure and the corporate governance issues are wide open for everybody to understand."" 
Vice President Cheney has refused to release to Congress the list of people who were consulted in crafting Bush's energy policy last year, although his office has said that he and his aides met with Enron representatives six times. Bush was asked today if he would release the information as a start toward putting the matter behind him. 
""If somebody has got an accusation about some wrongdoing, just let me know,"" Bush said. ""It's like when I talked with Don Evans and O'Neill. They told me they had spoke to Enron. I said: 'Tell the people what you did.' And if there's any accusations, if you've got anything on your mind, the energy report should speak for itself. We laid out the energy report. It's fully disclosed."" 
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters on Air Force One that he has learned of no new contacts between Enron executives and administration officials about the company's finances. 
""Remember, on contacts, what I've always said is, I've done my best to answer questions about any contacts with Enron about Enron's financial condition or anything of that nature,"" Fleischer said. ""I've always said there may be contacts with Enron about other topics.""

USA: US Congress returns to Enron, recession, politics.
By Thomas Ferraro

01/23/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers return on Wednesday for the second and final year of the 107th Congress with the Enron scandal, the recession and the upcoming November elections crowding center stage. 
In an effort to get off to a good bipartisan start, leaders of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives planned to meet with President George W. Bush at the White House shortly before their chambers were to convene at midday.
Aides said the leaders intended to discuss often conflicting legislative priorities, which have basically come down to Republican support for tax cuts versus Democratic calls for increased spending. 
Wright Andrews, a veteran Capitol Hill lobbyist, predicted ""only a limited number of things will get done"" during the year largely because of the pivotal congressional races in the fall that will determine control of both houses. 
Andrews said he expected some progress would be made on bolstering national defense in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. 
Chuck Gabriel, an analyst with Prudential Securities, also saw Republicans and Democrats finding little common ground on other than security issues. 
""The election will permeate every decision made in Congress this year,"" Gabriel said, predicting the parties would jockey on most other issues, from energy and health care to economic and farm policy. 
A third of the Democratic-led Senate and the entire Republican-controlled House will be up for election in November. 
Before voters go to the polls, Congress is expected to send to Bush to sign into law legislation to revamp the U.S. election system in an effort to avoid a repeat of the disputed 2000 White House election. 
""I can't think of a higher priority,"" said Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat and a possible 2004 presidential contender. 
At least eight congressional committees also plan to examine the dealings of Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy giant and a major political contributor to both parties that collapsed last year in the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, wiping out the savings of many workers. 
Enron's aggressive and murky bookkeeping practices are under heavy scrutiny by investigators and the proceedings are expected to spawn fresh efforts for campaign, pension and regulatory reform. 
It remains to be seen, however, what Democrats and Republicans will be able to agree to. 
John Coffee, a Columbia University Law School professor, said he was expecting ""a legislative perfect storm."" 
Congressional grandstanding was also certain to be a factor but financial experts felt a thorough airing of the Enron affair was necessary. 
""It's going to be overdone, but let's face it - a lot of people lost a lot of money,"" said Michael Bradley, professor of finance at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. 
""We ought to prosecute the evil-doers,"" Bradley added. ""This scrutiny is good."" 
Daschle hoped to use the White House meeting with Bush to push a new plan to break an impasse over an economic stimulus package intended to spur the U.S. economy out of a recession that began last spring. 
In a letter to Bush on Tuesday, Daschle proposed Congress enact a scaled-back package of employment and tax provisions with 13 weeks of extended unemployment benefits, tax rebates for those who did not receive one in last year's $1.35 trillion tax cut, a bonus depreciation for business computers and other equipment and financial aid for cash-strapped states. 
""Because it is so important to get our economy growing again, I propose to put before the Senate a package of noncontroversial economic provisions,"" Daschle said. 
Bush has made an economic stimulus plan a top priority, citing a continuing need to bolster the economy further shaken by the attacks in New York and Washington. 
Though the president has blamed Senate Democrats for failing to bring a Republican-backed plan to a vote last year, the White House reacted carefully to Daschle's proposal. 
""The president has been working on a bipartisan approach and he believes it is important for the Senate to pass a comprehensive economic package that encourages job growth and provides unemployment assistance for workers who have lost jobs,"" said spokesman Scott McClellan. 
Daschle's proposal would cost the federal treasury $69 billion this year and $7 billion next year, far less than the more sweeping multiyear stimulus plan backed by Bush and congressional Republicans.

Editorial
Campaign Finance After Enron

01/23/2002
The Washington Post
FINAL
A16
Copyright 2002, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

AS CONGRESS resumes business today, it has a chance to act immediately on one aspect of the Enron scandal. That aspect is campaign finance. The existing system of soft-money donations allowed Enron to buy access to the administration and Congress. Although it is not clear yet whether this access corrupted the policy of the Bush administration, it appears likely that it did corrupt Congress in the late 1990s, contributing to a misguided decision not to regulate the financial instruments that triggered Enron's bankruptcy. Moreover, the soft-money system has allowed Enron's auditor and the other big accounting firms to sway Congress on the issue of audit regulation, contributing to the lax standards that made the Enron scandal possible. Now that thousands of Enron employees have lost their jobs and in some cases their retirement savings, there is no excuse for further delay in banning soft money. 
It is true that the Bush administration refused to help Enron stave off bankruptcy. But those who suggest this exonerates the existing campaign finance system have a steep hill to climb. Enron and its officers would not have donated $1.7 million in the 2000 election cycle -- 70 percent of which came in the form of soft money -- if they thought they would get nothing in exchange. Even the suspicion that the money bought something is enough to corrode public trust in the political system. The fact that some members of Congress are now returning money received from Enron underlines the damage that soft money can do to politicans' standing.
But the larger point is that the Bush administration's indifference to Enron's final pleas may have been the exception. Enron's money may well have played a role in persuading the administration, in the form of no less a person than Vice President Dick Cheney, to intervene on its behalf with an Indian leader. It may have made a difference to the White House's energy policy. And it almost certainly bought sympathy in Congress. In 1998 the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates derivatives, suggested that there should be oversight for the kinds of ""over-the-counter"" instruments that Enron trades. But Congress buried the proposal, apparently because Enron and other industry participants did not want to be regulated. 
Then there are the Big Five auditing companies, all of which featured among the top 20 contributors to the Bush campaign, and all of which have showered money on Congress. On three occasions in the 1990s Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, tried to tighten regulation of auditors. Each time the industry persuaded Congress to squelch his ideas. In one fight, in which Mr. Levitt tried to prevent auditors from limiting their legal liability, the industry even persuaded Congress to overturn the president's veto. If the auditors' soft-dollar contributions had been limited, and if their sway over Congress had been diluted, it is conceivable that the rules governing auditors would now be more robust. 
The Enron scandal raises other issues that will take months to resolve. But the work on campaign finance is fairly advanced already. The Senate has passed a good bill, and reformers are organizing a petition to force a vote in the House over the objections of the Republican leadership. It would be extraordinary, in the face of Enron, if Congress failed to act now.

Federal Judicial Nominee To Face Questions About Enron

01/23/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

DALLAS (AP)--Political contributions from Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) will prompt the U.S. Senate to examine Texas Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen's dealings with the troubled energy trader when her nomination to a federal appeals court is considered, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman says. 
Bush has tapped Owen to become a member of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. She has been awaiting Senate confirmation.
""The Senate will look at Justice Owen's Enron rulings as part of her overall record,"" Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., told The Dallas Morning News in Wednesday's editions. ""She has a right to take contributions, but any judge -liberal or conservative -faces the legitimate question about whether a contribution influenced their thinking."" 
Owen, a Republican, was the author of a unanimous Texas Supreme Court opinion in 1996 that settled a tax issue in Enron's favor, rejecting the Spring Independent School District's argument that the Enron natural gas inventory should be assessed at a value $15 million higher than stated by the company. 
That decision spared Enron $225,000 in taxes. It came two years after Owen accepted $8,600 in Enron contributions, according to Texans for Public Justice. The nonprofit group tracks campaign spending. 
Owen has not fielded questions regarding the Enron contribution or her judicial decisions. 
""She will have a very, very tough road ahead,"" said Nan Aron, president of the Alliance for Justice, which calls Owen and other Bush judicial nominees too extreme.

India Dabhol Pwr To Explain Equipment Transfer To Customs

01/23/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Dabhol Power Co., the Indian unit of the collapsed U.S. energy trader Enron Corp. (ENE), said Wednesday it has been asked by the customs department to explain why it had moved imported components from its project site. 
The components were covered by concessional duties on the condition that these would be used for the DPC joint venture project.
""It's true that DPC has received a notice from the customs department. We'll reply to them shortly,"" said Jimmy Mogal, a spokesman for DPC. 
Earlier Wednesday, the Press Trust Of India news agency reported that DPC had received a notice from the customs department on the matter. 
According to the report, DPC said it had shifted some critical components from its 2,184-megawatt power plant located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra to a secured location to prevent vandalism and pilferage at its 1,700 acre site. 
""...if a certain portion of the equipment are shifted from the site, they no longer are entitled to concession and attract heavy duty,"" the report quoted Customs Commissioner S.D. Majumdar as saying. 
Majumdar said that in a letter to the managing director of DPC, K. Wade Cline, Jan. 14, the department had sought clarification within five days. 
Some $2.9 billion have been invested in the Dabhol plant which has a debt-to-equity ratio of 2 to 1. 
Enron holds a 65% stake in Dabhol, while General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Corp. (X.BTL) own 10% each. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board owns the remaining 15%. 
Enron, which is under investigation in the U.S. for allegedly trying to conceal massive losses, wants to sell its unit in India due to disputes with its sole buyer - the Maharashtra State Electricity Board - and with the federal government over payment guarantees. 
Dabhol plant is the single largest foreign investment in India to date.

E-chips are still in India, says Enron.

01/23/2002
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2002 The Times of India

MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday was informed by the beleaguered Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) that certain imported electronic chips and coded compact discs (CDs), alleged to have been sent out of India, are very much in the country. Senior counsel Janak Dwarkadas said that if necessary the e-chips and coded CDs could be placed in the safe custody of the court or with Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) to whom the chips are mortgaged. 
The court, which directed DPC to serve a notice to IDBI asking its representatives to be present at the next hearing, has adjourned to Thursday the decision on the custody of the e-chips.
Significantly, advocate general Goolam Vahanvati, representing Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), pointed out that assistant customs commissioner, Dapoli, had issued a notice on January 16 to DPC managing director K. Wade Cline to verify within five days a news report regarding the alleged removal of certain imported equipment, including the e-chips, from the company's site. The customs department had directed DPC to ""provide details of the equipment so removed and their present place of storage"" if indeed equipment was moved. 
In his report to DPC, S.B. Kamath, assistant commissioner, customs division, Dapoli, had written that ""you are well aware that equipment and machinery meant for power project at Dabhol were extended concessional power project rate of duty on condition that these are to be used for initial setting up of the power project."" He noted that if certain portion of the imported equipments were not used for the power project and removed from the project site, those equipment become dis-entitled for concessions in customs duty. 
The customs officer had observed that unless the removal of the imported goods was sanctioned by the ""proper officer"", they would be ""liable to confiscation."" 
The court was hearing the petition filed by DPC challenging the jurisdiction of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission's (MERC) to debar the company from proceeding with international arbitration against MSEB. Mr Vahanvati told the court that DPC allegedly moved 70 crates of important documents out of India ever since the litigation started in May 2001. He said DPC ought to give details of the documents. The MSEB's stand in the matter is that DPC has indulged in ""misrepresentation"".

BG Group Says Has Revised Agreement To Buy Enron India

01/23/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Oil and gas exploration company BG Group PLC (BRG) said Wednesday that it has renegotiated the price of Enron Oil and Gas India Limited down to $350 million. 
The company originally agreed to pay $388 million to Enron Corp. Inc (ENE) in October. However, work to close the transaction was complicated by Enron's recent filing for bankruptcy.
BG said the original purchase agreement expired in December, but was renegotiated to take account of Enron's current position. 
""This revised agreement secures strong producing fields at a price that is attractive to both BG Group's shareholders and Enron's creditors,"" said Frank Chapman, chief executive of BG Group. 
BG said the revised agreement has been reviewed by Enron's creditors. The troubled U.S. energy company now needs to ask for approval for the sale from the Bankruptcy Court. The deal is expected to be completed by mid-February, BG said. 
The agreement could be an important one for BG because India's gas market is growing fast. The subcontinent's gas supply deficit is projected to grow to around 248 million standard cubic meters/day by 2012 from an estimated 86 million this year.

STOCKWATCH - BG gains after agreeing cheaper price for Enron's Indian assets

01/23/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

LONDON (AFX) - BG Group PLC shares gained ground in late morning trade, after the company announced it had agreed a lower price for bankrupt Enron Corp's upstream oil and gas assets in India, dealers said. 
BG had said in October that it would pay 388 mln usd for the two producing gas and oil fields where production can be increased significantly.
But the deal met obstacles with Enron filing for Chapter 11 protection and because Enron's Indian partners, ONGC and Reliance Industries, were reluctant to give BG operatorship. 
The new deal, announced today, is for a lower price of 350 mln usd and is no longer conditional on BG gaining operatorship. 
While analysts are pleased at the price -- much lower than ABN Amro's valuation of the assets at 435 mln usd, for example -- there is some caution about the question marks over the operatorship. 
""The only downside would be if an Indian operator could not move the project ahead as quickly as BG would like and there may be speculation about the change of heart on the issue of operatorship,"" said ABN Amro in a note. 
While the acquisition has minimal impact on BG's earnings it does prove once again that the group is able to grow its business. 
ABN Amro repeated its 'buy' recommendation, saying the group still offers the most attractive growth story among European oils. 
At 11.45 am, BG's shares were 3-1/4 pence higher at 280-3/4 and the FTSE 100 was up 3.1 points at 5,152.1.

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- Collapsed U.S. energy trader Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit, the Dabhol Power Co., confirmed Wednesday an end-March deadline for finalizing the sale of Dabhol's 85% foreign-owned equity. 
""That's what the IFIs (Indian financial institutions) are looking at, subject to us agreeing on the confidentiality agreement and moving forward with the due diligence,"" said DPC spokesman Jimmy Mogal.
According to a report in India's Financial Express Wednesday, India's federal government and domestic lenders have drawn up a ""road map"" for finalizing the sale of the troubled 2,184-megawatt power project by end-March. 
Domestic creditors have provided US$1.4 billion of the project's total projected cost of US$2.9 billion. Lead creditor Industrial Development Bank of India's (P.IDB) exposure is in excess of 20 billion rupees (US$1=INR48.2825). 
The government has asked the IDBI to finalize a list of the ""serious buyers"" for the 85% stake - which includes a 65% controlling stake held by Enron - in the DPC ""within the next few days,"" the Financial Express reported. 
General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Corp. (X.BTL) own a 10% stake each. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board owns the remaining 15%. 
Tata Power Co. (P.TPW), BSES Ltd. (P.BSX), Gas Authority of India Ltd. (P.GAI), TotalFina Elf (TOT), Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), and Gaz de France are the prospective bidders for Dabhol's 85% foreign-owned equity. 
As reported Tuesday, TotalFina Elf's India Chief Representative Jean-Claude Breton said bidders may sign the confidentiality agreement with DPC early February.

Furnish details on Enron scam, state urged.

01/23/2002
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2002 The Times of India

MUMBAI: The Mumbai Regional Congress Committee (MRCC) has asked the state government to provide infrastructure to the judicial commission probing the Enron scam. This is necessary to expedite the inquiry into one of the biggest scams in recent times, MRCC president Murli Deora said. 
He said in a press release that while in opposition the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance had promised to drown Enron's Dabhol power project in the Arabian Sea. But after coming to power, the alliance had not only endorsed the first phase of the venture, but even permitted the second phase. The people of Maharashtra are entitled to know the truth behind the sanctioning of the project which has nearly spelt the death knell of the state electricity board, Mr Deora observed.

Enron's failure in Japan clears way for rivals
Edith Terry worked as a policy strategist for Enron from 1998 to 2000 and was involved with the establishment of Enron's Japan venture.

01/23/2002
South China Morning Post

NICHOLAS O'DAY, a former Australian banker who for four months was president of Enron's Japan venture, now sits alone in an office owned by former Enron partner Orix. A worker is removing the white board near his desk. ""Soon I'll be staring out a big empty cavernous floor,"" he says, where as recently as last month, 60 traders plied such exotic wares as weather derivatives and electricity futures. 
The swank office in the Otemachi 1st Square Building in central Tokyo was the nerve centre of Enron's Asian empire, which once sought to marry Enron's trading and risk management expertise with more conventional infrastructure development from China to North Africa. Japan was a test case for Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling, who viewed it as the premier example globally of an advanced economy with under-utilised infrastructure.
Enron was supposed to add value and make money by showing the Japanese how to manage utility prices through introducing derivatives and hedging strategies for short-term contracts for electricity, gas and broadband services, gradually building liquid markets and trading capability. Its popular Japanese Web site was the platform for feisty marketing gambits, such as offering 10 per cent rebates to its Japanese power customers. Enron paid the rebates up-front as ""option fees"" for future power delivery. 
Instead, on January 11, the Houston-based company filed for bankruptcy without having executed a single trade. Elsewhere in Asia, Enron is preparing to sell its remaining assets, which consist of its huge Dabhol power plant in India and smaller-scale power stations in China, Guam and the Philippines. But the Japan story remains as a cautionary tale of Enron's substantial ambition and the even more sizeable obstacles it met in Asia's largest and most moribund economy. 
Unlike Enron's collapse in Houston, the failure of its business venture in Japan was a slow death. The lessons it holds are mundane. In an era of globalisation, there are enough differences between economies that cookie-cutter solutions just do not work. 
When Enron first began scouting the Japanese power market in the late 1990s, the country's big nine electric utilities feared the worst. With its hardball style and deep pockets, Enron seemed like the only foreign company capable of breaking open Japan's US$127 billion electricity market, at a time when the nation's industry was facing pressure from regulators and a decade-long economic slump. 
Japanese media, coached by the utilities, described Enron as a ""black ship"" that would force its way into the market, ending a 50-year regime based on offering subsidised electricity prices for manufacturers and some of the world's highest power prices for residential customers. As with many other aspects of Japan's post-war economic system, the utilities had served a purpose during the country's high-growth period. Now, they worried their cosy domain would be exposed to market forces. 
They need not have feared. Enron's first problem was its business model, which built on its experience in the United States and British markets but failed to reflect the depth of the utilities' cartel. 
In the spring of 1999, Bruce Wrobel, then an executive with New York-based power developer Sithe Energies, went to Mr Skilling with a proposal to set up a joint venture to ""aggregate"" power from ageing and cash-strapped Japanese industrials to sell to large commercial customers as Japanese rules eased. 
Mr Wrobel thought he could stitch together enough wattage from industrial companies with surplus power to sell into the market for customers who could take their power at 20kV or higher, theoretically one-third of total Japanese electricity sales. This segment was due to open to non-utility suppliers in March 2000. 
Mr Skilling agreed to back Mr Wrobel over a three-year period, with an initial US$65 million, after which the Japanese venture, E Power, would go public and the original investors would cash out. 
One problem with the model was that Japanese industrials had power to sell, but only at night, said Masayusu Ishiguro, an expert with Nomura Research Institute and author of several books on Japan's ""electricity revolution"". He argued that even with the recession, most of the excess capacity in the system was useless. Enron was also blackballed by the utilities, which put out the word that they would shut off power to any company that dared to do business with Enron. 
According to Mr O'Day, who became president of E Power in September last year after half the venture's staff was fired, E Power searched the ""length and breadth"" of Japan for potential power sources before changing tack in the middle of last year. From this point on, Enron's plans entered the realm of the surreal. Shut out of supply by both the utilities and the ""behind the fence"" industrial sources of generation, it decided to build its own power stations. 
Over the course of the year, E Power announced four deals for major power stations, worth billions of dollars, aimed at Japan's tentative next stage of deregulation when there was a chance that the government would further enlarge the market by allowing smaller customers to buy power from independent suppliers. Since even Japanese utilities were closing power stations to cope with reduced demand, most of Enron's competitors were mystified. 
When E Power shut in September, it had conducted no business in two years of operation. A separate affiliate, Enron Japan, dropped the idea of electricity trading last year because of difficulties in setting up transactions. Last month, when Enron Japan put its assets up for sale, investors found little of value other than a few of its trading positions, but no one made an offer. 
El Paso Japan president Stephen Del Regno says: ""Enron paid the dues for everybody. Enron was happy to be the first mover. They helped us quite a bit by doing things exactly wrong if you really want to progress a business [in Japan]."" 
El Paso recently was invited by the Japanese Government to take Enron's place as informal foreign adviser on policy and regulatory issues. 
In Japan, Enron's failure has been a setback not only for consumers, who pay prices as much as 81 per cent above the average among advanced industrial countries, but for the concept of open markets in the energy sector. 
""It is certain that it doesn't contribute to our discussion,"" says Akira Kawamoto, an official in charge of energy policy in Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. ""There are those people who will use the collapse of Enron as a sign of the failure of liberalisation."" 
Akiko Murakami, an executive with Marubeni, which also has failed to break into the Japanese power market, said: ""The utilities will use this whole incident as part of their negative campaign. It will be hard for people to invest in the sector. They may lose faith and pull out.""

Laydoff.com gives voice to disgruntled Enron workers

01/23/2002
South China Morning Post

John Allario, one of the thousands of Enron employees to have lost their jobs when the energy firm fell into bankruptcy at the end of last year, is trying to find some dark humour in the unfolding saga. 
Mr Allario, 38, has set up Laydoff.com, a Web site acting as a forum for Enron workers who not only lost their jobs but, in many cases, their life savings.
The site's name is a swipe at Enron's chairman and chief executive Ken Lay, who pocketed millions of US dollars from offloading shares over the past few years. 
The site has had 18,000 hits and Mr Allario has sold almost 500 T-shirts, bearing messages such as ""I got Lay'd by Enron"" and ""My boss got a retention bonus, all I got was this T-shirt"". The best seller is the simple ""Thanks Ken, Jeff and Andy"", referring to the directors held to account by workers for the firm's collapse. 
Mr Allario, who had worked at EnronOnline, had been with the firm for 6.5 years, and has walked away with US$4,500 before tax - about three weeks' pay. Shares he held in his pension plans had been worth US$108,000 at their peak. He sold them for less than US$500. 
""I left feeling pretty angry but that can destroy you, so I'm trying to put it into something positive,"" he said. 
""It's like Of Mice and Men - these guys trawling around the country looking for work and one says to the other, `don't be friendly with your boss - he's not your friend, he's your boss'. I used to work in investment banks and the focus with Enron and Wall Street is making money, and the system stinks."" 
Like other workers, Mr Allario is talking to lawyers about potential action for redress. Fleming & Associates, a Houston-based law firm, is holding a meeting with former employees later this week. 
There is certainly enough anger among former Enron workers to support Mr Allario's Web site. Many employees' pension plans were tied up in Enron stock, the price of which fell from a peak of US$90 to virtually nothing. 
Janis Farmer, a former administrator who retired last year, is a typical example. At the time her stock was worth US$700,000. She sold it for US$20,400. 
""It has become increasingly clear that employees and retirees were sacrificed for their own personal gain,"" she said. ""Enron executives let us down, the auditors let us down, Wall Street analysts let us down and the companies lending the money to Enron let us down. But at the end of the day . . . who has the greatest pain and greatest losses? We do."" 
Another Enron worker, Roger Boyce, had more than US$2 million in Enron stock - now worth about US$3,000. When he wanted to sell as the share price plummeted, he was locked out by the company's management. 
""If we aren't properly informed about what is going on, how can we make intelligent investment decisions? 
""I don't think I was naive. Why wouldn't we believe what the executives were saying and what the Wall Street analysts were saying - that this was a growth company? We had tremendous trust in Enron and this has been betrayed,"" Mr Boyce said. 
One unnamed employee who also lost his job saw the storm coming early last year but did not realise the extent of the crisis. He had worked in the broadband unit which was trying to create a market for capacity on telephone cables - part of the over-expansion that built the calamitous debts. 
""As we were coming up to the second quarter we were being put under a lot of pressure to boost revenues. But it just wasn't materialising. We had earnings of US$5 million and costs of about US$107 million. I became frustrated when it became apparent there wasn't really a concrete business plan and there were unreasonable expectations. 
""There was a culture of aggressiveness in both trading and in the finance department, and they stepped over the bounds. I'm just surprised there weren't the checks and balances in place. These transactions were going up to board level. It wasn't a couple of rogue trades, it was systematic."" 
As for Mr Allario, the level of disaffection among Enron employees has led him to think there may be a market out there for a broader Web site. 
""I was thinking I could sell T-shirts to Boeing employees and turn it into a full service site for laid-off workers.""

The Enron Tale

If reports of their activities are correct, both the treasury and commerce secretaries listened to top Enron executives, then declined to take any action [""Enron's Influence Reached Deep Into Administration,"" front page, Jan. 18]. 
Unless people believe that government officials should refuse to listen to the concerns of the business world, then our leaders did what they should have done: nothing.
We may need to revisit financial reporting requirements for publicly traded companies. But the government should not attempt to serve as a ""big brother"" investment adviser. 
FRED MAYES 
Upper Marlboro 
* 
Let's see. Enron Corp. made large contributions to the political campaigns of President Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft. Thirty-five Bush administration officials held Enron stock, and several others were paid consultants to the company. Vice President Cheney and his energy task force met with Enron executives at least six times while developing a national energy policy, and Mr. Bush's proposed economic stimulus package would have provided a $254 million rebate to the corporation. 
Although it may turn out that Enron's ties to the administration are perfectly legal, I would find little comfort in such a conclusion. The ability to buy influence and favors at the highest levels of government may be permitted by law, but that doesn't make it right. 
JODY MARSHALL 
McLean 
* 
Enron excelled at avoiding corporate taxes by using offshore, secret accounts. Such accounts are essential to terrorists, for example, but apparently that has not been sufficient cause to demand much change in this system. 
Just how serious is the Bush administration about eliminating this loophole? Such financial secrecy is a threat to the public safety and to the stock market system. 
Restoring the faith of the American public will take more than dog-and-pony shows at airports. 
CHARLES ADAMS 
Bethesda 
* 
What are the odds that anyone of consequence in the management of Enron will be punished in any significant way for the offenses committed against the company's own employees -- let alone the investing public? 
If severe justice is not meted out here, then what will it take? 
Is our government so bribed and so steeped in corruption that no mega-corporation outrage, no matter how egregious, is too much? 
LESLIE K. LEAR 
Timonium 
* 
I find it interesting that Arthur Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino would have the gall to say that Enron failed not because of faulty accounting but ""because the economics [of the Enron business] did not work"" [front page, Jan. 21]. 
While there may be some truth to that claim, it would have been nice if Enron's financial statements accurately reflected the faulty economics instead of misrepresenting the company's financial condition. Misleading financial statements provide little incentive to management to make the changes necessary to make the economics work. 
If there is any justice, Arthur Andersen should find that the economics of doing a poor job of auditing do not work. 
MICHAEL RESING 
Arlington 
In response to the Jan. 17 front-page article ""Legislators Rush to Dump Enron Money"": 
Legislators who received money from Enron should establish an escrow account and place the funds there for disbursement to Enron employees swindled by the company's top executives. 
The top executives at Enron, and those at the Arthur Andersen accounting firm, also should have their assets frozen or placed in escrow for future redistribution to Enron employees who lost all of their invested savings in this unfortunate and criminal act. 
JAMES RICHEY 
Oxon Hill 
* 
George Will's assertion that Enron's political contributions ""bought no Washington help in Enron's crisis"" missed the point [op-ed, Jan. 17]. The real scandal is not who knew what and when as Enron's house of cards began to collapse, it is how and why that house was built in the first place. 
Enron's undue influence on government led Congress and industry regulators to change the rules of the game -- rules that might have protected employees and average shareholders from executive malfeasance. This is the sort of corruption that campaign reformers seek to mitigate. 
Still, it is surprising that Mr. Will, who blamed Enron's spectacular failure on the ""arrogance of executives,"" believes that executive arrogance is unique to Enron or that arrogance can't buy influence with money.

Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower in Quiet Trading 

Natural gas for March delivery on the NYMEX dropped $0.043 to $2.074 per MMBtu yesterday. The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu. The market dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the session between $2.10  $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as locals sold down the contract to the $2.07 support level and went home short. The AGA will release this weeks storage report this afternoon, and while some traders are predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf withdrawal, look for the number to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in the Midwest and Texas, the growing differential between cash and futures, and the perceived premium in the early March contract have kept the market from dropping further. Physical prices retained their premium over futures yesterday on short-term cold weather at some pipelines, maintaining about a $0.07  $0.10 premium over the NYMEX. But cash traders expect the demand to ease quickly as temperatures moderate by t! his weekend. As usual, the market will look to the weekly storage report for short term direction, but it is the massive amount of volumes still in storage compared to last year that has put a cap on longer term price increases. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to plus or minus a few cents yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.02 to $2.20 per MMBtu.

Enron Executives Knew of Losses

Enrons top executives and board of directors knew as early as March that its off the books partnerships were losing money, according to William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School who was appointed Enrons board of directors to investigate the company. In testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that Enron had a $500 million loss in March. Rather than report it to shareholders, Enron gave a partnership called Raptor another $800 million in Enron shares. He said that there is no doubt that almost everyone, from the board of directors on down, knew that the company was attempting to offset investment losses with stock. The partnerships allowed Enron to misrepresent earnings for a period spanning the 3rd quarter of 2000 through the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers told that committee that over 70% of Enrons earnings for that period were false. He said that there were red flags that should have alerted former chairman Ken L! ay to what was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely understood that Enron was using its own stock to offset the losses in the partnerships.

Reliant Shares Plunge after Delay of 4th Quarter Results

Reliant Resources stock plunged more than 13% yesterday, dropping to a 52-week low after it delayed 4th quarter earnings and said it will restate earnings for the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2001 to reflect additional profits of $100 - $130 million. However, it lowered its earnings guidance for 2002. Reliant Resources is 80% owned by Reliant Energy, which also delayed its 4th quarter report. Shares of Reliant Energy dropped $1.98, or 8%, to $22.94. Reliant Resources said it will restate earnings due to a reclassification of purchases and sales of natural gas and power that were originally intended to be cash flow hedges, but said it now believes the transactions did not meet all of the necessary criteria for hedge accounting. Reliants accounting department discovered the error as it was preparing the year-end statement and brought it to the attention of outside auditors and the audit committees of both Reliant boards. As a result of the reclassification, Reliant will recogni! ze in 2001 earnings that which it had expected to recognize in 2002 and 2003, resulting in the lowered earnings estimate. The move will not affect cash flow for any period. Reliant now expects earnings in 2002 of $1.80 - $2.00 per share, below previous estimates of $2.05 - $2.15 to reflect weak economic conditions and steps taken to strengthen its balance sheet. Moody's and S?both said that the announcements would not have any impact on the credit rating of Reliant Resources, which was placed on credit watch after Reliant said it planned to buy Orion Power Holdings for $2.9 billion. The deal also involves assumption of $2.1 billion in debt which could cause problems in todays post-Enron environment. Reliant has lowered its capital spending budget for 2002 to 2006 by $1.6 billion to further strengthen its balance sheet.

Europeans Trade Enron Debt to Limit Exposure

Enrons European creditors are scrambling to cut their losses of billions of dollars to trading partners and banks across the continent. UK energy companies are pairing off debts and credits, owed to and by Enron, as they look to limit the losses. Exposures have been exacerbated in some cases by the invalidity of bank guarantees given by the group just before it failed in November. Debt trading could reduce by millions of dollars the amount of money Enron Europe's bankruptcy administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers can recover as companies try to limit their exposure to the energy group. PWC was appointed in late November to wind up Enron's European division. PWC expects to recoup only about $100 million from contracts held by Enron Europe's main trading unit, Enron Trade Capital Trade Resources. Liabilities in Europe would run in to the billions of dollars, PWC has told creditors.  Many creditors are expecting to recoup little or none of the money owed to them. Debt trading ! is legal during administration but has to stop once the company is put into liquidation, the next stage in the bankruptcy process. The administrators are not necessarily aware of the details of the debt trading and will only be able to see the impact when the company is liquidated and they try to recover the remaining money owed to Enron. PWC will hold Enron creditors' meetings in London next week followed by an auction of the contents of Enron's London headquarters.

ICE to Move Natural Gas Trading to IPE First

The European natural gas business on the IPE will be the first to move onto the electronic platform of the IntercontinentalExchange following the merger of the two exchanges. The move will likely be done this summer. ICE took over the IPE last year in a bid to create a global electronic platform for trading futures and over-the-counter products. ICE eventually plans to transfer all of IPE's business online and away with open outcry pit trading. ICE is owned by 100 of the world's largest energy and metals traders, brokers and bankers. And, what a coincidence that EnronOnline got out of ICE's way just in time as it was approaching critical mass. We were just a tree in the forest, and then the forest burned down, says ICEs CEO. From hosting 2,500 trades totaling $2 billion a day in September, ICE now averages $4 billion per day and 4,600 trades.

Enron Trading Unit May Have Operated in Red

Enron's energy trading unit may have been operating in the red for months prior to its bankruptcy. Enron's Wholesale Services reported 3rd quarter profits climbed to $696 million before interest and taxes, but its profit margin dropped to 1.6%. The ratio of profit to sales does not include funds borrowed to cover $2.8 billion in daily trades by EnronOnline. In filings with the SEC, in the 3rd quarter, the last period for which figures are available, Enrons trading revenue rose 54% to $43.4 billion. In July, Enron officials claimed that the trading unit was dramatically expanding and profitable. The unit was credited with producing 97% of Enrons 2000 revenue. Enron had $28 billion in revenue from trading with a profit of $627 million, or a 2.2% margin before interest and taxes in the 3rd quarter of 2000. Enron's energy trading unit had a 1% profit after taxes and interest last year, according to estimates. But, since Enron didn't account for the funds borrowed to cover $2! .8 billion in daily trades, profit margins may have been much lower or nonexistent. Enron also had 3,000 affiliated partnerships which hid up to $1 billion of losses and some industry insiders have said that Enron's losses may have been too much for any trading unit to cover. One of the partnerships bought 14 Enron power plants for $800 million in 1999, using money that was generated by selling bonds backed by Enron shares. In the 2 years prior to its collapse, Enron sold billions of assets to independent companies and at times for as little as $0.50 on the dollar. In 1999, it received $247 million for a London power plant 10 months after opening it at a cost of $500 million. Last year, Enron sold Azurix for $1.4 billion after paying $2.8 billion for it in 1998. In fact almost everything other than EnronOnline seemed to have to have lost money over the last few yaers, from telecom to Indian power plants.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Subject:	Fantastic Friday/Super Saturday Interviewers

As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.  One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.  It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.  Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:

		Dates						Total Number of Interviewers Needed**

October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview        
November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview		
November 15-16        Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview
November 30-Dec 1   Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview

I have attached a list of those individuals in various business units that have participated in the interview process in the past for your review (as a sample of the type of individual we are looking for as interviewers).  Please provide me a list of your business unit's interviewers by date by Friday, October 5.  Individuals are encouraged to interview more than one selected date and we will forward details to them at least a week prior to the interview date.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks again for all your help.  Ted and Traci

 
**  We do not expect you to provide all the interviewers.  This number reflects to total needed from all business units and will include those needed for both the evening and interview days..

"RE: Bammel Working Gas Sale To AEP","Thanks Jim S.

I suggest that we notify AEP of this amount during our meeting with them this week.  We also need to develop a process of how we are going to update them of the impending volumes at the end of May without compromising our trading position.

Tom M. please discuss with Jim and we can cover at the meeting on the June bid week deal approval process that Lillian is arranging.

Subject:	Bammel Working Gas Sale To AEP

As of today May 9, 2001 Bammel has working gas of approximately 20.3 TBTU.  Economics are favorable to keep injecting.  I estimate that injections will average around 1TBTU per week through May 31, 2001 which would result in another 3+ TBTU beibng injected.  At the current pricing level this means that AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million.  Is this something Accounting should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001?  Should AEP be notified of the volume and approximate value.  Is there anything that needs to be done contractually other than the original agrrement to facilitate this transaction?  I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware!  Please let me know your thoughts.

"Final Working Capital Schedule","Attached is a draft of the ""Final Working Capital Calculation Statement"" that would be attached to the letter that Anne is drafting that needs to be sent to AEP before Friday.  These agree to the amounts that we previously sent to AEP in a letter earlier this month except for a slight adjustment to the Centanna Ad Valorem Tax Expense number as I received an updated number from the Tax Department this week.  I have also told Jim Dedicker at AEP that I will forward him a copy of the bill from Jefferson County once we receive it.  Also keep in mind that this working capital calculation statement does not include the working gas adjustments for Bammel and Centanna which were already sent in a ""Final Working Gas Calculation Statement"" on 10/15.  Please review and verify these numbers and let me know if you think anything needs to changed, added, or omitted ASAP!

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative
2001-10-25 13:49 (New York)

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative

Fitch-NY-October 25, 2001: Fitch places the following Enron
securities on Rating Watch Negative: senior unsecured debt
`BBB+'; subordinated debt `BBB'; preferred stock `BBB-`;
and commercial paper `F2'. Pipeline subsidiary `A-` rated
senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co. and
Transwestern Pipeline Co., are also placed on Rating Watch
Negative.

The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital
market reaction to recent disclosures by the company. The
loss of investor and counterparty confidence, if it
continues, would impair Enron's financial flexibility and
access to capital markets, therefore, impacting its ability
to conduct its business. On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron announced
a $1 billion after-tax charge to earnings to be taken in
the third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheet
equity by $1.2 billion relating to the unwinding of
structured transactions. Since that time, there have been
several damaging news reports on the company and its
management. More importantly, investors have voiced
concerns. Enron's common stock price has plummeted and
spreads on its debt have widened.

The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly
stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its
business. Approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity is
available under committed bank lines.

An additional concern is that certain structured
transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II
and Osprey could unwind. While various sources of repayment
exist, such as the sale or liquidation of underlying
assets, or an equity offering, primary credit support is
derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily
convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to
repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120
days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger
event. In the event that the issuance of the preferred
stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the
senior notes in either case, Enron is required to deliver
additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on
its obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes a
payment obligation of Enron, representing a general
unsecured claim. While trigger events include a downgrade
of Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grade by
one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with
specified declines in Enron's closing stock price over
three consecutive trading days, Enron would have a
forebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt was
being made to register the shares. The total amount of
Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately $3.2 billion. Enron
has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

While capital market uncertainties have escalated, Fitch
has no information to indicate that there are any
fundamental problems with Enron's core wholesale, retail,
and pipeline businesses. Fitch expects to be in contact
with the company on a continuing basis to both monitor
ongoing events and address strategic, longer-term issues.


STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow

10/25/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Share of Enron were higher in opening trade, after the company dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, due to his past involvement in running two partnerships, in which Enron had invested, dealers said. 
At 9.56 am, Enron was up 1.13 usd, or 6.95 pct, at 17.55. The DJIA was down 138.60 points at 9,207.52, the S&P 500 index was down 15.95 pts at 1,069.00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39.02 at 1,692.52.
Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow, after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow-related transactions. 
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement. 
Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. 
McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group, had quit his job as treasurer last year, after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
This morning, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to ""buy- speculative,"" from ""buy-high risk"", to reflect his concerns that ""lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron's commercial operations."" 
""This is the least likely outcome, in our view, but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked,"" he said.

=DJ Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings
2001-10-25 14:13 (New York)

   By Mark Golden, Kristen McNamara, Jon Kamp and John Edmiston 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit
quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no changes in
policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the
companies said Thursday. 

  The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of
the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall
by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial
structure. 

  Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of
the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this
week. 

  ""We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron,"" said John
Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). ""It's business as usual."" 

  Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made
no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and
gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged. 

  Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action.

  ""Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution,"" said
Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North
American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A. 

  Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't
expect to make any drastic changes. 
 


Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues
By Andrew Dowell
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in power sales from the previous period as third-quarter revenues, the company said Thursday. 
The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions.
The state of California has paid more than $11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers, but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state's ailing utilities in mid-January. Two weeks ago, however, the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back. 
""It's that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO,"" Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday. 
Williams reported third-quarter net income of $221.3 million on revenues of $2.81 billion, up from $121.1 million on revenues of $2.33 billion in the same period the year before. 
Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales. The process is complicated by the state's role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities, which aren't creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves. The ISO didn't envision third-party guarantors when it set up its settlement process, and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month, state power officials have said. 
The state says it has set aside $1.2 billion to cover ISO transactions. 
As reported, suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free. 
Willing To Renegotiate 

Separately, Williams' officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long-term contracts with California, provided the result benefited both parties. 
California Gov. Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed. 
Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power-supply obligations - perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market, Malcolm said. 
""We're always willing to sit down with a customer,"" Malcolm said. 
Williams hasn't been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts, Malcolm said. 
Any attempt by California to force through one-sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants, he said. 
""To the extent contracts are changed, financing is going to go away,"" he said. 
Downplaying Enron Opportunities 

Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market-leader Enron Corp. (ENE), saying it focuses on large, long-term structured deals, not the high-volume, physical-market transactions that Enron dominates, Malcolm said. 
Also, TradeSpark - the Internet-based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner - is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron's proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ) suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center. 
""That's interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing,"" Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call. 
Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. 
Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline, a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades. Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark. 
""We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers,"" Malcolm said. 
TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc. (ESPD), Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ), Shell (RD) unit Coral Energy, Dominion (D), Koch Energy Trading Inc., TXU Corp.'s (TXU) TXU Energy unit and Williams Cos.' Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co.

Stocks Expected to Open Lower, Hurt By Weak Economic News

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Wall Street Journal Online News Roundup 
Stocks are expected to open with losses Thursday, weighed down by disappointing U.S. economic news and the European Central Bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.
About an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened, futures on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were sharply lower, suggesting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will post a 94-point loss at the opening bell. 
In one of a trio of negative economic reports, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, or products expected to last more than three years, tumbled 8.5% in September. That was a much steeper drop than the 0.9% decline forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. 
Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 504,000 for the week ended Oct. 20. That was more than the 500,000 jobless claims expected by economists. 
The Labor Department also said that the employment-cost index rose 1% in the third quarter, slightly more than expected. The indicator measures changes in compensation costs, including wages and salaries, as well as costs for employee benefits. 
Later, at 10 a.m. EDT, the National Association of Realtors is expected to say that 5.26 million existing homes were sold last month, down from the 5.5 million sold in August. 
Prior to release of the economic news, S&P futures had pointed to a weaker opening on Wall Street, after the ECB left rates alone despite growing political pressure for another rate cut to help the stumbling European economy. 
In addition to pouring over Thursday's economic reports, investors will spend much of the session sorting through a mountain of earnings reports, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. 
Among companies that announced quarterly earnings so far, Dow Chemical said third-quarter net income plunged 84%, hurt by weak demand, substantial price declines and a slew of charges mostly related to acquisition expenses and restructuring at Dow Corning. 
Among other stocks to watch, Enron on Wednesday replaced its finance chief, Andrew Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the Houston powerhouse saw its stock price continue to fall sharply. 
States suing Microsoft are hiring one of the nation's top trial lawyers, signaling they may seek a harsher antitrust remedy than the White House. Meanwhile, the software giant's Windows XP formally makes its debut Thursday. 
In key overseas markets, stocks were mixed. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index was down 1.2% in intraday trading, while Frankfurt's DAX was 0.9% lower. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.7%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%. 
In Wednesday's session, Wall Street continued to shrug off disappointing earnings news, and focused instead on hopes that low interest rates and the government's economic-stimulus program will produce a recovery. 
Technology issues saw much of the buying, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 27.10 points, or 1.6%, to 1731.54. The Dow industrials inched 5.54 points, or 0.1%, higher to close at 9345.62, despite substantial losses in two of its components, Eastman Kodak and AT&T, which issued weak outlooks. 
In major U.S. market action Wednesday: 
Major stock indexes advanced. But on the Big Board, where 1.34 billion shares traded, 1,374 stocks rose and 1,743 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.89 billion shares changed hands. 
Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, or $4.0625 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.588%. The 30-year bond was up 23/32 to yield 5.330%. Early Thursday, the 10-year note was up 10/32 to yield 4.553% while the long bond was 17/32 higher, yielding 5.303%. 
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 122.87 yen, up from 122.68, while the euro rose against the dollar to 89.35 U.S. cents from 89.07. Early Thursday in New York, the dollar bought 123.17 yen and traded at 88.27 cents to the euro.

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased E

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased Enron
Corp. Common Stock

NEW YORK, NY -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 10/25/01 -- Kaplan Fox
(kaplanfox.com) has filed a class action against Enron Corp. and
certain of the Company's officers and directors in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The suit is
brought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the common
stock of Enron Corporation (""Enron"") (NYSE: ENE) between January 18,
2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period"").

The complaint charges Enron Corp. and certain of its officers and
directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants
engaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliates
and interested parties, which disguised Enron's true financial
position.  Many of the details of these transactions were hidden from
the public.  Defendants used these asset sales to falsely improve
Enron's balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares at an
artificially inflated price.  Certain Enron executives, who held
positions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts of
interest, reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from these
transactions.

The complaint further alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants
made misleading statements regarding the potential value of Enron's
Broadband business, in order to artificially boost Enron's share
price.  With knowledge that Enron's Broadband business would never
post a profit and was seriously overvalued, Defendants continued to
make misleading statements about the Broadband business in order to
maintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels.
Defendants used the artificially inflated value of Enron's Broadband
business to hedge against, in order to gain millions of dollars in
financing.  Defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financing
arrangements.  Defendants hid the true nature of Enron's earnings,
its hedging, its businesses, and the correct state of Enron's
finances from its investors and the market, further artificially
inflating Enron's share price.  While the stock was artificially
inflated for the above reasons, Enron executives engaged in extensive
insider trading, gaining personal proceeds of approximately $482
million during the Class Period, before the public became aware of
the above practices.

Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of the Class and is
represented by Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.  Our firm, with offices
in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and New Jersey has many years of
experience in prosecuting investor class actions and actions
involving financial fraud. For more information about Kaplan Fox &
Kilsheimer LLP, you may visit our website at www.kaplanfox.com

order to serve as a lead plaintiff, you must meet certain legal
requirements.

              Joe Kernen, co-anchor:

              We've got to shift gears into this Enron situation which
              has just been--you've been talking about it quite a bit,
              David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six
              million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last
              two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred
              million in revenues.

              James Cramer, guest market commentator:

              Maybe.

              Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in
              energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything
              that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize
              the whole energy trading arena and...

              Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No
              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that
              Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every
              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the
              California utility system and profited from it.  That's my
              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the
              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going
              to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they
              cornered the market for electricity for about four months,
              made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and
              when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there
              we're going to discover this.

              Kernen:  Let's see what happened...

              Haines:  Now, wait a second...

              David Faber, co-anchor:

              Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is
              that new?  Is that something--

              Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor,
              something...

              Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?

              Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward
              thinking.

              Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited
              partnership transactions of Mr.--

              Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking
              about.

              Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an
              enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a
              nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one
              company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly
              what was happening with the electricity market which then
              wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer
              billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?

              Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's
              yesterday's trading--

              Haines:  Wait a minute.

              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.
              That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that
              Fastow, after four--

              Faber:  Late yesterday.

              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's
              interesting--

              Faber:  He's the CFO--

              Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.

              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these
              off balance sheet partnerships.

              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not
              on thin ice.

              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this
              is your theory.

              Cramer:  This is my theory.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I
              think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze
              that occurred.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.

              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for
              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that
              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements
              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now
              he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market
              down.

              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come
              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and
              those who've left the company as investors over this last
              week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent
              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to
              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their
              investors, they need to come clean with their trading
              counterparties because that is really what people are
              concerned about.

              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big
              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit
              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go
              down, how would that affect energy trading?

              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be
              there on the other side and make good on the trades.

              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?

              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if
              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,
              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.

              Kernen:  Now, why would--

              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.

              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from
              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?
              Because of something that could unravel--

              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities
              they may have--

              Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.

              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of
              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped
              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at
              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?
              They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--

              Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?

              Faber:  They don't know.

              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited
              partners?

              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is
              what some analysts estimated.

              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.

              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets
              that they have in the partnerships themselves.

              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened
              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if
              we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high
              for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.

              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got
              hurt.

              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.

              Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.

              Kernen:  You are.

              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.

              Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know
              what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the
              utility average.  I've worried about the transportation
              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have
              replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this
              chart?  We're breaking below the--

              Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.

              Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?

              Cramer:  I'm all fired up!

              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting
              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you
              going down to Houston yourself?

              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that
              whole city.

              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down
              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back
              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are
              retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?

              Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going
              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing
              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much
              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the
              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much
              stronger than before.

              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about
              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I
              don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at
              this point.  That's a long way.

              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but
              I still think that--

              Kernen:  It's no longer the--

              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety
              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.

Sounds like a doable plan.  Yes, I can take Mom to the symphony.  Yes, I will leave the tickets (4) for your group including Krista.  The symphony time is 2:30, I check the tickets last night.

Margaret,
 
Tom is planning to go on Sunday morning the 16th.  He said he will plan to leave in time for us to leave out here for the symphony.  He told your Mom if it runs a long time, he might have to leave before they serve lunch.  He said he may have to pick your parents up that morning to give them a ride.  I  can pick up Krista when we leave for the symphony.  Would it be easiest if we just meet you and your Mom at the symphony?  You could leave our tickets with Krista so we would have them when we pick her up.  Is the time 2:30 or 3:00?

Tom,
 
I received an e-mail from Linda Carter asking about certification.  I assume you will get a schedule tonight at the meeting.  She was asking about David, her son, being certified this year.  The way I read the new rule, is that you have to be 19 to be certified.  I told her I would ask you to ask about that new rule at the meeting tonight to be sure we understand it.  It is posted on their website www.nwal.org .

I talked to Brian and he and I agreed to the concept but we want it to more simple (ie. less expensive).  We are thinking about just getting together and have some beers at Cabo's while signing Christmas cards.  No catering, just a few drinks and maybe some appetizers off the menu.  The traders probably don't have many if any customers that are not already covered by Brian's group but check with Eric, Joe, Charlie, Daren and Dave.

Tom,

Michael Salinas is planning the Christmas Card Signing Party.  It looks like it's going to be at Cabo's THIS MONDAY, December 3rd at 5:00.  

I assume that we will be splitting the cost, but I guess I really shouldn't assume because of everything the company is going through right now.  Michael estimates the total cost to be $1000, making your half $500.  Let me know what you think.

Also, are there any customers (for the trading side) that we need to be sure are included to receive Christmas cards?  

Thanks,
Laura

John,

You or Greg need to address the various groups with whatever generic information you can as to where we are in the process, expected timeline, hurdles before start up again, starting VAR and general organizational structure.  People are moving from frustration to feeling insulted that they are expected to sit still with no information.  I know you have a lot on your plate but if we really want people to hang in there a little longer before we address each individual's situation they need some sense of when they can expect closure.

Tom

"Bammel Inventory -Sale of the working gas in place from ENA to HPLC.","Per Gas Accounting, before an invoice can be generated in Unify to move ENA's working gas balance to HPLC, Enron needs to execute a confirm and a deal ticket under the existing Master Purchase/Sale agreement between ENA and HPLC.  This will need to be done in order to consolidate the inventory within HPLC for the sale of the working gas to AEP at close.  Otherwise sales will need to be executed at close from both ENA and HPLC.  This won't be feasable since HPLC currently has  a negative working gas balance of (18) BCF and ENA has a positive balance of 20 BCF.  ENA has not had any storage activity at Bammel over the last year (i.e. since the Texas Desk started doing business as HPLC) however withdrawls by HPLC have taken place of gas originally injected by ENA.  All of this gas has been injected and withdrawn as Texas Desk gas but by two different legal entities.  

Jim Pond
Please provide the exact Bammel working gas volumes for ENA to the Texas Desk (David Baumbach) that should be moved to HPLC

David
Please coodinate the execution of a confirm and Deal Ticket.

Subject:	RE: Bammel Inventory

Nothing has happened as for as I know.  ENA and HPLC still have balance at Bammel.  One is positive and one is negative.  What should have happend is a transfer in place of the gas from ENA to HPLC.

Gas accounting has asks for this and I think Brenda Herod has also attempted to get this done last year, but it has not happened.

Let us know if you have any other questions.

Thanks,

Troy

Have we made any moves to consolidate all of the inventory in to one entity?  Right now the inventory is split into different ones.  I know Troy had stated that we would have to go through legal to get this changed.

You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format.

Enron cuts shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd due to partnership deal

10/18/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
LONDON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it has reduced its shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd as the company decided to repurchase 55 mln of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition. 
Enron did not disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on Tuesday, when the Houston-based energy giant announced a 1.01 bln usd charge to third-quarter earnings that produced a 618 mln usd loss.
However, the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday. As a result of the reduction, Enron's shareholder equity dropped to 9.5 bln usd, the company said. 
In an interview, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said about 35 mln usd of the 1.01 bln usd charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM2 Co-Investment LP, a limited partnership created and run by Fastow. 
In a conference call yesterday with investors, Lay said 55 mln shares had been repurchased by Enron, as the company ""unwound"" its participation in the transactions. In the third quarter, the company's average number of shares outstanding was 913 mln. 
According to Rick Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, these shares were contributed to a ""structured finance vehicle"" set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM2 were the only investors. In exchange for the stock, the entity provided Enron with a note. 
The aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments. Causey did not elaborate on what form those hedges took. 
Subsequently, both the value of Enron's stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply, the report said. As a result, Enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares. When Enron reacquired the shares, it also canceled the note it had received from the entity. 
Given all the complexities of the LJM-related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company, ""the confusion factor wasn't worth the trouble of trying to continue this,"" Causey said. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, described the capital reduction ""as just a balance-sheet issue"" and therefore was not deemed ""material"" for disclosure purposes.

Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects

10/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as ""data adequate"" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said. 
The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.
Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004. The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission. 
GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand. 
The company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002. 
Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract.

USA: Enron's stock slides as equity reduction digested.

10/18/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. stock fell sharply on Thursday as investors digested news of a $1.2 billion reduction in the energy giant's shareholder equity that attracted little attention when it was first disclosed earlier this week. 
In afternoon trading Enron's stock was off $2.96 or, 9.2 percent at $29.24 per share.
Enron reported its first quarterly loss in over four years on Tuesday after taking charges of $1.01 billion against earnings to cover expenses and writedowns on investments that fall outside its core wholesale energy operations. 
The reduction in shareholder equity was not mentioned in the company's earnings statement but was discussed by Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay in an earnings conference call with analysts and investors on Tuesday. 
""Confidence has been shaken by the incremental disclosure. This is an extremely widely held stock and to assume that everybody listened to the conference call is probably asking too much,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified. 
The reduction in equity was prominently reported in the Wall Street journal on Thursday, bringing it to the attention of a wider audience, analysts said. 
Lay said the equity writedown and a corresponding reduction in the number of Enron shares outstanding were related to the early termination of structured finance arrangements which had drawn criticism from some Wall Street analysts. 
As a result of the operation, Enron's debt to total capitalization ratio will rise to about 50 percent, but the company expects the proceeds of asset sales to reduce the ratio to around 40 percent by the end of next year, Lay said. 
Moody's Investor Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade because writedowns and charges had substantially reduced valuations for several Enron businesses. 
Some of Enron's financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings.

Brazil's Copene, Elektro Plan to Sell 820 Mln Reais of Bonds
2001-10-18 13:53 (New York)


     Rio de Janeiro, Oct. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Two Brazilian
companies have asked securities regulators for permission to sell
820 million reais ($279 million) of bonds, raising the amount of
pending local market bond sales to 7.5 billion reais.

     Brazil's Copene-Petroquemica do Nordeste SA, a Petrochemical
company, has asked Brazil's government for permission to sell 625
million reais of bonds according to the country's security and
exchange regulator, the CVM. Banco Citibank SA, the Brazilian unit
of Citigroup Inc., will manage the sale.

     Elektro Eletricidade e Servicos SA, an electricity utility
controlled by U.S.-based Enron Corp. that distributes electricity
in Sao Paulo state, has asked for permission to sell 195 million
reais of bonds, according to a CVM filing.

     No further details about the sales was immediately available.
     Brazilian companies have scrambled to sell debt at home as
the local currency, the real, plunges against the dollar, making
dollar-denominated debt expensive and causing losses to mount as
the local currency value of dollar debts soars.

     So far this year, about 9.1 billion reais of local market
debt has been sold. Meanwhile corporate bond sales in euros or
dollars has slipped by almost two thirds to $1.7 billion in the
third quarter from $4.5 billion in the second, not including sales
through offshore subsidiaries, according to Bloomberg data.

"RE: Vacation Time for Texas Desk traders","Tom, here's a short version of the vacation hours that everyone has REMAINING.  Just FYI, I went ahead and included everyone on the desk.  I've also included a spreadsheet that I downloaded from SAP, which shows more detail.  It is shown in hours, as well.  Let me know if you need anything else!  

Laura

Eric Bass  -  88 hrs vacation remaining
Dave Baumbach  -  80 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
Gary Bryan  -  160 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
JD Buss  -  120 hrs vac remaining
Daren Farmer  -  68 hrs vac remaining
Bryan Hull  -  128 hrs vac remaining
Mark Knippa  -  152 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
Tom Martin  -  104 hrs vac remaining
Mike Olsen  -  96 hrs vac remaining
Joe Parks  -  96 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
Jim Schwieger  -  0 hrs vac remaining
Jay Smith  -  30 hrs vac remaining
Laura Vuittonet  -  71 hrs vac remaining
Charlie Weldon  -  60 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet

One more thing ... the report does not include vacation taken between the dates of November 1st thru November 15th.  The November 15th pay period is when I enter that information, so SAP does not have it yet.  I corrected the email for those who have taken vacation during this pay period (so far), which were Charlie, Joe, Eric, Mark, and you.  

Also, Dave's vacation is not appearing in SAP, so the report shows NONE of his vacation time.  He and I talked about this, and he has 8 days remaining.  I am going to correct his vacation time in SAP.

Judge will tell Enron to release internal report 
By ERIC BERGER 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 30, 2002, 11:14PM
NEW YORK -- A federal bankruptcy judge said Wednesday he will order Enron Corp. to release an internal report investigating its questionable partnerships and accounting practices. 
The report will be posted early next week on the Web site of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of Southern New York, Enron lawyer Brian S. Rosen said. 
The report could shed light on the murky investment vehicles used by Enron to move assets, and debts, off its balance sheet. 
Losses from these off-balance-sheet deals helped trigger the crisis in confidence that led to the Houston company's downfall. 
The partnerships are a prime target of the investigations by Congress and regulators. 
Judge Arthur Gonzalez issued the order at the request of creditors committee attorney Luc Despins, who said the document should be made public as part of the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. 
Rosen did not oppose the release of the report, conducted by a committee appointed by the company's board of directors after Enron's collapse. 
""We're trying to work as best we can with the creditors committee,"" Rosen said. 
In October, Enron appointed the four-member panel, chaired by University of Texas law school dean William Powers, to look into the financial partnerships headed by the former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
Reports have suggested that Fastow and a handful of Enron associates made millions in 2000 as general partners of LJM2, the bigger of the two partnerships. 
As part of its investigation, the board of directors' special committee hired William McLucas, former head of the SEC's enforcement division and now a partner at Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Washington. 
The move last fall came as Enron disclosed that it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for these partnerships. 
SEC investigators have subpoena powers and their investigation is ongoing. 
In other business before the bankruptcy court Wednesday, Gonzalez approved an Enron motion to transfer software and real estate contracts affiliated with the energy marketing and trading business -- now named UBS Warburg Energy -- it has sold to Swiss bank UBS Warburg. 
Gonzalez also disclosed Wednesday that his wife, through her membership in the New York City Teacher Retirement Service, had a financial stake in Enron. 
The retirement fund, valued at about $87 billion, lost about $109 million as Enron stock collapsed, the judge said. 
But because his wife's ownership was in a mutual fund that held the stock, and she herself was not a director of the fund, Gonzalez said he did not have an interest in Enron stock and could continue hearing the bankruptcy case. 


Ex-Enron CEO Skilling to Testify at Senate Hearing
2002-01-31 15:55 (New York)

     Washington, Jan. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Corp. Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling will answer questions from a Senate subcommittee investigating the unraveling of the energy trader, the chairman of the panel said.
     ""Having Mr. Skilling express a willingness to testify is another big step,'' Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, said at a news conference.
     ""It is a totally consistent approach Mr. Skilling has taken all along,'' said Judy Leon, a spokeswoman for the former executive. ""He has been open and honest with the investigations ongoing.''
     Enron founder Kenneth Lay is scheduled to testify Monday before Dorgan's Consumer Affairs Subcommittee. A separate hearing will be scheduled for Skilling, who quit Houston-based Enron last August, two months before the company announced losses in several partnerships that preceded its slid into bankruptcy.
     Lay has agreed to testify without promises of immunity from prosecution, Dorgan said. Skilling's lawyers haven't sought such a promise from the committee.
     Dorgan said he will ask Lay and Skilling about 3,000 partnerships Enron created to hide debt and losses. Investigators at 10 congressional committees, the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission are focusing what role the two executives played in overseeing the partnerships. Both men denied any wrongdoing,

Partnership Documents

     Dorgan said Enron still hasn't provided documents the panel requested about the partnerships, such as LJM Cayman LP and Chewco Investments LP. The committee is renewing two earlier queries about how they were set up and who invested in them.
     ""The shroud of secrecy that surrounds so much of what this corporation has done will not be allowed to stand,'' Dorgan said.
     An SEC investigation into Enron's bookkeeping forced the company last year to restate earnings for the previous four-and-a- half years, lowering them by $586 million. It also reported third quarter losses in many of its operations and terminated several of its limited partnerships, wiping out $1.2 billion in shareholder equity.
     Documents released by a U.S. House committee investigating Enron's failure, show that some Enron managers warned Lay shortly after Skillings departed that the company was hiding losses in the partnerships. Lay returned to the job of chief executive after Skilling left. He resigned Jan. 23 under pressure from creditors.

USA: Senate probe finds Enron uncooperative - Dorgan.

01/31/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. has not cooperated with a Senate Commerce Committee inquiry into the energy trading firm's collapse, but former executives of the company have agreed to testify before the committee, said U.S. Sen. Byron Dorgan on Thursday. 
""The Enron Corp. is not cooperating with the committee's request for information,"" said Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat and chairman of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer affairs probing Enron's downfall.
In a press conference, Dorgan said the committee expects to hear from former Enron chairman Kenneth Lay at a hearing on Monday in his first public remarks about the Enron collapse. Lay resigned as an Enron executive on Jan. 23. 
Former Enron chief executive Jeffrey Skilling ""has declined the committee's request to appear before it on Feb. 4, but has agreed to testify before it at a later date,"" said Dorgan, adding another hearing would be set to hear from Skilling. 
Dorgan said former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow ""has not responded to any of the committee's communications."" Both Skilling and Fastow had been invited to testify at Monday's hearing. 
Senate Commerce is one of nine congressional committees probing the stunning collapse last fall of Houston-based Enron, which devastated investors and destroyed thousands of jobs. 
The committee has asked Enron to provide it with information about hundreds of partnerships that the company used to move debt off its books and enhance profits. The partnerships were central to Enron's financial unraveling. 
""To date, the corporation has provided no information to the committee about these partnerships,"" Dorgan said. ""The corporation has provided some information, not enough and not the critical information we need, especially about off-the-books partnerships."" 
Dorgan displayed a chart showing that Enron had 2,832 subsidiaries, with 872 of them in offshore tax havens - the highest subsidiaries tally among U.S. corporations in 2001. 
The chart showed that the U.S. company with the next highest number of subsidiaries was automaker General Motors Corp. with just 316 subsidiaries. 
""The shroud of secrecy that has surrounded so much of what this corporation has done will not be allowed to stand. Congress will insist on receiving all the information about the partnerships,"" the senator said. 
Dorgan said that the boxes of information that the committee has received include minutes of board meetings. ""I'm sure we will raise those at the hearing, we'll certainly be discussing with Mr. Lay a range of those issues."" 
The Washington Post reported on Thursday that members of Enron's board received detailed briefings as early as four years ago about the Enron's controversial partnerships. 
Dorgan said, ""It's sufficient to say that the board of directors discussed, on various occasions, the creation of partnerships, the structure of the business deals. But I think you will hear more about that in the hearings.""

WASHINGTON (AP)--Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) has failed to provide a Senate committee with important information about a web of partnerships used to conceal massive debts, a senator leading an investigation said Thursday. 
Enron officials ""just simply have not cooperated"" in providing the documents sought, said Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., chairman of a Senate Commerce subcommittee. ""We again renew our request.""
An estimated 3,000 partnerships, some with names of ""Star Wars"" characters such as Jedi, were created by Enron _ which took a 97% stake in each of them and brought in outside investors for the remainder. The partnerships were kept off Enron's books and helped create the accounting debacle that pushed the company into the biggest U.S. corporate bankruptcy ever on Dec. 2. 
Dorgan said the committee didn't immediately plan to issue a subpoena to the company. 
Attorneys representing Enron didn't immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. 
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman until his resignation last week and a supporter of President Bush, has agreed to testify at the committee's hearing on Monday, Dorgan told reporters. He said Lay's attorneys have not asked for immunity from prosecution as a condition.

Enron's Web of Complex Hedges, Bets
Finances: Massive trading of derivatives may have clouded the firm's books, experts say. 

By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, L. A. Times Staff Writer
January 31, 2002

As accountants and investigators begin poring over Enron Corp.'s books, they are likely to collide head-on with a factor that makes its finances particularly impenetrable--the extent to which the company relied on financial instruments known as commodity derivatives to inflate income, hide losses and misrepresent the true nature of its business. 

Although to this day Enron is generally known as an energy trading company, a close review of financial records and interviews with accounting experts show that at its heart it had become a massive trading operation in derivatives, which are financial contracts that can entail significant risks. 

Missteps in such trading have cost highly sophisticated investors billions in past years. Among other cases, derivatives trading was behind Orange County's bankruptcy filing in 1994 and the failure of Barings Bank in 1995. 

Derivatives, which come in many forms, allow investors to bet with other investors on changes in an underlying asset or index, such as stocks, interest rates, weather or electricity prices. Properly used, derivatives are effective at hedging against an almost infinite variety of business risks ranging from crop failures to changes in interest rates and oil prices. But they can sharply exaggerate market gains or losses. 

There are signs that, in the company's hands, derivatives evolved into more than risk-hedging devices. They became tools of fiscal concealment and manipulation, some experts say. 

Among other things, derivatives allowed Enron to inflate the value of its assets and transactions while understating their risks and obscuring their real nature, they say. 

""Enron used derivatives to manipulate accounting standards and tax reporting,"" said Randall Dodd, head of the Derivatives Study Group, an economics watchdog. ""They used them to fabricate income. It was a bit of a shell game."" 

Enron spokesman Mark Palmer on Wednesday declined to discuss the company's accounting. He said the issue ""is being investigated by a special committee of our board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. They may reveal facts that may lead us to take further action."" 

It is still unclear to investors and government investigators how big a role losses on these contracts played in Enron's collapse. Nor is the full extent of the damage yet known. Some analysts believe the company still may be losing money on some contracts. 

Much Derivatives Trading Unregulated

Enron could engage in its complex trading strategy without fear of regulatory intervention because the government explicitly exempted much derivatives trading from oversight. That's at least in small part because of a ruling by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's former chairwoman, Wendy L. Gramm, just five weeks before she joined the Enron board in 1993. Gramm is the wife of Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas). 

The trading market for the contracts has blossomed in the last decade, with nearly $100 trillion traded worldwide as of last June, according to the Bank for International Settlements. 

Most of these were so-called over-the-counter or OTC derivatives--those not traded on a registered futures or options exchange, but rather contracts between big investors. 

Enron did not entirely conceal that aspect of its business. As early as October 1999, its then-chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, told CFO Magazine that the company's finance business would ""buy and sell risk positions."" 

""Enron may have been just an energy company when it was created in 1985,"" said Frank Partnoy, a law professor at the University of San Diego who testified before the Senate last week. ""But by the end it had become a full-blown OTC derivatives trading firm."" 

The world of derivatives was almost tailor-made for the aggressively secretive Enron. Accountants still have not settled on a consistent way to represent their value and risk on a company's books. The relevant standard set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, an independent agency that sets guidelines for corporate auditors, is Rule 133--a behemoth that stands at more than 800 pages. 

Enron's derivatives-related assets soared to $21 billion in 2000 from $3.1 billion the year before, according to the company's 2000 annual report. This enormous growth, apparently related to its Internet trading system, Enron Online, made it the fifth-largest commodity derivatives dealer in the U.S., according to figures compiled by Swaps Monitor, a market research firm. 

Nevertheless, the company also reported last year that its net financial exposure to derivatives was only $66 million. Although that figure tripled from the year before, analysts contend that it is absurdly low, considering that a large portion of the contracts covered long-term energy deals subject to dramatic price fluctuations. 

""Clearly these values are no longer credible,"" said Robert McCullough, a Portland, Ore., energy consultant. 

Enron's accounting treatment of these highly complex transactions, including stock options and loan guarantees, raises the possibility that millions more in liabilities lie concealed in transactions yet to be unwound. 

In one deal alone, a financing arrangement with a partnership called Whitewing, formed to hold a melange of Enron assets including a Brazilian utility and European power plants, Enron's exposure to losses may be as much as $2.1 billion rather than the $600 million the company has disclosed. 

""These are transactions evolving daily, but disclosed only periodically,"" said McCullough, who analyzed the deal. ""This is a bucking bronco by any investment standard."" 

Moreover, because trades in OTC contracts are entirely unregulated, ""OTC derivatives dealers don't have to register, report, maintain a capital base,"" Dodd said. ""You could set up a lemonade stand and run a $250-billion derivatives book."" 

Former regulator Gramm's ruling covered only a small category of swaps negotiated between two parties. But it helped open the floodgates to a huge variety of derivatives contracts, which were labeled ""swaps"" to fit within the ruling. 

Still, it was unclear whether all OTC derivatives could remain unregulated indefinitely. 

Banks, hedge funds and traders, including Enron and its fellow energy trading companies, strove desperately to keep government hands off. They argued that the participants in the market were mostly huge institutions savvy enough to protect themselves from fraud without government help. 

When the Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed in 1998 regulating the OTC market, ""the large derivative interests, including Enron, went up in arms,"" recalled I. Michael Greenberger, then the commission's director of trading and markets and now a law professor at the University of Maryland. 

The traders won the battle in December 2000, when Congress passed a law rendering OTC derivatives permanently exempt from regulation. 

Around that time, Enron's participation in the market mushroomed. 

Enron's ability to keep losses off its books through complex swaps and option contracts is demonstrated in its deal with Raptor, one of the investment partnerships about which Enron Vice President Sherron S. Watkins raised questions in a now-famous anonymous letter in August to Chairman Kenneth L. Lay. 

Enron had transferred to Raptor ownership of $1.2 billion in shares in Rhythms NetConnections, a high-tech company whose stock had rocketed in value after Enron invested in it. Enron recorded the transfer as a financial gain, but did not clearly disclose that it also entered a derivatives contract that required it to cover Raptor's losses if Rhythms declined in value, as it eventually did. 

Inside the web of this transaction, hundreds of millions of dollars in losses in Rhythms fell through the cracks, unrecorded on Enron's books. The complexity confounded Watkins. 

""I can't find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss,"" Watkins told Lay. Nevertheless, she suspected the truth--that the losses belonged on Enron's books. ""If it's Enron,"" she wrote, ""then I think we do not have a fact pattern that would look good to the SEC or investors."" 

In at least one case, Enron apparently used derivatives to help inflate the value of an asset as it was transferred off its books. This may have allowed the company to revalue similar assets that remained in its hands, using the inflated value as a benchmark. 

The asset in question was ""dark"" fiber-optic cable that Enron transferred in June 2000 to LJM2, a partnership managed by Fastow, then its own CFO. At the time the real value of dark fiber--installed data lines not yet equipped to carry traffic--was conjectural. About 40 million miles of fiber optics had been installed in the U.S., but within a year a glut would bankrupt several communications companies. 

LJM paid $100 million in cash and credit to Enron, which promptly claimed a $67-million profit on the deal, suggesting that the real value of the fiber was $33 million. 

LJM subsequently transferred most of the fiber to yet another Enron-associated partnership, this time for $113 million. This step implicitly revalued the fiber at more than triple its original value. 

Supporting the second sale, however, was a derivative issued by Enron, in effect covering any loss the buyers might incur if the fiber's value collapsed, as it did during 2001. 

Eventually Enron would have to declare the loss on its own books. But Watkins' letter suggests that this would not happen until the partnerships were closed out in 2002 and 2003--years after Enron reported a profit from the original sale. 

'Not the Only One of Its Kind'

Analysts suspect deals like this were more common than Enron has disclosed. 

""It seems likely that the 'dark fiber' deal was not the only one of its kind,"" Partnoy said last week in testimony before Congress. 

He and others also believe that Enron traders may have manipulated their profit and loss figures by improperly valuing derivative contracts in illiquid markets--that is, those in which there is so little activity that a small transaction can move prices sharply. These include contracts to deliver energy at some point far in the future; indeed, the company disclosed that at year-end 2000, it held about $13 billion in energy contracts denominated in terms of up to 24 years. 

Palmer, the Enron spokesman, rejected any suggestion that the company's traders manipulated energy prices. ""This is stuff that's in the past and been investigated by half the Western world,"" he said, referring to probes of West Coast electricity price spikes during the power crisis last year. ""We need to look ahead, not engage in this sort of proctology."" 

Accountants are well aware that such derivatives are prone to ""mismarking."" 

""We recognize that some fair values are more difficult to set than others,"" said Timothy S. Lucas, director of research and technical activities for the Financial Accounting Standards Board. ""In some cases, we may not have a really good idea of fair value."" 

To some professionals this is only a further sign that Congress erred in removing OTC derivatives from regulatory oversight. 

""OTC derivatives are as powerful as futures and securities,"" Greenberger said. ""If there's anything we're learning, it's that the big boys maybe can't take care of themselves.""

Enron Counsel Warned About Partnerships
Probe: Company's legal vice president asked opinion of law firm in April. Congressional investigators say it was to ""halt this practice.""

By RONE TEMPEST, L. A. Times Staff Writer
January 31, 2002

HOUSTON -- The earliest warning sign yet about Enron Corp.'s outside investment partnerships may have come from the company's in-house legal counsel.

In April of last year, Enron legal Vice President Jordan Mintz asked a prominent New York law firm to review the partnerships and provide legal advice.

The resulting opinion, issued six weeks later by law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, advised Enron to ""halt this practice,"" according to congressional investigators.

Sources in Enron said Mintz was concerned about the partnerships and took action without the knowledge or approval of senior management, including Enron General Counsel James V. Derrick Jr. and Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow.

Mintz's action came four months before Vice President Sherron S. Watkins sent her memo to Chairman Kenneth L. Lay warning of the energy company's impending collapse.

Mintz used the law firm's opinion to write one of several memos opposing the network of off-the-books partnerships in which some senior executives, notably Fastow, had financial interest. Enron used some of the partnerships to hide debt from shareholders' view.

At the time, it was a precarious route for Mintz, a 45-year-old father of five, in the still-highflying corporation. Fastow had recruited him for vice president and general counsel for Enron Global Finance. Contacted Wednesday, Mintz declined to comment, citing attorney-client privilege.

Mintz's role in the Enron saga began to emerge this week as congressional investigators asked Enron to provide a copy of the Fried Frank report.

The disclosure of Mintz's concerns is seen by investigators as more evidence that top Enron executives were aware of the company's problems long before they were publicly acknowledged.

Financial analysts began scrutinizing the company when Jeffrey K. Skilling resigned as chief executive Aug. 14, but Skilling and Lay insisted that the company was on solid footing.

Another executive who may have been aware of the company's problems was Jeffrey McMahon, the former company treasurer promoted to president this week.

In an Aug. 22 memo to Lay, Watkins identified McMahon (and former Vice Chairman J. Clifford Baxter, who was found dead last week from what police say was a suicide) as one of the executives concerned about the partnerships.

McMahon was asked Wednesday about his objections to the partnerships. But McMahon, speaking to reporters in a conference call about the company's restructuring, declined to comment.

""All these things are under investigation by a variety of departments and authorities and whatnot. So in lieu of that, I think I'd prefer just to stick on the restructuring topic today,"" McMahon said.

Mintz was recruited to Houston to work with Exxon Corp. and later was hired by a large local law firm, Bracewell & Patterson, where he worked as a tax attorney for nine years.

In 1996, Enron was one of his firm's clients during a thwarted hostile takeover attempt by Houston energy magnate Oscar Wyatt. Impressed with his work, Enron hired Mintz later that year to work in the corporate tax division.

In October 2000, Fastow recruited Mintz to the legal team of Enron Global Finance. It was there that Mintz first encountered the system of partnerships.

Mintz was one of several in the legal department wary of the possible conflict of interest involved in doing business with entities controlled by other Enron insiders.

By April of last year, Mintz's concern was such that he believed Enron could benefit from outside scrutiny. One reason for this, as Watkins noted in her memo to Lay, was that Enron law firm Vinson & Elkins had approved many of the controversial partnerships. Derrick was a former partner at Vinson & Elkins.

Among colleagues at Enron, it was understood that one of the main reasons Mintz hired Fried Frank was that it had strong expertise in securities law and had no affiliation with Enron.

Six weeks later, the New York law firm, according to a letter to Derrick from the chairman of a House congressional committee, the review concluded that Enron should ""halt this practice"" of the special partnerships.

In the letter to Derrick, Reps. W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations, asked for a copy of the law firm report.

Post-Enron Changes May Scrap 3% Rule on Partnerships
2002-01-31 13:45 (New York)

     New York, Jan. 31 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. accounting rulemakers may abandon a measure that allowed Enron Corp. to shift debt off its books through partnerships with investors who took as little as 3 percent of the risk.
     Enron used the so-called 3 percent rule to keep $2.6 billion in debt from three partnerships off its balance sheet, then was forced to consolidate the debt and wipe out $502 million in profits back to 1997. The rule permits companies to shed debts or assets onto affiliated partnerships if independent investors contribute at least 3 percent of the partnerships' funding.
     The Financial Accounting Standards Board plans to propose measures by June addressing how much outside capital an affiliate must have to be treated as an independent entity. A test like the 3 percent rule encourages financial engineering and should be replaced by a standard that looks at whether outsiders control the partnership and bear the risks, accounting experts said.
     ""The issue is control,'' said Jack Murray, vice president and special counsel for First American Title Insurance Co., an expert on off-balance-sheet financing. ``If you set up an entity as a pass-through vehicle, and all it can do is what you tell it to do, you should have to put it on your balance sheet.''

Broader Review

     The scrutiny of the 3 percent rule is part of a wider review by FASB of the standards governing ""special purpose entities.'' Many U.S. companies use such vehicles. Some airlines create trusts to finance their planes, and financial companies use them to fund credit card debts. In most cases, the partnerships are controlled, and majority owned, by outsiders, experts said.
     Enron took SPEs to a new level, creating more than 3,000 affiliated partnerships and subsidiaries that collapsed in the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, accounting experts say.
     Ray Simpson, project manager for FASB, said the accounting group has two priorities for rules it hopes to propose in the second quarter: guidelines to guard against entities with ""insufficient independent economic substance'' and standards to prevent use of a ``straw man'' as the third-party investor. FASB's decisions determine what meets ``generally accepted accounting principles.''

'Skin in the Game'

     Initially proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1990 as a minimum to ensure outsiders had some ``skin in the game,'' in the words of former SEC Chief Accountant Lynn Turner, the 3 percent rule has evolved into the primary test for when companies can avoid consolidating the results of special purpose entities they sponsor.
     The point of SPEs is to avoid consolidation, allowing the sponsoring company to keep the debts and assets of the SPE off its books while recording gains and losses from transactions with the affiliate.
     To meet the standards for off-balance sheet treatment, an SPE's assets must be legally isolated from the parent company and an independent third party must have a substantive investment at risk. Many accounting experts argue FASB's new standards should avoid setting a specific level of investment, such as 3 percent, that is sufficient for an outside investor.

'Bright Lines'

     ""If you try to build a system or a process that eliminates judgment to the maximum extent, the auditor can go to the client and point at the rule and say, 'This is what you can do,''' said Michael Sutton, who was the SEC's chief accountant between 1995 and 1998. ""It's inevitable you are going to have these financial engineers that find ways to work around those rules.''
     The 3 percent rule highlights a broader debate in accounting between advocates of ""principles-based'' rules that require auditors to look at the economic substance of a transaction and those who argue for ""bright lines'' that clearly define what a company can and cannot do.
     Adopting a more principles-based approach will be difficult because without specific rules ""companies are going to say, 'Where does it say I can't do it?'' said Jim Harrington, head of accounting and SEC technical services for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, the biggest accounting firm. Still, he said he thinks accounting should shift in that direction because ""it does away with the financial engineering.''
     Outside the United States, accounting standards focus on determining who is in control and provide a series of tests that auditors can use.
     ""There are indicators, but the concept is control,'' said Mary Barth, an accounting professor at Stanford University and a member of the International Accounting Standards Board. ""It's a philosophical difference. The U.S. has seemed more comfortable with bright line rules, but the international standards have much less of that. It all comes down to judgment.''

'Forest for the Trees'

     Under IASB rules, even majority ownership wouldn't necessarily require the entity be included on the balance sheet if, for example, someone else owned convertible bonds or another security that could become equity ownership.
     ""When you write these really detailed rules, sometimes you lose the forest for the trees,'' said Robert Herz, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers who also is on the International Accounting Standards Board. ``In IAS rules, you look more at substance than form. There's no 3 percent rule and in fact the presumption is the opposite. If the special purpose entity is thinly capitalized, you'd presume it should be consolidated.''
     FASB officials said their goal is to approve the first revisions of rules on SPEs by the end of the year.

FASB Priorities

     ""We're going to approach this issue in a fairly narrow way in an effort to get some answers that are particularly relevant to special purpose entities approved quickly,'' said FASB President Edmund Jenkins.
     Drawing the line on what constitutes a ""straw man'' in an SPE may be difficult. Regulators will try to address cases where ""a relative, a former or current employee, or somebody else who has a de facto agency relationship'' with the sponsoring company may not be truly independent, Simpson said.
     Once FASB deals with the first revisions of rules on SPEs, the group plans to address two more areas: treatment of convertible securities or derivatives that might change the distribution of equity in the affiliate, and treatment of different types of shareholder rights that define who is in control, Simpson said.

Chewco Case Study

     Enron's use of two partnerships, Chewco and JEDI, illustrates the kind of ""aggressive accounting'' described by Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, in internal documents subpoenaed by Congress. Enron employees set up Chewco in 1997 when the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S. pension fund, wanted to exit the JEDI joint venture it had with Enron.
     Calpers' JEDI stake was valued at $383 million, and Enron needed a new investor. Enron made a loan of $132 million to Chewco, and guaranteed another loan for $240 million, putting the company on the hook for exactly 97 percent of Chewco's total funding, which was used to buy out Calpers from JEDI. Michael J. Kopper, an Enron employee, was manager of the Chewco general partner at the time.
     In testimony to Congress, Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino said the auditor was told the rest, $11.4 million, came from a ""large financial institution.'' Andersen said last year it learned that half of that $11.4 million actually came, indirectly, from Enron.

Calls for Change

     That meant Chewco wasn't independent, and therefore JEDI wasn't either. So because of a $6 million difference in the outside funding for Chewco, Enron erased $399 million in profits over four and a half years and added back $2.6 billion in debt that had been inappropriately kept off the books. A similar violation of the 3 percent rule with another partnership, LJM1, erased another $103 million in previously reported profits.
     The restatements, coming on top of revelations that Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, had made $30 million from other Enron partnerships, increased concern about Enron's accounting and helped spark the final collapse.
     ""What little we know about Enron to date suggests that the 3 percent rule is inadequate and certainly seems to have been the cover under which some pretty egregious things went on,'' said Damon Silvers, associate general counsel at the AFL-CIO, which has more than $400 million invested in member benefit funds. ``The potential that this had to essentially warp a company's balance sheet was not something we were aware of until Enron.''

'Mind-Boggling'

     Previous efforts to tighten regulations on off-balance-sheet financing met resistance from accounting firms and companies who said the proposals were impractical. Now Andersen is being sued by shareholders and creditors and investigated by Congress and the Justice Department for its role in Enron's collapse.
     ""Contingent liability risk got the accounting firms' attention,'' said Glenn Reynolds, chief executive officer of Creditsights, an independent credit-research company. ""There's a mind-boggling amount of stuff that FASB has been debating and it's clear there are vested interests all over the place, but now the accounting firms are all worried about getting sued so they'll get behind the change.''
     SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt, who met recently with FASB President Jenkins to discuss the issue, said the commission will tighten rules on disclosure of special purpose entities. SEC regulators tell companies what to report in public filings, while FASB controls the accounting rules. President George W. Bush on Monday said corporations must be required to make ""full disclosure of liabilities'' to prevent another Enron.

Law Firm Hagens Berman Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against Enron
2002-01-31 13:56 (New York)

HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 31, 2002-- 
Enron Employees File Class Action Citing 
Phantom Stock Compensation Scheme 

   In a class-action lawsuit filed today, Enron employees charge that former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, Andersen LLP and other Enron executives negligently misrepresented the value of Enron stock when the energy trading company offered employees the option of converting salary and bonuses into Enron stock through a ""phantom stock program."" 
   The suit, filed in Texas District Court, is on behalf of thousands of Enron employees nationwide who opted to receive the phantom stock payments from the now-bankrupt energy trading company. 
   According to Steve Berman, the attorney representing the plaintiffs, both Enron and its accounting firm, Andersen LLP, played a role in the phantom stock plan, which encouraged employees to accept payment for salary and bonuses in stock that Enron and Andersen knew was wildly overvalued. 
   ""By convincing Enron employees to accept payment in stock, the defendants knew they weren't treating their employees fairly,"" Berman said. ""Enron was touting the stock as a solid investment, but we intend to prove those same Enron executives and their auditor knew the stock value was built on a shaky foundation."" 
   The suit claims Andersen's chief auditor David Duncan repeatedly certified financial statements he knew were false in an attempt to cover debts and losses, while Enron CEO Kenneth Lay knowingly used that false information to promote the overvalued Enron stock to employees to secure their loyalty and to have stock holdings available as a tool to fend off any hostile takeovers. 
   The suit makes several claims of wrongdoing by Andersen and its chief auditor, David B. Duncan, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, Director Jeffrey Skilling, CFO Andrew Fastow, Managing Director Michael Kopper and Executive Vice President Richard Causey, including: 
 
   --  Negligence: According to the suit, Andersen and Duncan failed 
        to exercise a degree of care and skill in performing audits. 
        Those audits, which the plaintiffs relied on, were seriously 
        flawed. 
   --  Negligent Misrepresentation: The suit claims that the 
        defendants made material false representations to the 
        plaintiffs including those statements in prospectuses, annual 
        reports, press releases, SEC filings, and other documents. Lay 
        and other defendants continually referred to the strength of 
        Enron's financial condition in encouraging employees to accept 
        stock as compensation and to further invest in Enron. 
   --  Violation of Texas Business and Commercial Code: The suit 
        contends that the defendants' dissemination of false and 
        misleading financial information was a deceptive practice, and 
        those statements had the capacity to -- and did -- deceive 
        plaintiffs. 
   --  Civil Conspiracy: The suit states that defendant David Duncan, 
        Andersen's chief auditor on the Enron account, conspired with 
        the others to repeatedly certify financial statements that he 
        knew to be false or misleading. The suit also contends that 
        Duncan ordered the destruction of documents regarding the 
        Enron Corporation. Concurrently, other Enron executives, fully 
        aware of the improprieties, repeatedly urged employee 
        participants to purchase Enron stock, and assured employees 
        that Enron stock was underpriced and that the company had 
        bright prospects. 
 
   The named plaintiffs in the suit, Illinois resident Michael McCown and Texas resident Dan Schultz, both received several phantom stock bonus awards while employed at Enron, the suit states. This suit is in addition to the suit filed earlier by Hagens Berman on behalf of Enron employees against Andersen and others alleging violations of RICO. 
   On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the company was taking non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after taxes in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a portion of the charge was related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by Enron's CFO, and the company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly.

As Enron Searches for Auditor, Some Big Names Don't Apply
By JONATHAN D. GLATER, New York Times
January 31, 2002
Firing its old auditor was easy. Now, with Arthur Andersen out of the way, the Enron Corporation faces a much more difficult task: finding another accounting firm willing to take its place.
Two of the other four large accounting firms said they did not intend to compete for the account of Enron, now embroiled in one of the largest accounting scandals in history. The remaining two - Deloitte & Touche and KPMG - would not comment. That may mean that a much smaller firm will have to wade through the complex, re- stated and much-criticized finances at Enron, even as lawsuits against the company - and against Andersen - pile up and creditors demand a speedy resolution of Enron's bankruptcy proceedings.
Enron has only just begun the process of finding and hiring a new auditor, having fired Andersen two weeks ago after the accounting firm said that its employees shredded Enron-related documents. If that were not enough to deter auditors, Enron's finances are - now, anyway - infamously complex; sophisticated and undisclosed transactions hid much of Enron's debt and contributed to the company's collapse into bankruptcy last month.
""We are confident that we will find a highly qualified auditor,"" said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron. She added that Enron would probably not take out advertisements to solicit applications from accountants but would contact potential auditors directly.
But a company as big as Enron needs a big accounting firm, and the biggest firms do not want to go near Enron, at least for a while. Those that have not been directly implicated in the scandal caused by Enron's implosion do not want to risk being tarred by it now.
""It's a hot potato,"" said Arthur W. Bowman, editor of Bowman's Accounting Report. ""The risk, I guess, is still high, but you would think that whatever results would fall on Andersen's shoulders.
""But you can sue anybody for anything,"" he added.
That may be why executives at the remaining four members of the so- called Big Five accounting firms do not sound eager to take on this particular client.
""We do not intend to do the audit for Enron,"" David Nestor, a spokesman for PricewaterhouseCoopers, said in an interview last week.
Ernst & Young is already advising Enron in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, said Lawrence J. Parnell, director of public relations at the firm. Is Ernst & Young considering applying to become Enron's auditor? ""Not to my knowledge,"" he said.
A spokesman for Deloitte & Touche, which is advising the judge overseeing Enron's bankruptcy proceedings, would not comment on the possibility of auditing Enron.
KPMG appeared to leave the window open a crack to the possibility of stepping into Andersen's shoes. ""We would not discuss business we were bidding for, one way or the other,"" a spokesman said.
Lawyers for Enron said that a new auditor would be subject to review by creditors and approval by the bankruptcy court. If Enron were to be liquidated rather than reorganized, the need for an auditor would diminish, said Martin J. Bienenstock, a lawyer at Weil Gotshal & Manges, which is representing Enron.
So far, Mr. Bienenstock said no ""beauty contests"" had been scheduled to let accounting firms compete for the Enron audit. At some point an auditor will have to be found because federal law requires that publicly traded companies put out audited financial statements and Enron is still publicly traded, even if its stock has been kicked off the New York Stock Exchange. In over-the-counter trading, the stock, which traded for $80 a year ago, now fetches less than 50 cents.
If none of the Big Five firms are willing to audit Enron, the company could turn to a smaller firm. But most such firms cannot devote hundreds of accountants to a single client, and Enron would require significant manpower.
""I'm going to guess that Enron had over a thousand Andersen people working on jobs,"" Mr. Bowman said, adding that many firms could not provide such a large work force.
Smaller accounting firms can collaborate on large accounts, but such relationships are complicated, said Clarence D. Hein, managing partner of Hein + Associates, which has offices in Colorado, California and - conveniently - Texas. The firm has about 120 accountants.
""We've never put together that large of an audit relationship,"" Mr. Hein said. ""That's something we'd really have to look at.""
Auditing a company with a history of reportedly questionable accounting would be a risky endeavor because bankruptcy proceedings and lawsuits would affect valuations of Enron assets, he said.
B.D.O. Seidman, with $420 million in revenue and about 2,000 employees in the United States, could probably handle an audit of Enron, but a spokesman declined to talk about the idea.
Ms. Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, was undeterred when told of accounting firms' reluctance to tackle or even comment on the prospect of tackling the company's tangled finances.
""We will find an auditor,"" she said.


Cooper says Enron can be fixed 
By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 7:44 PM ET Jan. 30, 2002

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Enron's interim CEO said Wednesday a turnaround is achievable, and he also believes he can convince the bankrupt energy company's creditors that a reorganization is more to their benefit than a liquidation.
One day after taking the helm, acting Chief Executive Stephen Cooper said in a news conference that he plans to ""spend little to zero of my time"" on what happened in the past at Enron. ""It's literally of no interest to me."" 
Although his turnaround-consulting firm, Zolfo Cooper, has had to liquidate companies, Cooper said that the firm's ""track record relative to successful reorganization is second-to-none in North America.""
Houston-based Enron named Cooper interim chief executive and chief restructuring officer on Tuesday, replacing founder Ken Lay, who resigned under pressure last week.
Cooper said the findings from Enron's internal review examining the collapse of the company should be released in the next 3 to 6 days.
While declining to offer specifics, Cooper vowed the restructuring would move at ""lightning"" pace.
He used the news conference to outline why he believes Enron is a good candidate for reorganization.
Adequate liquidity
""My sense is that Enron has a tremendous organization, and the people appear to be bright, dedicated and hard-working,"" Cooper said. ""No. 2, this company has some tremendous businesses with strong leadership positions in the markets they serve. Revenue, EBITDA and cash flow is predictable, and we have a loyal and solid customer base. We have more than adequate liquidity to support a reorganization.""
Enron didn't disclose how much cash it has on hand but it expects to generate more through asset sales and operations, and it can use debtor-in-possession financing as a backup. The DIP financing, once estimated at $1.5 billion, is now expected to be substantially smaller because of the positive cash flow in the company, a spokesman said. 
Cooper did not rule out having more layoffs, but said he would attempt to keep as many jobs as possible.
""This will certainly be a smaller company, but it will be based on hard assets with predictable revenue and cash flows,"" he said. ""This business was driven, in all candor, by a trading activity we no longer have.""
Enron has about $40 billion in consolidated debt, with about $10 billion tied to project financings. The majority of the rest is unsecured. Under bankruptcy protection, Enron will only have to repay a portion of their obligations. 
He said he had ""no idea"" how much creditors would recover, but he acknowledged some of them would be treated ""differently"" from others. He was not more specific, but typically in bankruptcy, certain claims take precedence over others.
""Our creditors are astute, economic analysts, and we will have a good opportunity to convince them that the best return and recovery is through a reorganization,"" Cooper said. ""I believed that coming in and I believe it today.
""My view historically...is that you can effectuate a successful restructuring that delivers more value to stakeholders than you do through a liquidation.""

Calif Davis To FERC: Probe Possible Enron Mkt Manipulation

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday asked the nation's top energy regulator to investigate possible market manipulation by Enron Corp. (ENE) during the state's energy crisis last year. 
""I am extremely concerned about revelations made in the past few days concerning possible manipulation of energy prices in the Enron Corporation,"" wrote Davis in a letter to the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Patrick Wood.
On Tuesday, Wood testified before the U.S. Senate Energy Committee about the bankrupt energy giant's impact on the nation's energy markets, and said he was willing to look into allegations that the company inflated power prices in the Northwest. 
On Monday, U.S. Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., wrote a letter to the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee asking that he investigate Enron's role in the state's power crisis, which drove up wholesale electricity prices, caused blackouts and financially devastated two utilities.

USA: US energy regulator joins increasing Enron probes.
By Chris Baltimore

01/31/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Federal energy regulators said they launched an investigation on Thursday into allegations that bankrupt Enron Corp unfairly boosted wholesale power prices during California's electricity crisis last year. 
The probe was demanded by West Coast Democrats, who contend that the Houston-based firm manipulated wholesale prices to boost its profits at the expense of California residents. The California power crisis unleashed a series of blackouts and forced the state to spend billions of dollars to buy power when utilities could no longer afford to do so.
Enron, until recently the world's biggest energy trader, has denied any wrongdoing. 
Pat Wood, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, told Reuters that his staff on Thursday began examining the allegations of price manipulation by Enron. 
""Staff is looking at it today,"" Wood said after addressing a FERC-sponsored conference in New York on power supplies in Northeastern states. 
The investigation is a ""joint effort"" between FERC's office of general counsel and office of market tariffs and rates, he said. He declined to elaborate on the scope of the probe. 
Wood, a Texas Republican, was appointed FERC chairman last summer by President George W. Bush with the support of Enron. Democrats have raised questions about Bush's close ties to Enron and its top executives, who were big contributors to Bush's presidential campaign. 
CALIFORNIA DEMANDS REFUNDS 
Enron was among a dozen power generators which were major players in California's wholesale electricity market. 
Prices for power sold on the state's spot market rose tenfold in the autumn of 2000 and continued at high levels through spring of 2001. The sharp increase was blamed on California's failed deregulation law, which failed to encourage the construction of new power plants and barred utilities from passing through higher wholesale costs to consumers. 
The state of California is demanding some $9 billion in refunds for alleged overcharges by Enron and several other power generators during the crisis. The case is pending before a FERC administrative law judge with no decision expected for several months. 
Democratic Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Maria Cantwell of Washington prodded Wood at a Senate Energy Committee hearing earlier this week to look into any wrongdoing by Enron. 
The lawmakers pointed to a study by an independent consultant showing that California wholesale electricity prices fell by 30 percent immediately after Enron declared bankruptcy in December. 
Feinstein said a ""key factor"" in higher power prices was Enron's ability to deal in unregulated financial derivatives in the natural gas market while controlling a large share of the market. Natural gas is widely used in California to fuel electricity generating plants. 
ALL FERC MEMBERS SUPPORT PROBE 
The FERC probe into Enron's role in California power prices joins more than a half-dozen other investigations into various aspects of the company's spectacular collapse. 
Several House and Senate panels are looking at Enron's complex financial accounting practices, its relationship with accounting firm Andersen, and potential securities fraud. The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Labor Department and the Justice Department also have separate probes. 
There was a consensus among the three other FERC commissioners, who were also at the New York power meeting, that an investigation of Enron was warranted. 
""I am perfectly happy to do a California investigation,"" said Nora Brownell, a Republican appointed to FERC last year. 
Brownell's nomination to FERC was endorsed by Enron, which supported her open market approach as a Pennsyvlania utilities regulator. 
William Massey and Linda Breathitt, Democratic commissioners appointed during the Clinton administration, told Reuters they also supported a probe of Enron. 
""I think that when there is evidence of increased volatility that arises in correlation with particular events in the market, we ought to take a look,"" Massey said.

Fund to assist ex-Enron employees collects $396,000 in a week
By LISA FALKENBERG

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - One of the funds to help laid-off Enron Corp. workers has taken in more than $396,000 in the past week, primarily from politicians and political groups donating campaign contributions they received from the energy giant before it filed for bankruptcy. 
The Enron Employee Transition Fund, one of several funds helping ex-Enron employees, was established a week ago by the Greater Houston Community Foundation, which provided the initial $50,000.
Major donors include Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. More than 20 elected officials from across the nation have sent checks ranging from $500 to Hutchison's $100,000, the transition fund said Thursday. 
The money will be sent to United Way agencies, which will provide direct services to some of the 4,500 Enron workers laid off in December. 
At first, the fund will focus on helping employees transition to new jobs by offering counseling and assistance dealing with bill collectors, including mortgage companies, landlords and utilities. 
A smaller portion will be used to provide workers with direct assistance to pay for bills and other expenses. 
Another fund, set up by a former Enron employee, has taken in about $160,000. The Enron Ex-Employee Relief Fund distributed 30 checks to help Enron employees last week and hoped to distribute 50 more Thursday, said founder Rebekah Rushing, who found work at another Houston energy firm. 
In all, the fund has given out more than $100,000 to help the laid-off employees pay bills while they look for other jobs, Rushing said. Some of biggest donations have come from Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee 
Rushing said she has approached other funds about consolidating the Enron relief effort. 
""My concern is the people need assistance now,"" said Rushing, who has 400 ex-Enron employees on her waiting list for assistance. ""If we work together, we're able to provide more assistance."" 
Rushing's fund is in the process of earning a designation that allows charitable donations to be tax deductible.

WSJ: Barclays Cap Hires Enron's Joseph Gold, Richard Lewis
By Erik Portanger

Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Barclays Capital, the investment banking unit of British bank Barclays PLC (BCS), has hired two former executives from Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) Enron Europe to run a newly-created energy trading team.
The bank said it has appointed Joseph Gold as head of power and gas trading in continental Europe, and Richard Lewis as its U.K. trading head. Both will report to Benoit de Vitry, head of commodities at Barclays Capital. They are expected eventually to lead a team of up to 25 power and gas traders. 
Gold was formerly President and CEO of Enron Metals, which was sold earlier this week to Sempra Energy Trading, a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy (SRE) for $145 million. Lewis, meanwhile, previously served as managing director of Enron Europe's power and gas activities.

DESTRUCTION OF ENRON AUDIT DOCUMENTS
C.E. ANDREWS

02/24/2002
Congressional Testimony by Federal Document Clearing House
(Copyright 2002 by Federal Document Clearing House, Inc.)

January 24, 2002 
Statement of C.E. Andrews Global Managing Partner -Assurance and Business Advisory
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Committee on Energy and Commerce 
U.S. House of Representatives 
C. E. Andrews is managing partner for Andersen's global audit practice. Dorsey L. Baskin, Jr. is Managing Director of Andersen's Assurance Professional Standards Group, which has firm-wide responsibility for providing guidance on auditing standards, including professional standards relating to the preservation of audit work papers and client files. 
We would like to make two essential points at the outset of our testimony. First, this Committee and the broader public should know that Andersen came forward voluntarily and disclosed the destruction of documents by Andersen personnel. However improper that destruction was, Andersen did not hide from its obligation to do what it could to take corrective action; we promptly alerted all investigative authorities, including this Committee. Although the firm was well aware of the potentially devastating impact this disclosure could have on our reputation, we did the right thing. We certainly are not proud of the document destruction - but we are proud of our decision to step forward and accept responsibility. 
Second, it bears emphasis that Andersen has cooperated fully and unreservedly with all of the ongoing investigations into the destruction of Enron-related documents. We are determined to get to the bottom of what happened. And we will take whatever decisive action is necessary to restore public confidence in the firm. 
The Committee is holding this hearing at an extraordinary time. The circumstances surrounding the collapse of Enron are now being investigated by myriad committees and subcommittees of Congress, including this Committee; the House Financial Services Subcommittee; the Senate Commerce Committee; the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee; and the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. 
In addition, of course, investigations are being conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission; the U.S. Department of Justice; and the U.S. Department of Labor. 
And not least, Andersen is conducting its own inquiry into all of the circumstances of the Enron audit, including the destruction of documents by Andersen personnel. This is not a face-saving exercise on our part. It is absolutely essential to Andersen's continued success that there be a thorough, entirely credible determination of what happened and what went wrong. We know that our reputation is our single most important asset - and the one on which our firm's existence is premised. We therefore are determined to get to the bottom of what happened, to publicly acknowledge and correct any errors that we made, and to take all actions that are necessary to ensure that such mistakes do not recur in the future. 
The proof of our commitment to a thorough and transparent response to the events at Enron is visible in the steps that we already have taken. Andersen's CEO, Joe Berardino, testified before the a House committee in December and acknowledged that Andersen auditors made an error in judgment regarding the Enron audit. As we'll explain in more detail later, we likewise have acknowledged that the destruction of documents by the Enron engagement team was wrong, and we have taken forceful steps in response. 
Our commitment also is manifest in the full cooperation that we have given to all of the official inquiries into Enron's collapse. While others whose assistance has been sought by investigators have not cooperated and were nowhere to be seen at previous congressional hearings, we have answered every question put to us and appeared whenever requested. Although this is a very painful time for our firm and the questions are sometimes difficult to answer, Joe Berardino and C.E. Andrews each testified before congressional committees last month. Mr. Berardino has addressed issues raised by the press, and he and Andersen's other top executives have tried to respond fully and honestly to the concerns both of our clients and of the tens of thousands of Andersen partners and employees who had no connection at all to the Enron audit. 
We have, moreover, gone the extra mile in cooperating with the governmental investigations: 
-We have made diligent efforts to provide all relevant materials to investigative bodies; to accommodate this Committee, for example, we produced a substantial volume of material on a significantly expedited basis. 
- We gave the Committee the names of Andersen personnel who have knowledge about events relating to Enron, including document destruction, and, to the extent possible, encouraged these individuals to cooperate with the Committee's requests for interviews. We did not object to the testimony of any Andersen personnel with direct knowledge relevant to the inquiry, including Ms. Nancy Temple. 
We have provided briefings to congressional staff on Enron accounting issues and, to the extent we are able, on matters relating to the destruction of documents. 
We have invested incalculable man hours responding to governmental requests for documents and information. 
Finally, to assure that we resolve all issues relating to the destruction of documents in a manner that is beyond reproach, we retained former Sen. John Danforth and his law firm to review Andersen's document retention policies and, ultimately, to ensure that Andersen takes all appropriate disciplinary action against personnel involved in improper document destruction. 
Our investigation into the destruction of documents by Andersen personnel is far from complete. We nevertheless will endeavor to be as helpful and forthcoming as possible - although we must add the caveat that there may well be questions that neither we, nor anyone else at Andersen, will be able to answer at this time to the Committee's satisfaction. 
This is what we can tell you about Andersen's retention and destruction of documents. 
To begin with, it is the usual, routine, and wholly legitimate practice of auditors to preserve their final work papers while disposing of drafts, personal notes, and other materials that are not necessary to support the audit report. So far as we are aware, this is the policy of all large audit firms. 
This policy towards document disposal reflects sound audit practice. It is designed to assure that the audit work papers -which are the principal materials reflecting and documenting the conclusions of the audit - unambiguously reflect the judgments that actually were reached. To this end, auditors routinely dispose of preliminary or draft documents that might create confusion about the auditor's analysis or conclusions. It is the audit work papers, rather than preliminary materials, that are the real evidence of how the audit proceeded. 
Generally Accepted Auditing Standards, commonly referred to by their initials as GAAS, provide guidance on the purpose and nature of documentation retained by auditors. The applicable general standard, Section 339 of the codification of audit standards, provides that auditors should keep for a period of time their working papers that support their reports. 
The standard provides that the purpose of working papers is to: (a) provide the principal support for the audit report, including the reference in the report to compliance with GAAS; and (b) aid the auditor in the conduct and supervision of the audit. Work papers consist of many different types of documents, including schedules and details of account balances; memoranda relating to business and financial reporting risks and management controls; work programs that direct the staff in the procedures and tests to be performed and that may document the results thereof; documentation of procedures and tests such as confirmations of accounts receivable; records of counts of inventory; results of tests of the operation of controls as the audit progresses; conclusions reached as the result of tests; a copy of the entity's financial statements signed by management to evidence its responsibility for the final presentation; memoranda related to any accounting and audit issues that arose during the audit, including conclusions reached; representation letters from management; and a copy of the final audit report. 
In addition to these period-specific documents, auditors generally keep continuing or ""evergreen"" files that contain documents of use to audits for more than one year. Examples of these documents would be copies of loan agreements, charters, organization charts, and so on. Auditors also keep client-relationship files that contain records of billing for fees and other administrative matters. The client-relationship files are not considered to be part of the work papers because they do not contain audit evidence relating to the audit report. 
According to the section 339 of GAAS, many factors affect the auditor's judgment about the quantity, type, and content of the work papers for a particular engagement, including: (a) the nature of the engagement; (b) the nature of the auditor's report; (c) the nature of the financial statements, schedules, or other information on which the auditor is reporting; (d) the nature and condition of the client's records; (e) the assessed level of control risk; and (f) the needs in the particular circumstances for supervision and review of the work. 
The January 2002 revision of section 339 of GAAS adds to the standard that audit documentation should be sufficient to: (a) enable members of the engagement team with supervision and review responsibilities to understand the nature, timing, extent and results of auditing procedures performed and the evidence obtained; (b) indicate the engagement team member(s) who performed and reviewed the work; and (c) show that the accounting records agree or reconcile with the financial statements or other information being reported on. 
Section 339 of GAAS provides that the auditor should adopt reasonable procedures for safeguarding work papers and should retain them for a period sufficient to meet the needs of the auditor's practice and to satisfy any pertinent legal requirements of records retention. 
Typically the work papers for the previous year's audit are checked out at the beginning of the next audit by the engagement team and used as a source of information during the next audit. Thereafter, the work papers tend to sit in storage for many years. 
This understanding of proper audit practice was reflected in the Andersen document retention policy in effect last fall, which provided that documents other than work papers ordinarily should be disposed of when no longer needed - but that such documents should be retained when litigation has commenced or is threatened. Precisely when that occurs often will require the application of informed judgment to the particular circumstances of a given case, and that may well be a point on which reasonable people can differ. It also may be a point that looks quite different in hindsight than it did to people making decisions at the time. 
Looking at this policy now, in light of recent events and with the benefit of hindsight, we have to say that it is not a model of clarity - although our guess is that, if the document retention policies of other large businesses were subjected to the same close scrutiny, they likely also would reveal ambiguities and questions about their application to particular cases. 
As we mentioned, we are still investigating the destruction of Enron-related documents by Andersen personnel, and there is much still to learn. But we can say this much about what we know about the destruction of Enron-related documents. On October 17 the SEC requested information from Enron about its financial accounting and reporting. Several days later, on October 23, David Duncan, Andersen's lead partner on the Enron engagement, called an urgent meeting of the Enron engagement team at which he organized an expedited effort to shred or otherwise dispose of Enron-related documents. This effort was undertaken without any consultation with others in the firm or, so far as we are aware, with legal counsel. 
Over the course of the next several days, a very substantial volume of documents and emails - involving many of the Enron-related materials that ultimately were destroyed - were disposed of by the Enron engagement team, including Mr. Duncan. So far as we have been able to determine to date, however, no audit work papers were destroyed. 
This activity appears to have stopped shortly after Mr. Duncan's assistant sent an e-mail to other secretaries on November 9 - the day after Andersen received a subpoena from the SEC - telling them ""no more shredding."" 
Enron-related documents also were destroyed by others at the firm, although the volume and circumstances of their activities appear to have been quite different from those of Mr. Duncan. We are continuing our investigation into that aspect of these events. 
On Friday, January 4 - shortly after the firm's internal inquiry informed Andersen's CEO about the document destruction - Andersen voluntarily notified the Department of Justice and the SEC. On January 7, Andersen met with Justice Department and SEC attorneys and briefed them on what we knew. On January 10, Andersen also disclosed the destruction to all relevant congressional committees and to the public. At the same time, the firm suspended its records management policy, asking Sen. Danforth to conduct an immediate and comprehensive review of that policy and to recommend improvements. 
On January 15, approximately two weeks after our CEO learned about the document destruction, Andersen dismissed Mr. Duncan, the lead engagement partner. The firm also placed three other partners from the Enron engagement on administrative leave pending completion of the investigation into their responsibility for these events. The firm relieved four partners in its Houston office of their management responsibilities. And the firm indicated that it will take disciplinary action against any Andersen personnel who are found to have acted improperly. Anyone at Andersen who purposely destroyed work papers, or who destroyed Enron-related documents after having been informed of the Nov. 8 subpoena to Andersen, will be dismissed; discipline for other improper conduct will depend on the nature and severity of the acts involved. 
Finally, as we have mentioned, Andersen retained Sen. Danforth and his firm to ensure that all appropriate steps are taken to deal internally with misconduct by Andersen personnel. 
We should address the question why Andersen took the forceful action it did regarding Mr. Duncan. In our view, Mr. Duncan's actions reflected a failure of judgment that is simply unacceptable in a person who has major responsibilities at our firm. He was the lead engagement partner for a significant client, exercising very substantial responsibility within the firm. Yet our investigation indicated that he directed the purposeful destruction of a very substantial volume of documents - and in doing so, he gave every appearance of destroying these materials in anticipation of a government request for documents. This is the kind of conduct that Andersen cannot tolerate. 
The case of Mr. Duncan was clear enough to allow us to draw conclusions about his responsibility at an early stage of the inquiry. That is not true of other Andersen personnel who were involved with the destruction of documents. Our investigation continues; persons who are found to have acted inappropriately, whatever their position in the firm, will be dealt with accordingly. 
Let me conclude by noting that when Joe Berardino testified almost six weeks ago, he ended his remarks by stating that ""[a] day does not go by without new information being made available and I would observe that all of us here today - and many others who are not here - have a responsibility to seek out and evaluate the facts and take needed action."" We have tried to fulfill that responsibility. We uncovered the document destruction; our firm's management brought it to the attention of the governmental authorities; we already have started to implement decisive disciplinary and remedial action; and we are continuing our investigation, resolved to take all steps that are necessary to restore public confidence in the integrity of our firm. 
This is, of course, a very painful and difficult period for Andersen. But Andersen's great strength is its 85,000 employees in 84 countries around the world; its 28,000 Andersen personnel in the United States contribute to the economic life of virtually State in the Union. We are determined to respond to this test openly and with complete candor, and to face up honestly to our responsibilities to our clients and to the public. 
Thank you.

DESTRUCTION OF ENRON AUDIT DOCUMENTS
EDWARD J. MARKEY

02/24/2002
Congressional Testimony by Federal Document Clearing House
(Copyright 2002 by Federal Document Clearing House, Inc.)

JANUARY 24, 2002 
OPENING STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE EDWARD J. MARKEY (D-MA)
OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE 
HEARING ON DESTRUCTION OF ENRON-RELATED DOCUMENTS OF ARTHUR ANDERSON PERSONNEL THURSDAY, 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for extending to me the courtesy of participating in today's hearing. 
I think it is outrageous that the same executives who may be responsible for the destruction of workers' pensions -- and the destruction of documents that might prove their guilt -- are currently protected by Congress when defrauded worker's actually try to recover their life savings. But, sadly, it is true. Why? Because in 1995, Arthur Anderson and the other big accounting firms succeeded in lobbying Congress to strictly limit their future liability for securities fraud. That bill passed over the President's veto as part of the Republican Contract with America. And today, we are seeing the grim results -- Arthur Anderson can no longer be held jointly and severally liable when a court has found them guilty of securities fraud. I believe that this ill-advised law has directly contributed to a rising tide of accounting failures, culminating in the Enron-Arthur Anderson fiasco. The types of internal checks and balances that a healthy concern about litigation risk used to create within each accounting firm has been undermined. The many honest and decent people who want to do the right thing get overruled, and the increasing revenues coming from consulting and non-audit businesses put growing pressure to sign off on the `cooked books' of major clients. 
Yesterday, I introduced legislation aimed helping to address this problem. This bill would, among other things, require auditors to retain copies of all documents generated during the course of an audit for a period of four years and establish criminal penalties of up to ten years imprisonment for auditors that knowingly and willfully destroy such documents. The bill also would reform the liability standards applicable to accountants in securities fraud cases and provide an exemption from the ""Catch 22"" discovery stay that allows accounting firms to escape accountability for their actions. I look forward to working with Members on this and other reforms. Clearly, we have a system that is very broken, and we need to work together to fix it. 
Today's hearing is focused on the disturbing reports that employees of Arthur Anderson have destroyed documents in connection with the Enron debacle. I think it's appalling that Anderson CEO Joseph Berardino has declined the Subcommittee's invitation to testify on this matter, when he was somehow able to make an appearance on Meet the Press last Sunday. I have also read that Mr. Berardino has agreed to appear before the House Financial Services Committee on February 4th. If Mr. Berardino can appear to answer questions on national television and before other Committees, it seems to me that he should be able to appear before this Subcommittee so that we can get to the bottom of why his firm destroyed documents being sought by the SEC, by the Justice Department, and by defrauded workers and investors. 
Now, I have many questions about the underlying transactions and investments whose accounting treatment helped to bring Enron to bankruptcy, but I understand that this is not the subject of today's hearing. I would merely hope, Mr. Chairman, that we will have a chance to thoroughly examine Enron's investments in broadband, its energy trading operations, and its derivatives and other structured financings in the detail needed to understand just what happened here and what lessons we can learn from this massive fraud and misbehavior. That will require more than a single hearing of all of the principals to do properly. 
Thanks again, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to participate in today's hearing. I look forward to the testimony.

Jeanie,

I know I am probably becoming a pain in the butt about this ESOP clerical error issue but I would like to get this wrapped up before we go to UBS.  I do not believe that I will get any attention after I am no longer an Enron employee.  Should I contact Robert Jones directly?

"FW: Tom Martin's ESOP","Mr. Martin,

I wanted to take a moment this morning to provide you an update on your recent ESOP change request.  I have received confirmation from Corporate Benefits that your form has been received.  Unfortunately due to current switch over of our Savings vendor, which was also the vendor for our ESOP program, we are still experimenting the blackout period on any savings plan activity through November 20th.  

Also, I wanted to point out my error with the processing of your form.  Since this was a very old stock program form, I accidentally confused it for an enrollment form to our direct service program, which is the program that allows employees to purchase stock through payroll deduction twice a month.  In a nutshell, I accidentally forwarded your form to the incorrect resource and then had to re-route it to the correct group which is our corporate contact for the 401(K) savings plan.  

I apologize for the delay in providing you with this update and am extremely sorry for my mistake.   Please let me know if there is anything that I can do asides from following up with Corporate benefits after the blackout period to check on the status of your request and then I will provide your asst, Laura with an update. 

Thanks.

Assistants: Please be ready to submit a churn on this Friday 10/5/01 for your individual groups (I will let you know if this changes and once I am certain of the seat numbers for your groups, I will give them to you). I will also need to give you your mail stop locations at the new building, which I am working on now with the mailroom.  In the meantime, from now till we move, please start cleaning up your areas and your groups areas and discarding anything that isn't needed.  It has been requested that only 6 boxes per person be moved because space is limited.  So we need to decide what can be sent to archives.  I will send you some forms for this. Please come to me with any questions.

Deskheads:  Unless, there is any changes from the office of the chair, I will set up a meeting with each one of you on Thursday to make sure you have no changes to your seating.  Once the churn is submitted there can not be any changes other than new additions to the group or deletions from the group.  This is to prevent there being any mixups when installing equipment at the new building.

Lyne,
My name is Mark Bain and I'm the Web Site Adminstrator for the Mariners.  I
would be glad to help out in any way. Please pass this email and my phone
numbers (281-379-6896 hm. 281-518-3251 wk.) to your website person.  I put
alot of info in this email to help get started but if it is a little
overwhelming, just call.
A previous board member, Steve Burleigh, created our web site last year and
gave me alot of ideas. For this year, I found a web site called eTeamZ that
hosts web sites for sports groups.  Check out our new page:
http://www.eteamz.com/swimmariners/
eTeamsZ is really easy to use and does not require much web site knowledge.
They do the formatting and you supply the info.  If your web guru wants to
get creative, they can do some custome stuff as well.  The best part,
however, is that it is FREE.  Of course with free you have to put up with a
little advertising but since this site is tailor made for sports (meet
schedules, practice schedules calendars, news, maps, etc.) , I think it is
worth it.
If you don't decide to use eTeamZ, that's fine too.  I've created some other
web sites and should be able to answer some questions.  Sounds like you have
some experience so it should be no problem.  Good luck and let me know what
else you need.
eTeamZ TIPS:
Oh, here are some tips on getting started with eTeamZ.  (difficulties that I
had anyway):
Registration- http://www.eteamz.com/company/sites/register/
The toughest part was coming up with a nickname and a user name for the
websites.  Seems that most of the users are into baseball and Mariners was
taken.  I think I used Mariners Swim Team for nickname and goMariners for
the username because I kept hitting other name that were being used.
WebSite- When I got to the ""build you web"" page, I chose Team Web Site.
They also had options for Leagues and Orgs.
My best advice is to start populating things via the admin page and bring up
another windows to check the progress of what is actually displayed.
PLUS - They have a premium service called PLUS that you pay for but I didn't
see much use for it except you get rid of some of the advertising banners.
They also show that you can use this site for registration and other things
but we are keeping it pretty simple.

Cindy,
Oak Creek is wanting to start their own web page.  We had looked at the
Memorial Chase page last year and were very impressed by what you all had
done with it.  Is there someone at Memorial Chase that was involved with
setting up your web page that might be willing to answer a few questions for
us?  We have a board member that is familiar with how to set it up, but I
thought it might be beneficial for them to talk to someone that had done the
same thing for a NWAL team before they go much furthur.  Thanks for your
help.

Enron to Scale Back European Operations, But Says It Won't Cut U.S. Payrolls

10/04/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Christina Cheddar 
Dow Jones Newswires
NEW YORK -- Although Enron Corp. plans to scale back its European operations, the Houston energy-trading company isn't looking to pare U.S. payrolls. 
""There's nothing out of (the) ordinary planned for the rest of the business,"" said company spokeswoman Karen Denne. ""We are continuing to hire in the businesses most rapidly growing."" 
Those growing businesses include Enron Wholesale Services, she said. 
Earlier Thursday, Dow Jones Newswires reported the company would cut between 5% to 10% of its European staff, or as many as 500 workers. 
This past summer, the energy company announced staff reductions at its Enron Broadband Services division. The number of employees affected by this decision wasn't immediately available, Ms. Denne said. 
Before Thursday's announcement, the company's shares were trading lower on the New York Stock Exchange. But in afternoon trading today, shares of Enron (ENE) were up $1.11, or 3.3% to $34.60. With these latest gains, the stock is now up about 40% from the three-year low of $24.46 set a week ago. 
For several months, Enron shares have been under pressure as investors struggled to assess the impact of a number of negative developments, including declining energy prices, the recent and sudden departure of its chief executive, disappointing performance of its broadband unit and difficulties at its Indian power plant project. 
The stock has made steady progress this week as investors shopped for bargains or were encouraged by progress Enron made in its plan to divest itself of some overseas assets. 
On Wednesday, Enron announced the sale of some Indian oil and gas assets to BG Group PLC (BRG), a United Kingdom oil and gas company. 
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin said the stock also received further support by the reaffirmation of earnings forecasts at rivals Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Aquila Inc. (ILA) in recent days.

Enron Seeks To Cut Staff In Europe By 5%-10%

10/04/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) is looking to cut its workforce in Europe by up to 10%, or around 500 jobs, Enron Europe Chief Executive John Sherriff said Thursday. 
""We have around 5,000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our headcount here by between 5% and 10%, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance,"" Sherriff replied in a written response to questions by Dow Jones Newswires.
The cuts are the first significant retrenchment by Enron since it arrived in Europe in 1989. Enron has been the most aggressive U.S. energy company to expand into Europe's deregulating markets, but its core energy trading businesses have been held back by the slow and piecemeal progress toward market liberalization in the E.U. 
The company declined to be more specific about how far it will scale back individual product lines or coverage of certain geographical businesses. 

Enron's product range in Europe has mushroomed over the past year, continually giving rise to market talk, notably among its competitors, of overstretching itself prematurely in underdeveloped markets. 
""Enron's business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth,"" Sherriff said. 
""It is prudent for us to keep both a close eye on our costs and to continually review the skills and resources that are available to use, to ensure that they are deployed in a way to maximize earnings,"" he added. 
While trading volumes have exploded in core markets such as U.K. power trading since wholesale market reforms were introduced in March, liquidity in other products such as bandwidth, monomers and credit risk, is understood to have developed more slowly and restricted the volume growth needed to justify Enron's pure trading strategy. 
Enron has been among the most prominent exponents of a new philosophy in energy markets that places far more emphasis on risk management skills than the physical ownership of assets, a radical change from the asset-heavy approach to energy that prevailed in Europe before the E.U.'s deregulation directive came into effect in 1999. 
As such, it has in the last 18 months disposed of assets such as its stake in Sutton Bridge power station in England and has conspicuously refrained from buying 'brownfield' physical assets in markets such as Italy and Germany. 
However, it has pursued various greenfield independent power projects and the acquisition of gas trading licenses in markets such as Spain and Italy.

Acquisition Speeds Select Energy's Northeast Growth-Exec
By Kristen McNamara
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/04/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Select Energy Inc.'s planned purchase of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing Inc. will speed up by a year or two the company's plans to expand its business beyond New England to the entire Northeast, Select's president said. 
The acquisition stengthens Select Energy's position in New York and the Mid-Atlantic, boosting its efforts to become a regional leader in the business of managing energy supply for industrial and commercial customers and trading electricity in the region.
""We want to be the dominant player here,"" President William Schivley said in an interview with Dow Jones Newswires. ""By being the dominant player in the Northeast, we'll be considered a national player."" 
Select, a unit of Berlin, Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities (NU), faces competition from national heavyweights like Enron Corp. (ENE), Duke Energy (DUK), AES Corp. (AES) and Exelon Corp. (EXC). 
Select Energy announced an agreement Tuesday to purchase the wholesale and retail energy sales unit of Syracuse, New York-based Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc. (NMK), which is active in the Mid-Atlantic and New York power markets. 
Integration plans aren't firm, but Select Energy will work with Niagara Mohawk executives to identify best practices from both companies, Schivley said. 
The companies aim to have a transition plan ready by the time federal energy regulators rule on the combination. Select Energy has said it plans to keep Niagara Mohawk's Syracuse office open. 
The company won't release the terms of the deal until it closes, which is expected in late November. 
Select has annual revenues of about $2.5 billion. Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing had revenues of $635 million in 2000. 
Select Energy is still looking at further acquisitions of trading operation and generating assets in New York and the Mid-Atlantic, Schivley said. 
""This is more than just window shopping,"" Schivley said. ""We are actively seeking out hard assets."" 
The company isn't interested, however, in the two other unregulated units Niagara Mohawk is looking to sell in advance of its acquisition by National Grid Group PLC (NGG), he added. 
Within the next three to five years, more and more large companies are likely to start outsourcing management of their energy needs, especially as those needs become more complicated, Schivley said. Energy, along with labor and raw materials, are companies' three biggest expenses, he said. 
""We're trying to grow this business by leaps and bounds,"" Schivley said. ""We've taken a giant step in New York. All the products we offer will be expanded dramatically and increased to a number that, without the acquisition, would have taken us a year or two to get to.""

Pacific NW Lawmakers Gear Up To Oppose FERC RTO Mandate
By Bryan Lee

10/04/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Members of the Pacific Northwest congressional delegation are gearing up in opposition to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's mandate for consolidation of power-grid assets in the region.
The House Northwest Energy Caucus held an informal hearing late Wednesday to air concerns of utilities and industrial consumers in the region about FERC's effort to establish a regional transmission organization, or RTO. 
The lawmakers plan to follow up the hearing with a letter to FERC voicing the concerns, which largely revolve around skepticism that the RTO will result in cost savings for the region's consumers. 
FERC shouldn't force an RTO on the region without first conducting a cost-benefit analysis, said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is spearheading the effort. 
Speaking with reporters prior to Wednesday's hearing, DeFazio complained that ""a bunch of bureaucrats"" at FERC are embracing the national power-grid agenda of Enron Corp. (ENE) without assessing the costs and regardless of ""what it does for local reliability."" 
DeFazio's complaints were echoed in the testimony presented at Wednesday's hearing. 
The region already enjoys an open and competitive transmission network, thanks to the federally owned Bonneville Power Administration, according to hearing testimony expressing concern that RTO West, as the RTO proposed for the region is called, will cost more to implement than it will provide in benefits. 
""We are troubled that RTO West will not achieve any net benefit for end-use consumers in the Northwest,"" the Public Power Council testified. ""Although work is beginning on a cost-benefit study, we are troubled that a transmission system that has served us all well for so long will be disassembled because FERC has announced that RTOs, by definition, are good."" 
""Regional transmission organizations may be necessary to remedy the transmission ills in other regions of the country, but not in the Northwest,"" declared a group of transmission-dependent utilities. 
""The 'balkanization' and isolation of transmission systems that characterize most other regions is simply not present in the Northwest. For this reason, the economic power-side benefits of an RTO will be relatively small,"" said a group of aluminum producers. 
Similar cost-benefit concerns have been voiced by state utility regulators in the Eastern U.S. who oppose FERC's effort to consolidate grid assets under large RTOs in the Southeast and Northeast. 
'RTO Week' 

FERC Chairman Pat Wood III acknowledged the complaints Thursday, adding that he expected to address the concerns of regulators and industry during ""RTO Week"" Oct. 15, when the commission will hold five days of hearings on the commission's RTO mandate. 
""I think I need the decisionmakers at the table. We've had the lawyers in the suits arguing about it for eight years now,"" Wood said at an ""energy community"" forum sponsored by Enron in Arlington, Va. 
Wood told Dow Jones Newswires following his remarks at the Enron forum that FERC answered the complaints about the lack of a cost-benefit analysis at its Sept. 26 meeting. 
The commission agreed to undertake a comprehensive analysis in support of its claim that RTOs will bring about operational efficiencies that will translate into consumer savings. 
Wood also noted a study by Mirant Corp. (MIR), which concluded that combining the three independent system operators in the Northeast into a single RTO would produce $440 million in annual consumer benefits. 
During the Enron forum, Edward Meyers, a regulator with the District of Columbia Public Service Commission, urged Wood to seek out the input of affected state regulators. 
Meyers noted that he is in the minority among regulators in the region in supporting the Northeast RTO grid-consolidation, while most others oppose the effort as ""economically dangerous."" 
Arnetta McRae, chairman of the Delaware Public Service Commission, told Wood that her fellow state regulators aren't so much opposed to grid regionalization but the lack of consultation by FERC. 
The state regulators want ""an opportunity to be at the table,"" McRae said. If such a process were offered, there would be a lot less opposition, she predicted. 
FERC is reaching out to address the concerns of state regulators, Wood said, adding that he was ""blindsided"" by the opposition among state regulators to FERC's grid-consolidation mandate. 
Later in the day, Wood told reporters that ""RTO Week"" will feature an entire hearing devoted to the concerns of state regulators. 
At the Enron forum, Wood defended the commission's RTO policy, which calls for carving up the nation's interconnected electricity system under the control of four or five large RTOs, as necessary to jump-start the overly long transition from regulation to competition. 
""This process needs to be goosed,"" said Wood, calling FERC's RTO orders ""an external catalyst"" to get the process moving. 
""If I'm wrong, I'd love to find a better way around that,"" he said.

USA: NewPower signs up 50,000 new electric users in Texas.

10/04/2001
Reuters English News Service

NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - The New Power Co. said Thursday the electricity grid operator in Texas is processing requests from over 50,000 residential customers who have chosen New Power as their new electricity provider. 
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is responsible for processing the requests to switch customers for all utilities and competitive retail electric service providers during the state's deregulation pilot program, NewPower said in a statement.
The switching process could take anywhere from two weeks to two months before consumers will actually begin to receive power from a competitive retail electricity provider. 
New Power said it has captured more than half of the customers who decided to switch to new providers from the Reliant Energy HL&P and TXU Corp. markets. 
The New Power Co., a subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc. , is the first national provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers in deregulated power markets in the United States. 
The Texas pilot power deregulation program began on July 31 after it was delayed two months due to computer problems. 
The entire state is slated to begin full retail competition on Jan. 1, 2002. 
A spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Texas told Reuters previously that about 120,000 residential customers had signed up for the pilot program.

States protest federal involvement in electricity competition, deregulation
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - North Carolina and several other states told the Supreme Court the government went too far when it ordered electric utilities to open their power lines to competitors and spurred a movement toward deregulation. 
But one of the country's largest power marketers, Enron, argued before the court Wednesday that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should have gone even further to help companies like Enron get equal access to power grids.
During the hourlong hearing, the justices gave little indication of how they will decide on a case that could dramatically affect management of the nation's power grids and the future of electricity competition. 
At one point, Justice Stephen Breyer said FERC, which regulates wholesale power markets and interstate transmission of power, was being ""whipsawed"" from both directions. 
The commission's 1996 decision, which for the first time required traditional utilities to open their transmission lines to competing power merchants, triggered a movement toward wholesale electricity competition and led numerous states to end monopolies in retail power markets. 
But utility regulators in nine states, led by New York, filed suit arguing that the FERC order amounts to a federal agency attempting to regulate retail sales, usurping a traditional state function. 
At the same time, Enron's lawsuit charged that FERC violated federal law because it did not require access to transmission lines when utilities continued to keep transmission and retail sales as one operation - as remains the case in many states that have yet to allow competition. 
In June 2000, an appellate court essentially upheld FERC's regulation, prompting appeals from both Enron and the state regulators. 
""It's an example of where an agency has overstepped its bounds,"" Lawrence Malone, general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission, told the justices at Wednesday's hearing. The other states party to the lawsuit are Florida, Idaho, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, Vermont and Wyoming. 
Malone, appearing on behalf of all nine states, argued that FERC's order pre-empts state authority to regulate retail sales and set rates. 
""This case isn't about rates,"" countered Louis Cohen, representing Enron Power Marketing Inc. before the court. ""What we're concerned about is getting onto the (grid) system."" 
Cohen said that under the current access rules a dominant utility in a state that has not moved to competition may still ""hog"" the lines and keep Enron and similar marketers from moving power across a region. 
The Justice Department, representing FERC before the court, argued that the commission only sought to strike a balance between the need to give competitors equal access to power lines and leaving retail market issues to the states. 
Edwin Kneedler, deputy solicitor general, told the court that FERC, in his view, could have gone further, as Enron has argued. But, he said, to do so it would first have had to order all utilities to separate retail sales and transmission, something it chose to leave to the states. 
The case, which is not expected to be decided until sometime next year, comes at a time of growing concern about electricity competition and power grid reliability in light of recent power problems in California. 
About half of the states have taken some steps toward retail electricity competition. 
Many power industry experts as well as the FERC commissioners have emphasized that a truly competitive electricity market will be difficult to achieve without smooth and efficient flow of electricity across large regions, if not nationally. And that, argue companies like Enron who want to compete with traditional utilities, will require more open access to transmission. 
In an attempt to smooth the flow of power, FERC has embarked on a campaign to establish four large, regional transmission organizations to manage the national power grid. A court decision rolling back some of FERC's authority over open access to transmission lines could affect that effort. 
Uncertainty over how far the federal government will be allowed to go in requiring transmission access also could affect state decisions on whether to embrace electricity competition, according to some industry experts.

Cauley Geller Bowman & Coates, LLP Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against Enron Corp. on Behalf of Investors

10/23/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Oct. 23 /PRNewswire/ -- The Law Firm of Cauley Geller Bowman & Coates, LLP announced today that a class action has been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division on behalf of purchasers of Enron Corp. (""Enron"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: ENE) common stock during the period between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). A copy of the complaint filed in this action is available from the Court, or can be viewed on the firm's website at http://www.classlawyer.com/pr/enron.pdf . 
The complaint charges that Enron and certain of its officers and directors violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were materially overstated as a result of the Company failing to timely write- down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally-held Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors.
If you bought Enron common stock between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive, and you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than December 21, 2001. If you are a member of this class, you can join this class action online at http://www.classlawyer.com/sign_up.html . Any member of the purported class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through Cauley Geller Bowman & Coates, LLP or other counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

The firm has offices in Florida, Arkansas and California, but represents investors throughout the nation.

Copyright (c) 2001 The Toronto Star
World Trade Organization chief Mike Moore says the 142-country body will go ahead with a key conference in Qatar from Nov. 9-13 that he hopes will give a major boost to the ailing global economy. 
The announcement at a news briefing yesterday in Doha, Qatar, ended weeks of uncertainty over the meeting's venue, which had been thrown into question by security fears, mounting international concern over terrorism and a surge of anti-Western feeling in Muslim countries since the start of U.S. attacks on Afghanistan.
""If something seismic or catastrophic happens, we will reconsider, but we are planning to come here in just over two weeks' time,"" Moore said. 
The focus of the conference will be efforts to launch a new round of negotiations among all member countries to remove many of the remaining barriers to free global trade. 
3M's profit sags 
Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. says third-quarter profit fell 21 per cent as a slumping global economy reduced sales and workforce cuts increased expenses. 
Profit fell to $394 million (U.S.), or 99 cents a share, from $499 million, or $1.25, in the year-ago quarter. Sales fell 7.1 per cent to $3.97 billion from $4.27 billion, the company added in a statement yesterday. 
3M, which makes products that range from Post-It Notes to circuit boards, has been eliminating 5,000 workers and cutting costs to cope with slowing sales. 
Copper plunges 
Copper fell in London yesterday, nearing the lowest price in almost 15 years, on expectations for slowing demand from users such as electronics makers and construction companies. 
Copper for delivery in three months fell as much as $8 (U.S.) to $1,366 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange, where prices are down 25 per cent this year. A move through the 1999 intraday low of $1,365 will mark the lowest price since February, 1987. 
Enron information sought 
Houston-based energy-trading giant Enron Corp. says the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has sought information on company transactions with limited partnerships that were managed by an Enron senior officer. 
In a statement yesterday, Enron said it will provide the federal regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week. 
The transactions to ""hedge certain merchant investments and other assets"" took place in 1999 and 2000, according to Enron's 2000 annual report, and resulted in a $16 million (U.S.) pre-tax gain to Enron in 1999 and a $36 million loss in 2000. 
Enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships. 
Upset investors sent shares of Enron down $5.40 more than 20 per cent to close at$20.65 in heavy trading in New York. 
Moulinex takeover okayed 
A court in the Paris suburb of Nanterre has approved a takeover offer by household-appliance maker Groupe SEB SA for troubled rival Moulinex SA. 
SEB is expected to retain nearly 3,500 jobs at Moulinex, about half of them in France, the court said yesterday. Moulinex has 8,800 employees worldwide, almost 5,600 of them in France. 
SEB was to disclose financial details of its offer at a news conference today. 
Small jets seen on rise 
Bombardier Inc. chief executive Robert Brown says use of the company's regional jets is actually increasing, even though air traffic is down in North America a crushing 30 per cent since the terrorist attacks in the United States. 
Brown said yesterday he has ""anecdotal evidence"" that airlines are flying the company's 50-seat jets more often and on more routes because the planes are more efficient than large planes to fly when traffic is light. 
The trend has not brought new sales, Brown said, but has helped firm up orders for the aircraft that typically take up to more than a year from the date of purchase to delivery. 
He was speaking at an opening ceremony for Bombardier's vast new aircraft-assembly plant in Mirabel, Que. 
Aliant shedding jobs 
Aliant Telecom Inc. plans to reduce its non-unionized workforce by 140 people, the Atlantic region's largest phone company said yesterday. 
A statement said that 70 of those people will receive retirement packages, but did not indicate when the other 70 employees in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland would lose their jobs or what severance they'd receive.

Swissair planes stand on the tarmac at Zurich's Kloten Airport yesterday as Switzerland's government announced a rescue package totalling 4.24 billion Swiss francs, or about $4 billion (Canadian).

SEC INQUIRY OF ENRON RATTLES STOCK

(Copyright 2001 by The Orlando Sentinel)
HOUSTON -- Shares of Enron Corp. plunged Monday after the energy trading giant said the Securities and Exchange Commission had sought information about the company's transactions with limited partnerships, which were managed by an Enron senior officer. 
In a statement, Enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week.
""We welcome this request,"" Enron chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth L. Lay said Monday. ""We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest."" 
Investors were upset by the news, however, sending shares of Enron down $5.40 to close at $20.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The transactions took place in 1999 and 2000, according to Houston- based Enron's 2000 annual report. They resulted in a $16 million pre- tax gain to Enron in 1999 and a $36 million loss in 2000. 
Enron officials would not provide details about the transactions or identify the limited partnerships, instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions. 
""Enron entered into transactions with [limited partnerships] to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets,"" according to the section. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the SEC first contacted Enron last week and described the request is an ""informal inquiry."" 
""This is not an investigation,"" he said. ""We see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us."" 
SEC spokesman John Heine said he could not comment on the filings. 
The electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the arrangements, the company's board was fully informed of and approved them, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC filings.

Enron Keeps Analysts Happy as Investors Flee: Call of the Day

Enron Keeps Analysts Happy as Investors Flee: Call of the Day

     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Over lunch in a conference
room at Boston's Four Seasons Hotel last Thursday, Enron Corp.
Chairman Kenneth Lay tried to convince analysts and investors that
the company has no more surprises.

     With the analysts, he apparently succeeded. Enron remains one
of Wall Street's most highly rated stocks, even after the largest
energy trader acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run
by its chief financial officer led to a writedown of $1.2 billion
in shareholder equity.

     Lay wasn't so successful with investors, who have abandoned
Enron shares, slashing their value 42 percent in a week.

     ``You've got a lot of people lining up to say the emperor has
no clothes,'' said Richard Gross of Lehman Brothers Inc., who
today repeated his ``strong buy'' rating on Enron. Analysts at
Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and other firms
have also kept their highest ratings on Enron.

     Gross still likes the look of Enron's finery. ``The core
franchise here is very valuable,'' he said, and the stock's
decline more than reflects the ``worst case'' for the company.

     In Boston and at similar meetings in Houston and New York,
Lay had to explain the unwinding of the partnerships. He and other
Enron executives assured investors the company has no more
surprises in store, according to Greg Phelps, who manages $1.1
billion at John Hancock Advisers Inc., and attended the Boston
session.

     The partnerships functioned somewhat like private equity
funds, according to analysts and investors, and included
investments that lost money. The Securities and Exchange
Commission has asked for more information about them, Enron said
yesterday.

                        One Hold, One Sell

     While two analysts have cut their Enron ratings after
learning about the partnerships, they only dented the company's
popularity on Wall Street.

     Michael Heim of A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis lowered
his rating to ``hold'' from ``buy'' on Friday. He said he has been
looking for discussion of the partnerships in Enron's SEC filings
and is only seeing ``vague references'' that don't leave him with
a ``good comfort level.''

     With Heim's rating change, Enron went from being the second
most highly rated stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to the
10th, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.

     Today, Zach Wagner at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis cut
Enron to ``reduce'' from ``accumulate.'' Ratings by Edward Jones,
which caters to individual investors rather than institutions,
aren't tracked by First Call.

     First Call translates analyst ratings into numbers, with
``strong buy'' a one, ``buy'' a two, and so on, then averages the
ratings to rank a company's Wall Street popularity. The most
highly rated stock is Tyco International Ltd., which has fallen 12
percent this year.

     Enron shares fell 86 cents to $19.79 today.

                        Remaining Skeptical

     However highly brokerage analysts rate the stock, ``I have to
remain skeptical,'' said Barry Borak, energy analyst at David L.
Babson & Co., which manages $60 billion in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

     ``There's been a huge loss of management credibility at
Enron,'' Borak said, because of the partnerships and the
unexpected departure in August of Jeffrey Skilling, who had held
the post of chief executive officer for six months and was heir
apparent to Lay. ``Nobody I've talked to thinks (Skilling's
departure) is for personal reasons,'' Borak said.

     Skilling helped transform Enron from a gas pipeline company
into the biggest energy trading company. Enron also owns power
plants in deregulated markets.

     Borak said Babson doesn't own Enron shares and won't be a
buyer ``until I can get better, more thorough information about
what else might pop up in the future.''

     Borak and other investors said Enron has a reputation for not
providing enough information about its businesses, and they said
this makes the positive view of the company on Wall Street more
difficult to understand.

     After Skilling resigned, Lay said the company would be more
open about its businesses. A bullet point in his talk in Boston
was ``increased transparency of financial and operating results,''
according to a handout provided at the Boston meeting.

                         Amazed, Dismayed

     Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale wrote in a
note to clients last week that she was ``amazed at the willingness
of Enron's management to break out earnings and expenses to the
degree that it disclosed in the third quarter.''

     Coale also wrote that she was ``dismayed by the apparent
`disguise' of the additional $1.2 billion equity hit that was not
disclosed in (Enron's) press release and was briefly mentioned in
the earnings conference call.'' Coale kept her rating on Enron at
``buy.''

     Phelps at John Hancock said that his ``cynical side''
believes that investment banking business has helped keep Wall
Street recommending Enron stock. ``They provide some good
underwriting business,'' he said.

     Credit Suisse First Boston managed a secondary sale of 12
million Enron shares in 1999, with Lehman Brothers acting
as co-manager. Credit Suisse has also managed bond sales for
Enron this year.



Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)
2001-10-23 16:38 (New York)

Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph.)

     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest
energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 million
loan, ensuring access to credit if the company is cut off from
money markets, say people familiar with the matter.

     Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company
said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its
finances. The company depends on a $3 billion commercial paper, or
short-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations.

     Moody's Investors Service last week placed all $13 billion of
the company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible
downgrade. Any drop in the rating may cut off Enron from the
commercial paper market, raising the costs of short-term debt.

     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to both
the capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.
He said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,
giving it enough cash to operate normally.

     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,
declined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, also
wouldn't comment.

     Shares of Enron, based in Houston, fell 86 cents to $19.79.
They have fallen 76 percent this year.

                         Complex Financing

     An investor sued Enron last week, saying dealings with two
partnerships run by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,
cost the company $35 million. The suit also calls Fastow's
leadership of the partnerships, set up to remove debt from Enron's
books, a conflict of interest.

     Enron bought back 62 million shares to unwind positions in
some partnerships run by Fastow, said Chief Executive Officer Ken
Lay on the conference call with investors today.

     The number of shares differs from a Wall Street Journal
report on Thursday that said Enron had bought back 55 million
shares. The buyback reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion,
the Journal said.

     The company set up the partnerships and other affiliated
companies to buy Enron assets such as power plants. The
partnerships allow Enron to take debt off its books, letting it
borrow to invest in its main business of commodities trading,
Enron said. Enron trades electricity, natural gas, oil, coal and
other commodities.

     ```They have complex off-balance sheet financing,'' said
Commerzbank analyst Andre Mead. ``It's difficult to ascertain the
full impact on shareholders.''

     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated
companies headed by Fastow. The company has at least $3 billion in
such ``off-the-books'' financing in affiliated companies, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors.

                      Depends on Asset Sales

     One partnership, Whitewing Management, owns 250,000 preferred
shares that Enron may have to convert to common stock. Whitewing
partners can demand their preferred shares be converted if Enron
common stock falls below a certain price or if Enron's credit
rating drops under investment grade.

     Whitewing and other Enron partnerships and trusts include
company executives as officers and directors, according to records
from the Texas secretary of state.

     ``Over the life of these trust structures, Enron has in fact
issued a sizable amount of equity,'' Enron Treasurer Ben Gilsan
said. Most of that was shares issued to Enron executives as part
of a deferred compensation plan, Gilsan said.

     The Whitewing partnership was financed with $1.4 billion in
bonds sold last year. The partnership used some of the proceeds to
buy Enron power plants and plans to retire the debt by selling
them, officials said on the conference call. Other company
partnerships operate with the same strategy.

     ``Some investors are worried the asset sales won't cover the
full amount (borrowed), and Enron will have to furnish support to
the detriment of shareholders,'' said Commerzbank analyst Meade.

                      Commercial Paper Rates

     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until
Oct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies
with the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not on
credit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for a
possible downgrade.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's rate the
company's debt at investment grade.

     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and
advice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the
company on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-
fired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, along
with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion
loan.



How Enron Blew It
Texas Monthly
November 2001

Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

by Mimi Swartz <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
 
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""

For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.

This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""

The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.

Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.

ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron. 

From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me."" 

He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""

PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?

But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.

HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""

Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started. 

LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985. 

It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.

Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""

The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""

Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.

THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 
You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.
""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.
""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""



Enron Fails to Smooth Things Over

Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) held a special conference call Tuesday to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock. 
But worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and the CEO publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off-balance sheet transaction. 
The transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex financing that Enron entered into with a partnership called LJM2, which was led by Enron's finance chief Andrew Fastow. Terminating this arrangement led to a $1.2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter. Monday, Enron stock plunged 20% after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission is probing ""related party transactions."" Executives declined to respond to questions about Fastow's role in the LJM2 partnership on the Tuesday call. 
Another key issue is the impact of the equity reduction. The company said on the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth quarter, due to the termination of the LJM2 financing. But CEO Ken Lay said the company wouldn't be increasing its earnings guidance of $1.80 a share for 2001 and $2.15 for 2002. 
When a share count drops, earnings per share should normally increase, assuming the earnings number stays constant. The 60 million shares are equivalent to about 6.5% of the company's diluted total in the third quarter. As a result, Enron should have raised its per-share profits forecast by about that much, assuming constant earnings. 
When asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing, CEO Lay replied that the company had previously increased its guidance for this year. He then affirmed the 2002 number. 
Now, to be fair, Enron may not be forecasting lower earnings. The planned reduction in shares may simply bring the total share count back close to a level in the fourth quarter and 2002 that analysts had originally expected. Notably, the share count in the third quarter jumped by 20 million, meaning a fourth-quarter reduction might not change matters that much. Alternatively, Enron may beat fourth-quarter estimates by 6.5%; perhaps the company has simply chosen not to increase guidance at this stage, given uncertainties in the economy. In any case, more clarity on this matter is clearly needed. 
Calls to Enron weren't immediately returned. The stock edged up 2% Tuesday after falling nearly 40% since last week amid worries about complex off-balance sheet deals. 
The call, arranged after Enron's Monday plunge, contained a lot of queries about two trusts, called Marlin II and Whitewing, against which Enron borrowed some $3.4 billion. Lay became testy after questioning by Richard Grubman of Boston-based hedge fund Highfields Capital Management. Grubman, who was called an ""a--hole"" by Enron's former CEO Jeff Skilling on an April conference call, was trying to find out the value of water assets held by Marlin II. The optimal way of paying back money borrowed through the trust is to sell the water assets. 
Grubman's line of questioning implied that the Marlin assets were worth only about $100 million, meaning Enron would have to find about $900 million to pay off the Marlin II-related debt. Grubman arrived at $100 million after factoring in what he saw as the effects of a third-quarter writedown to water assets, some of which are included in Marlin II. 
Lay disputed the $100 million number. At one point, he accused Grubman of driving Enron's stock down and monopolizing the Tuesday conference call. In the middle of Grubman's comments, Lay told the call operator to go to the next caller. 
Grubman didn't immediately return a call seeking comment. 
If Enron has to find $900 million, this can be done by issuing stock or raising cash on its balance sheet. If the latter route is taken, Enron says it's likely to use asset sales to generate the cash. Enron executives said liquidity would be sufficient and detailed at least $3.35 billion in available credit lines. 
But if Enron's debt-to-capital ratio exceeds 65%, the covenants on some of those lines are broken. After the $1.2 billion equity writedown and other charges taken in the third quarter, that ratio is probably about 50%-55% (Enron hasn't released a third-quarter balance sheet to arrive at an exact calculation). It would take $3 billion in further writedowns or charges to push Enron's debt-to-capital ratio up to 65%.

More Static For Enron

NEW YORK - Enron scrambled again to reassure investors this morning, after it disclosed yesterday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives. 

Enron (nyse: ENE ) last week reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments. The market took that in stride until media reports parsed the earnings announcement and disclosed that $35 million of those losses were connected with the two limited partnerships run by Fastow. Enron shares, which plunged 23% last week, nosedived another 21% yesterday. Enron bounced back slightly in morning trading. 
The turmoil makes it clearer than ever that the energy trader's problems weren't solved by the recent departure of Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling. 


AES Says Indian State Interfering In Ops, Complains To PM

10/23/2001

NEW DELHI (AP)--After Enron Corp. it is the turn of U.S.-based AES Corp. to seek the Indian prime minister's help to settle its grievances with a state government. 
In a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES Corp.'s President Dennis W. Bakke said his company's determination to continue in India was being tested by the government of eastern Orissa state.
The letter, a copy of which was made available to the Associated Press Tuesday, was dated Oct. 1 and appeared to have been faxed to the office of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. 
The Virginia-based energy company operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49% of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state. 
AES Corp. is the other major American power company besides Enron Corp. to have made big investments in India after the government allowed foreign investment in the power sector in the early 1990s. 
In his letter, Bakke drew Vajpayee's attention to the ""expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation ... and direct interference with day-to-day management"" by the state government and its agencies. The letter also complained about government-run agencies failing to pay 2.1 billion rupees ($1=INR47.985) in bills. 
""If the situation faced by AES is not remedied urgently, it will undermine the trust and confidence of foreign investors in India,"" Bakke wrote. ""While AES still remains committed to India as a country it would very much like to serve, our determination to continue is being tested."" 
The prime minister's office said it wasn't ready to comment on the report. Officials of the Orissa state government weren't available to respond to Bakke's charges in view of a Hindu festival. 
AES Corp. has already offered to withdraw from the distribution company - known as the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa. However, it has said that the company will continue with its interests in electricity generation. 
If AES Corp. decides to pull out completely, it will the third American company to do so. 
Cogentrix Inc. quit a power project in southern India before it was started, while Houston-based Enron is in the process of withdrawing from the Dabhol Power Project in western Maharashtra state, India's biggest ever foreign investment project. 
On Sept. 14, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay wrote a letter to Vajpayee threatening legal action to pursue claims of up to $5 billion relating to the Dabhol Power Co. dispute and questioned India's ability to honor its contracts. 
Lay had also warned that India may find it hard to attract foreign investors in the future because of the payment dispute with the Dabhol project, which stopped production and construction in May.

U.S.-based AES Corp. complains about harassment from Indian state government

NEW DELHI, India (AP) - The U.S.-based operator of two Indian power plants is seeking the help of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in its battle against alleged corporate intimidation leveled by local government authorities. 
AES Corp. President Dennis W. Bakke addressed the concerns in an Oct. 1 letter to Vajpayee, obtained Tuesday by the Associated Press.
In the letter, the Virginia-based energy company cited the ""expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation ... and direct interference with day-to-day management"" by the local government in the Indian state of Orissa. 
AES operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49 percent of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state. 
The complaint follows a similar appeal made to Vajpayee on Sept. 14 by Enron Corp., the only other major U.S. power company to make big investments in India after the government allowed foreign investment in the power sector in the early 1990s. 
In that case, Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay threatened legal action to pursue claims of up to dlrs 5 billion over a dispute with the Dabhol Power Co., and questioned India's ability to honor contracts. 
The prime minister's office said it was not ready to comment AES's complaint. Officials of the Orissa state government were not available to respond to Bakke's charges. 
""If the situation faced by AES is not remedied urgently, it will undermine the trust and confidence of foreign investors in India,"" Bakke wrote. ""While AES still remains committed to India as a country it would very much like to serve, our determination to continue is being tested."" 
AES Corp. has already offered to withdraw from the power distribution company - known as the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa. 
If AES Corp. decides to pull out completely, it will the third American company to do so.

"NETCO","The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

"Online Trading Simulation","We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

"EGM Organization Update & Announcement","
The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group.

In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. 

Crude and Products group
Mid-marketing
Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett.  

Origination
In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. 

Trading
Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas.  

Shipping
Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.

Weather
The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline.  

Coal
Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia.

Enron Japan
The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities.

LNG
LNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.

Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region.

Enron Freight Markets
EFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products.  

Global Risk Markets
David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months after startup.

Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with decommissioning insurance.

In April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power trading desk.

Financial Trading
Elsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron's developing agriculture business.  Billy Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.  

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignment and we look forward to the continued growth in all the EGM businesses.

"Bus Pass and Parking Information","
FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

Tom, I've attached a report that I downloaded from SAP, and that shows (in hours) how many hours of vacation you've taken, and how many hours you have remaining.  It's only thru the end of September, so the vacation that you took the other weekend is not included.

Just thought you might like to look at it.

"Bammel Lease Question","I was wondering if the Bammel lease to AEP contains any operating parameters to protect the integrity of the facility.  The question arises from the fact that Bammel  had about 24 BCF of remaining capacity when Enron turned the facility over to AEP.  We believe their plan is to max inject in June which would reduce the remaining capacity to around 12 BCF.  It could become a challenge to keep injections under the remaining 12 BCF level during the reaming 4-5 months of the injection cycle.  Enron always operated the facility with the understanding that a Gas In Place volume greater than 117.5 BCF could create a high enough pressure to jeopardize the safety of the wellhead casings and some of the abandoned wells.  We would not want the Texas RRC to question the safety of the Bammel facility.  From the other end of the perspective if the Gas In Place is taken below 65 BCF their is a high probability of watering out the outer wells and the facility itself.

Stocks Close Higher As Investors Cheer Earnings News
By Peter Edmonston

10/22/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
The Wall Street Journal Online 
Stocks rallied sharply Monday despite the widening anthrax scare, as a batch of better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 172.92, or 1.9%, to close at 9377.03 after gaining 40.89 points Friday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36.75, or 2.2%, to 1708.06 after climbing 18.59 points in the previous session. 
Other major stock indexes gained ground Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 16.42 to 1089.90, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 7.13 to 561.45, and the Russell 2000 Index gained 4.80 to 430.50. 
Bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened. 
The stock market's gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in Washington, D.C., was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation. Additionally, two other postal workers in Washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment. 
But stocks took the anthrax reports in stride, suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants, some analysts said Monday. ""The market is really shrugging off this news,"" said Mark Donahoe, a managing director at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. 
Upbeat earnings news from American Express, released Monday afternoon, seemed to give stocks an additional lift. 
Investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and U.S. military maneuvers in Afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results, said Steven Kroll Sr., managing director at Monness, Crepsi & Hardt. 
The uncertainty on the global front ""looks like it is going to be a long, drawn-out affair,"" Mr. Kroll said. ""I think stocks will revert back to being earnings-driven."" 
Although dismal by ordinary standards, last week's flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors, who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations. ""The markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings,"" said Mr. Donahoe of U.S. Bancorp. That resilience might be giving hope to investors this week, he added. 
Still, investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up, Mr. Kroll argued. 
Third-quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on Monday, with big companies such as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and U.S. Steel posting results that met or topped analysts' estimates. 
The Dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p.m. EDT when index component American Express reported earnings that, excluding certain items, beat Wall Street previously lowered estimates. 
The financial-services concern posted net income of $298 million, or 22 cents a share, down 60% from $737 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the September 11 attacks, American Express said it would have earned $595 million, or 45 cents a share, for the latest quarter. Analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Shares of American Express surged after the quarterly earnings release, closing up 3.4% at $30.32. 
Chip stocks helped lead the Nasdaq composite higher, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5.4%. The rally seemed to be a continuation of Friday's gains in the sector, sparked by positive earnings news from KLA-Tencor. 
U.S. Steel, the nation's No. 1 steelmaker, said it swung to a third-quarter loss from a profit a year earlier, hurt by oversupply and a weak economy. But excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another, U.S. Steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Shares of U.S. Steel rose 9.7% to $14.74. 
Investors also sent 3M shares nearly 5% higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by Wall Street estimates, despite a 21% decline in net income. And oil producers Conoco and USX-Marathon Group handily beat analysts' forecasts. 
But not all the earnings news was cheery. Local phone company SBC Communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates. Shares of SBC, a component of the Dow industrials, fell 5.1% to $41.40. 
Meanwhile, the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging, some analysts noted. On Monday, 3M guided Wall Stret's earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter, and a top executive at U.S. Steel told analysts that the company's fourth quarter would be ""difficult."" 
Companies ""are meeting third quarter expectations, but they are talking down the fourth quarter,"" said Mr. Kroll of Monness Crespi & Hardt. He said that some of the rise in Monday's markets might be a carryover from Friday's buying activity related to the expiration of U.S. stock option and index option contracts, an event known as ""double witching."" 
One of the hardest-hit stocks on Monday was Enron, an energy concern that said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer. Shares of Enron plunged 21% to $20.65. 
Overseas, stocks closed higher. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index gained 1.1%, while Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 2%. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.3%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended 0.3% lower. 
In economic news, the Conference Board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0.5% in September, matching the estimates of economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. The index -- a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy -- included some data gathered after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The decline, which was the index's largest one-month drop since January 1996, confirmed that the widespread weakness in the U.S. economy is deepening, the Conference Board said. Falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the September reading. 
In August, the leading-indicators index slipped 0.1%, less than the previous estimate of a 0.3% decline. Even so, the back-to-back declines paint a bleak economic picture, said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. 
The two-month decline in the index suggests that the already-weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year, Mr. Goldstein said. The overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown. 
In major U.S. market action: 
Stocks rose. On the Big Board, where 1.09 billion shares were traded, 1,813 stocks rose and 1,291 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.49 billion shares changed hands. 
Bonds were mixed. The 10-year Treasury note rose less than 1/16 point Monday, or 62.5 cents for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 4.618%. The 30-year bond fell 1/16 point to yield 5.364%. 
The dollar rose. The dollar bought 122.56 yen, compared with 121.20 yen late Friday. The euro traded at 89.18 U.S. cents, down from 89.84 cents late Friday.

Enron Faces Holder Suit From Fincl Chief Pacts

10/22/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A shareholder of Enron Corp. (ENE) filed a derivative suit in Texas court alleging that Enron's board breached their fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships. 
In a press release Monday, a law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest.
The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars. 
On Oct. 16, Enron announced that it will take a $35 million charge relating to the limited partnerships and revealed that the company had to repurchase 55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnerships, thereby reducing the company's shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. 
On Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested additional information regarding the limited partnerships. 
On Oct. 19, The Wall Street Journal reported that Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in Dec. 1999 principally to do business with Enron. 
Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments. 
Enron's New York Stock Exchange listed shares fell to a 52-week low on Monday following news that the SEC requested additional information. 
A spokeswoman from Enron said the company has not seen the lawsuit and it does not comment on pending litigation.

Shapiro Haber & Urmy Files Class Action on Behalf of Purchasers of Enron Corporation Stock (NYSE: ENE) in The Period From July 13, 2001 Through October 16, 2001

10/22/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)
BOSTON, Oct. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP has filed a class action suit alleging securities fraud in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division), 515 Rusk Ave., Houston, Texas 77002, against Enron Corporation (""Enron"") (NYSE: ENE) and certain of its officers and directors. 
The case was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period from July 13, 2001 through October 16, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period"").
The complaint alleges that the defendants violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""the Exchange Act""), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and that defendants' wrongful conduct artificially inflated the price of Enron common stock during the Class Period. The complaint charges that the defendants misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning the Company's financial transactions with two partnerships established by Enron's Chief Financial Officer, which resulted in substantial losses to Enron and a reduction in shareholders' equity of over $1 billion. The price of Enron's common stock plummeted over 20% in just three trading days following disclosure of the financial losses resulting from Enron's dealings with these partnerships. 
Plaintiff seeks to recover damages suffered by class members and is represented by the law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP, which has successfully prosecuted numerous securities class actions on behalf of defrauded investors. More information about the firm and its qualifications is available on the firm's website at www.shulaw.com.

Enron Board Approved Partnerships Run by Chief Financial Officer

10/22/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)
NEW YORK, Oct. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- An Enron (NYSE: ENE) shareholder has filed a derivative suit in Texas state court which charges that Enron's board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company by allowing its CFO, Andrew Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships. The Enron board lost the Company over $35 million by allowing Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a clear conflict of interest for the Enron CFO. 
In addition to other transactions, the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the Company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars for himself and the limited partnerships. On October 16, 2001 the Company announced that it would take a $35 million charge relating to the limited partnerships. It was also revealed that the Company had to repurchase 55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnerships, thereby reducing the Company's shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.
On October 22, 2001, the Company announced that the SEC recently requested additional information regarding these limited partnerships.

USA: UPDATE 3-SEC looks into Enron deals, stock slides 20 pct.
By David Howard Sinkman

10/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20 percent on Monday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transactions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August. 
A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating. The SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry.
Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. The company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years, and took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. 
Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months at the helm. 
Enron shares declined $5.49, or 21 percent, to $20.56 in Monday afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, shaving off almost $4.2 billion of its market capitalization. The stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8 percent on Monday, when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998. 
Shares declined 23 percent last week after the Journal ran its first story about the limited partnerships on Wednesday. 
Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC's inquiry into ""certain related party transactions"" involved the partnerships. 
""Related party transactions"" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in June. LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy-and communication-related investments. 
The Journal reported $35 million of its third-quarter loss of $638 million were connected with the limited partnerships 
Curt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should question Enron's use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets, ""most notably in telecommunications,"" have declined precipitously. 
""Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron's credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined,"" Launer said. 
Some analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke. 
""This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. 
""It's easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challenges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one."" 
Shares in the company are down 75 percent this year.

Enron shares plunge 20 percent after acknowledging SEC inquiry

10/22/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - Shares of Enron Corp. plunged more than 20 percent Monday after the energy trading giant said the Securities and Exchange Commission had sought information company's transactions with limited partnerships, which were managed by an Enron senior officer. 
In a statement, Enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week.
""We welcome this request,"" Enron chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth L. Lay said in a statement Monday. ""We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest."" 
Investors were upset by the news, however, sending shares of Enron down dlrs 5.30 to dlrs 20.75 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The transactions took place in 1999 and 2000, according to Houston-based Enron's 2000 annual report. They resulted in a dlrs 16 million pre-tax gain to Enron in 1999 and a dlrs 36 million loss in 2000. 
Enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships, instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions. 
""Enron entered into transactions with (limited partnerships) to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets,"" according to the section in the annual report. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the SEC first contacted Enron last week and described the request is an ""informal inquiry."" 
""This is not an investigation,"" he said. ""We see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us."" 
SEC spokesman John Heine said he could not comment on the filings. ""We can't confirm or deny that type of activity,"" Heine said. 
The electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements, the company's board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC filings.

STOCKWATCH Enron lower after SEC questions transactions; AG Edwards downgrades

10/22/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down sharply in late morning trade, after the Securities and Exchange Commission requested the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions, prompting AG Edwards to downgrade the stock to 'hold' from 'buy', dealers said. 
At 11.10 am, Enron was down 4.29 usd, or 16.47 pct, at 21.76. The DJIA was up 57.57 points at 9,261.68, and the S&P 500 composite index was up 5.57 points at 1,079.05.
In a statement this morning, Enron confirmed that the SEC had requested documents, and said it would ""cooperate fully"" with the commission. 
However, the company did not give any details of the transactions concerned or of the reasons behind the SEC's request. 
According to AG Edwards analyst Mike Heim, Enron ""significantly reduced"" its equity to unroll a partnership arrangement with a partially-owned subsidiary formerly run by Enron's chief financial officer. 
""This arrangement, which was not discussed in past SEC filings, has led to a growing distrust of the company by the financial community. 
""In our opinion, the market is most likely overreacting to the news being disseminated over the last few days. 
""However, we can give no assurances that all the problems at Enron have been fully disclosed,"" Heim said. 
In its statement this morning, Enron said although its internal and external auditors and attorneys have reviewed the related-party arrangements, adding that the Board was ""fully informed of and approved these arrangements"", which were disclosed in the company's SEC filings. 
""We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done,"" said chief executive Kenneth Lay.

Enron Shares Slide as SEC Seeks Information on Deals With CFO's Partnership

10/22/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -- Shares of Enron Corp. slumped Monday after the energy-trading concern said the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information about ""certain related party transactions,"" including those between Enron and a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer. 
Enron promised to cooperate fully with the SEC request and said in a prepared statement that it ""welcomes"" the request and looks forward to put ""any concern about these transactions to rest.""
In 4 p.m. EDT trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron (ENE) shares fell $5.40, or 21%, to $20.65. 
Last week The Wall Street Journal reported that a limited partnership organized by Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, made millions in profits in transactions with the firm. The story cited information reported in an internal partnership document. 
Enron also said last week it will repurchase up to 55 million shares that it had issued as part of transactions with LJM2 CO-Investment LP, the limited partnership created by Mr. Fastow. 
In addition, Enron took a $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter, mostly connected with write-downs of bad investments, producing a loss of $618 million, or 84 cents a share. Excluding charges, income was $393 million, or 43 cents a share, in the quarter. 
The charge covers a wide range of items including costs related to the limited partnerships that were, until recently, by Mr. Fastow. 
The company said the costs connected with the partnerships total $35 million and involve the early termination of ""certain structured finance arrangements."" 
The partnerships were set up two years ago, and while the company maintains that they are perfectly proper, some have suggested that it is a conflict of interest for Enron's chief financial officer to be involved in a partnership that was looking to purchase Enron assets, the Journal reported. 
The energy company said its auditors reviewed the arrangements and its board was fully informed and approved the deals, which were disclosed in SEC filings. 
""We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done,"" Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said on Monday. 
Separately, an Enron shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit in Texas court alleging Enron's board breached its fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships. 
A law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said in a prepared statement that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Mr. Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest. 
The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Mr. Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars.

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8)
2001-10-22 17:10 (New York)

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8)

     (Adds in sixth paragraph that analyst estimates dissolving
affiliated companies would cost $3 billion.)

     Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21
percent after the Houston-based company said the Securities and
Exchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships and
other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power
plants to lower the debt on its books. An investor sued Enron's
board Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35
million and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict of
interest.

     Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may be
forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the
owners in cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he
may be have to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies
if Enron's debt ratings fall too far.

     ``We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't go
below investment grade,'' said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John
Hancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.

      Enron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when it
repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled
by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journal
reported last week.

     Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors today.

     Enron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65. They touched $19.67 during
the day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.

                           Shares Plunge

     The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about
failed investments in trading of space on fiber-optic
communications networks and a water company, and the resignation
of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.

     While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons,
investors say his departure led them to question whether the
company was concealing problems, including possible liabilities
from affiliated companies.

     On Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a
$618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01
billion in failed investments.

      Moody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watch
for possible downgrade. The company's debt is rated at investment
grade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.

     The company received a faxed request for information from the
SEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmer
said, and will respond ``as soon as possible.''

     ``We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to
the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to
rest,'' Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.

                          Dilution Fears

     Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing
vehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texas
secretary of state. Fastow and other Enron executives are named as
the controlling partners or the board members in the companies.

     Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removing
the debt for those projects from Enron's books. That allows Enron
to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting
what it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debt
analyst Todd Shipman said.

      Enron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and other
commodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gas
pipelines.

     Dismantling the affiliates would be costly. Whitewing
Management, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power
plants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000
preferred shares of Enron.

     Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common
stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit
rating drops below investment grade, according to company filings.
That would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment.

     ``The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are
out there?'' Shipman said. ``Investors are worried they might have
to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they
originally thought.''

                        Worrisome Financing

     Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's
``related party arrangements,'' the board approved them, and they
were disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.

     That hasn't eased concerns. The reduction of shareholder
equity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to
worry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, the
Salomon analyst. Enron also may take another $2.4 billion in
losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and
projects in South America, he wrote.

     Enron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per
$1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 on
Friday, traders said. Yield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from
6.33 percent.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade.

     Fastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him,
Palmer said. Fastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman Karen
Denne said. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the
agency's request to Enron.

     ``We believe everything that needed to be considered and done
in connection with these transactions was considered and done,''
Lay said in the statement.

-------------------------
Entering the new millennium, energy companies are being forced to do business in new ways.

Subject: Firm Transport Contracts and available storage space



Tom and Hunter, 

I am an Associate working in Don Miller's ENA estate management group.  British Petroleum has inquired about Enron's existing Firm NG Transport Contracts and available storage contracts.  They specifically listed these types of assets as ones that BP would be interested in looking at buying from Enron.  Can the two of you get back to either Stuart or myself with respect to what is available and some indication of pricing for these assets.  Thanks.

Regards, 

Stephen Plauche, Associate

"Solicitation Calls","Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, ""I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?""

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

Subject:	Update on New Building

I attended a meeting yesterday and was updated on the following:

1. All Ozarka water needs to be cancelled by 11/9/01. There will be filtered water provided in the kitchens.  Ozarka coolers will not be allowed on the floor. 

2. There will be drinks provided in the refrigerators in the big kitchen.

3. We are limited to food vendors because of security reasons and will be limited to what we order for lunches.  It will only be for a limited time.  As of right now only Takeout Taxi and Sodexho Marriott are allowed in the new building, but they are working on agreements with others.

4.  Cafeteria should open by 1/15 in the new building, but it will be Sodexho Marriott, there will be not outside vendors.

5.  We can not use Jayz Beverage as of right now in the new building, only Sodexho Marriot  ( I will pass out a list of what they carry) - let me know if their prices ar not comparable to Jayz.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

-Ina

Enron Shares Fall on Concern Over CFO's Partnerships (Update4)

     (Updates with Chief Financial Officer Fastow didn't
immediately return a call for comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares have
fallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggest
energy trader's dealings with partnerships run by its chief
financial officer contributed to investment losses.

     Enron's stock dropped 10 percent today. Enron's board cost
the company at least $35 million by allowing Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to manage LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,
partnerships that bought Enron assets, a shareholder alleged
Wednesday in a lawsuit.

     The lawsuit came the day after Enron reported $1.01 billion
in third-quarter losses from failed investments. The Wall Street
Journal reported $35 million of the losses were connected with the
two limited partnerships. Enron also reduced shareholders' equity
by $1.2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the
partnerships, the paper reported yesterday.

     ``It looks sleazy,'' said Roger Hamilton, a manager at John
Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares. ``If you are
someone who invests in a company's management, it's almost time to
punt with Enron.''

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't return calls or written
requests seeking comment. Fastow didn't immediately return a
telephone call for comment.

     Fastow and a handful of associates made more than $7 million
last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital
increases on an investment of about $3 million in one of the
partnerships, the Journal reported today.

                        Buying Enron Assets

     Fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and
partnerships that appear to have ties to Houston-based Enron,
based on filings with the Texas secretary of state.

     The foreign business corporations and limited liability
companies have directors, officers or managers whose address is
listed as 1400 Smith Street in Houston, Enron's corporate address,
according to Texas records.

     Fastow is listed as a director, officer or managing member in
each one. At least one of the companies bought and sold Enron
assets, including foreign power plants.

     Whitewing Management, which lists Fastow as its managing
member, received $807 million from the sale of Enron debt last
year.

    Under the terms of the debt sale, Whitewing is allowed to use
the proceeds to buy power plants from Enron or make other
``permitted investments.'' Whitewing has bought 14 Enron plants or
companies since 1999 and sold four.

     Enron's Denne has not responded to written requests about
Fastow's role at Whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the
value of Enron assets to benefit outside investors or company
executives at Enron's expense.

     Shares of Enron fell $2.95 to $26.05. They have fallen
69 percent this year.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron stock sustains further heavy losses.

10/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(New first paragraph, adds additional analyst comment) 
By Andrew Kelly
HOUSTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. stock sustained further heavy losses on Friday as investor confidence in the former Wall Street favorite was rocked by reports about the company's relationship with a limited partnership that was run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer. 
The energy giant's stock closed down $2.95 or 10.2 percent at $26.05 per share, making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in over four years. 
Analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the Wall Street Journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron. 
""I don't think this thing passes the smell test,"" said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""I think the CFO should be out of there right now. In the interest of the stockholders, that CFO should be gone,"" he said. 
Enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements, but Fastow severed his ties with the LJM2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities. 
POOR JUDGMENT? 
Analysts said that at the very least, the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at Enron, which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high-profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer Jeff Skilling in August. 
""For a company that had a lot of question marks around it already, these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors,"" said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade. ""It points to poor decision-making on behalf of the board and top management at Enron,"" he said. 
Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, was one of Wall Street's high flyers last year, when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent. 
The stock's ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company's plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy trading platform. 
This year Enron's shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the Internet soured, Skilling resigned after only six months as CEO, and the company's Dabhol power plant project in India became mired in a payments dispute. 
Moody's Investors Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after Enron took $1.01 billion in write-downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non-core businesses, including broadband and water services. 
Some of Enron's financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings. 
Analysts said Enron's credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the LJM2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead. 
""What don't we know that went on at that company? Where's the credibility?"" asked one frustrated analyst. ""We don't know if it's limited to this,"" he said.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Broadband Unit Takes A Beating
By Michael Rieke

10/19/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Early last year, Enron Corp.'s (ENE) hype and skyrocketing share price enticed a number of other energy companies into the telecommunications business.
Now investors are wondering whether Enron is leading the charge out of telecom. 
The company announced Oct. 16 that its broadband unit lost $80 million before interest and taxes in the third quarter on revenue of $4 million. In the third quarter of last year, the unit lost $20 million on revenue of $162 million. 
Enron also recorded a $180 million non-recurring charge for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter of this year. That amount included severance costs for cutting 400-500 jobs, loss on sale of inventory and the reduced value of Enron's content services. 
At an analysts meeting Oct. 16, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay said the broadband business is ""not that robust"" right now. Industry revenue is low and there's substantial overcapacity in the bandwidth market, ""more than even we anticipated,"" Lay said. 
The company still has a problem finding creditworthy counterparties for bandwidth trading. Consolidation in the telecom sector has also eliminated potential trading partners. 
""A year ago it looked like an excellent business to get into,"" he said. ""Others thought so, too."" 
Looking back, Enron could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital, Lay said. It spent ""too much too soon."" 
An Ominous Comparison 

He compared Enron's move into telecom with its move into the water business with its Azurix unit. That comparison probably won't be good news to those who still have broadband jobs at Enron. 
Azurix caused Enron to take a bigger writedown - $287 million - than broadband in the third quarter. The water business has been a bigger and longer-lasting headache than broadband. 
Maybe Enron's surviving broadband employees will feel better knowing that Lay told analysts the company is exploring alternatives to preserve its play in telecom at a reasonable price so it will be ready when the business recovers. 
It's trying to reduce general and administrative costs in broadband to $40 million a quarter and is on track to reach that goal next year, he said. It could cut those costs even more in order to sustain the business. 
Meanwhile, the company is trying to determine which parts of the telecom business it wants to be in, he said. 
Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley told analysts the company needs to determine how much network and hardware it needs. 
At one time, they had thought that they wanted to use physical network assets as a springboard, Whalley said. Now they ""wouldn't want to forever be in the network business."" 
Both executives mentioned the possibility of joint ventures in telecom. Lay said other companies are asking Enron to do them. Whalley said the company has talked about exchanging fiber and other assets. 
The one part of the telecom business Enron still seems committed to is broadband intermediation. ""Intermediation"" is a term the company uses in most of its commodity businesses, said an Enron spokeswoman. It's a combination of trading and deal origination - wholesale and enterprise customers. 
More Bad News Expected 

Rebecca Followill, a research analyst for Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc., she had expected a larger writedown in broadband for the third quarter. 
""If you look at how much the stocks of their peers in broadband have fallen, you've got to figure that their assets' values have fallen similarly,"" Followill told Bandwidth Beat. ""I was expecting more like an 80% writedown in broadband."" 
Another analyst, who didn't want to be identified, said he also expects more broadband writedowns from Enron. ""To the extent that they can take more writedowns, I think it would make eminently good sense to do it."" 
He predicted ""a $200 million haircut"" in the first quarter of next year because of a goodwill valuation issue. 
And that might not be the end of it. Enron had a net of $948 million of broadband property, plant and equipment at the end of last year, he said. They had another $600 million of risk management asset receivables, inventories and working capital items. 
Followill doesn't see much future in broadband for Enron. 
""I think the business will shrink to the point where it won't be shown as a key sector in their reporting,"" she said. 
Enron might keep a small broadband group in case the market rebounds, she said. Her investor clients don't expect broadband to contribute to Enron's earnings within the next three years. 
She thinks Enron is looking for an exit strategy. 
The other analyst said Enron is trying to preserve some value in broadband. ""It doesn't look like there's any right now, to be honest,"" he said. ""They'll carry the trading operation to some degree.""

Dynegy Chief: Bandwidth Growth Won't Wait For Trading
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/19/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson understands why some think he is mistaken in believing the bandwidth sector has reached its bottom and is recovering. 
But those critics don't understand his bandwidth business, Watson told Dow Jones Newswires in an exclusive interview. They don't understand how the business world has changed since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he said.
In announcing third-quarter results for Dynegy Monday, Watson said the bottom in bandwidth demand was reached on Sept. 11 and that the market would begin recovery in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Businesses are reassessing where to store data and how to distribute operations to avoid losing everything in a sudden catastrophic event, be it of natural or human origin. That's what's driving the recovery, he said. 
Also, businesses will avoid travel, he said, relying instead on video conferencing. 
Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman Kenneth Lay said Tuesday that he hasn't seen any signs of recovery in telecom. The bandwidth market is suffering, in part, because there are few creditworthy companies to trade with, he said. 
""They're trying to find trading partners for broadband,"" Watson said. ""That's going to be tough to do."" Dynegy isn't concentrating on bandwidth trading because there isn't ""a realistic model"" for it yet, he said. ""I said two years ago it was at least two years away. I still think it's probably at least two years away, before we actually call it a trading commodity."" 
The metro-area infrastructure that Dynegy and other companies are building will create connections between networks, which are needed in order to trade bandwidth as a commodity, Watson said. 
It's unfortunate that Enron's model for bandwidth as a traded commodity is the dominant image for the entire market, Watson said. Dynegy's model includes telecom contracts, negotiated directly with customers for long-term supply of bandwidth. 
Dynegy's bandwidth trading desk is staffed by four people. For the past several months, they have been buying bandwidth for Dynegy's customers. The goal has been to build a customer base. ""We're looking at being an intermediary, and really looking at the same customers that we feed energy today."" 
Since Dynegy lit its 16,000 route-mile network two weeks ago, the trading desk has been trying to fill the company's network instead of buying bandwidth from others. ""I'm trying to find enterprises that have communication requirements,"" Watson said. 
He pointed to ChevronTexaco Corp. (CHX) as a target for those services. ""They have offices that never talked to each before,"" he said. ""Now they've got to talk to each other. I would say that the credit quality of Chevron and Texaco is pretty reasonable."" 
ChevronTexaco owns about 26% of Dynegy, said a Dynegy spokesman. Dynegy and ChevronTexaco already have a large energy trading relationship which includes natural gas and gas liquids. 
The average burn rate of Dynegy Global Communications, the corporation's telecommunications unit, is $20 million to $25 million a quarter, Watson said. In the third quarter, it lost $15 million, down from $20 million in the second quarter. 
Dynegy predicts that Global Communications will break even or record a small loss before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter. 
""If we can get to (income of) $10 million per month - that's what we need really,"" he said. ""If we can get there by the end of next year, I'll be very happy. I think by '03, this market will have righted itself."" 
Watson believes telecommunications has the potential to transform Dynegy. 
""Dynegy is an energy company,"" he said. ""Our energy merchant company is doing very well and business is growing like a weed...(Telecommunications) is not our core business by any stretch right now. But I'd love to be able to tell you it's going to be. I'd love to be able to tell you it is someday.""

UK: Jobs in base metals down but definitely not out.
By Amanda Cooper

10/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Dismal industrial demand and the fickleness of hedge funds seduced by more volatile markets have slashed London Metal Exchange members' profits over the past year and set off a gathering wave of job cuts. 
The decline and fall of base metal prices in the past year and a half has prompted a series of high-profile companies to withdraw from the market, casting a pall over next week's yearly LME Week industry gathering in London.
Jobs have gone from front office to back in trading houses and banks, raising questions about the prospects for those now seeking work. 
""Good people can always be placed. As long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire,"" Sarah Gilley of London-based recruitment group Exchange Consulting said. 
""Where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets, people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies."" 
Last week, ScotiaMocatta, a subsidiary of the Bank of Nova Scotia and a key ring dealing member, unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the LME floor, prompting around 25 job losses among traders, phone jockeys and clerks. 
Then blue-blooded banker N.M. Rothschild & Sons closed its London and New York base metals units. It left its core precious metals business intact, but 20 base metals staff were laid off in the process. 
In the same week, the LME's largest floor trader, Enron Metals, said it planned to cut 10 to 20 percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut 250 to 500 jobs in the Enron Group . 
SECURITY 
With three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time, competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security. 
""What we're finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record, which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so they're keen to stay put,"" Gilley said. 
""So whereas someone who might be a big money-spinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years, they are now staying for three to five years. 
""They probably feel that they're reasonably safe where they are, they're well recognised and not going to stick their necks out,"" she said. 
BONUS FEARS 
October has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by LME week functions and conferences 
Also, traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance-linked bonuses, which are usually announced at the end of the year. 
""Those who are in work at the moment are sticking. Often at this time of year, people are hanging on for their bonuses. But I don't think any of them are anticipating good bonuses. They're probably just happy to have a job,"" Sian Griffiths of Exchange Consulting said. 
LME volumes traded have been fallen over the past 18 months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hi-tech and telecomms stocks. 
Metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients, and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market. 
Companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal. 
""A lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now re-aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it, "" Gilley said. 
""The other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing,"" she added. 
As for morale in the industry, individuals' confidence in their future is seemingly undimmed. 
""Just because I've lost my job doesn't mean I'm going to sell my Porsche,"" one trader said.

New Power Hldg Sees Meeting 3Q Loss Estimate

10/19/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

PURCHASE, N.Y. -(Dow Jones)- New Power Holding Inc. (NPW) expects to meet its prior third quarter loss estimates; and said it has revised an agreement with Enron Corp. (ENE), lowering the collateral New Power must post under a master netting agreement. 
In a press release Friday, New Power said the amendment to the Enron pact and cost-cutting efforts will allow the company to continue to conduct business until it secures ongoing asset-backed financing.
The company reiterated its earlier expectations of a third quarter loss of $65 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. 
Analysts put the company's third quarter loss at $1.16 a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Third quarter revenue will be ""slightly lower"" than the $60 million to $65 million forecast in August, New Power said. 

In the year-ago third quarter New Power lost $1.23 a share on revenue of $18.19 million. 
The amendment to the master netting agreement with Enron North America Corp., Enron Energy Services Inc. and Enron Power Marketing Inc. affects the master cross-product netting, setoff, and security agreement, and expands through Jan. 4 the types of collateral that New Power is permitted to post to the Enron units. 
Under the amended pact, the first $70 million of posted collateral must be in the form of cash, while amounts in excess of $70 million may consist of not more than $40 million of eligible receivables and inventory of New Power, valued at discounts specified in the amendment, and subject to a $25 million limit for October 2001. 
Shares of New Power traded recently on the New York Stock Exchange at $1.67, up 1 cent, or 0.6%, on early composite volume of 7,900 shares. Average daily volume is 223,800 shares.

Laura,

The allocated costs are determined by other groups but so far we haven't gotten much planning information for 2002.  We did get information for Outside Legal but that was just what had been allocated in 2001 as of August.  I did include an estimate for this by considering what was planned for in 2001 and what actuals were.  No information has been provided for the other allocated costs.  In some cases such as System Development, the amount planned for in 2001 was quite large so I went ahead and included that  same plan number for 2002 until we can get better information.

I don't have any detail to give you as of now but I'll pass along anything I receive.

USA: Enron seen facing long road to restore confidence.

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. moved in the right direction by releasing more detailed financial data and tackling problems at peripheral businesses, but the energy giant still has a way to go to make Wall Street happy, analysts said Wednesday. 
Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on Tuesday. The company took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments, measures Enron executives said credit rating agencies were comfortable with.
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone said on Wednesday he was ""not thrilled"" by the announcement during a conference call to discuss third-quarter earnings. And for good reason. 
Moody's Investors Service subsequently issued a statement saying it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. 
""There appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved,"" Barone said. 
The writedowns on poorly performing assets and a more detailed breakdown of the company's operations went some way to appeasing Wall Street after a tumultuous year in which Enron's stock lost about two-thirds of its value, but analysts said they were not about to let Enron off the hook just yet. 
Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters said he remained concerned about Enron's quality of earnings and cash flow. 
Winters said he believed Enron would have liked to take even bigger charges and writedowns, but was unable to do so without putting its credit ratings at risk, which could adversely affect some of the company's financing arrangements. 
""Problem assets and overvalued assets on the balance sheet remain, particularly overseas,"" he said. 
One such asset is Enron's 65 percent stake, valued at $1 billion, in the Dabhol power plant project in India, which has been stalled because of a long-running payments dispute with its only customer, a local utility company. 
Enron's stock closed down $1.64, or 4.85 percent, at $32.20 on Wednesday. 
For the year to date the stock is down about 61 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index , which has fallen some 24 percent over the same period. 
Enron was a Wall Street favorite last year when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the company's broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen sharply this year as sentiment toward broadband soured, new chief executive Jeff Skilling resigned after just six months in the job and wrangling continued over the Dabhol power plant project.

USA: UPDATE 1-RTO seen key to boosting New England power supply.
By Scott DiSavino

10/17/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Energy companies said the future development of new power plants and transmission lines in the U.S. Northeast hinges, in part, on setting up a Northeast Regional Transmission Organization (RTO). 
RTOs are predominantly for-profit groups established to bring all of a region's high-voltage transmission lines under central control while ensuring equal access to the lines to all power suppliers seeking to market their goods across the grid.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which oversees the interstate wholesale power market, believes RTOs will benefit consumers by enhancing competition among power providers, in turn improving service and driving down rates. 
""If FERC can drive the Northeast RTO to closure in a reasonable period of time, it will accelerate the development of new transmission and generation,"" Enron Corp.'s managing director of global government affairs, Rick Shapiro, told Reuters. 
Houston-based Enron is the nation's top energy marketer. 
""How and when the RTO gets implemented will radically impact the market. It's crucial to the development of the market in New England,"" Mirant Corp. spokesman Ray Long told Reuters. 
Energy provider Mirant, of Atlanta, has 1,400 megawatts (MW) of generation in New England. The company is currently adding another 700 MW to its Canal station in Massachusetts. 
""Once we get the permits for Canal, we will reassess whether to proceed with the project. A big part of that assessment will depend on the RTO process,"" Long said. 
THE NORTHEAST RTO 
FERC wants to see four super-regional RTOs created in the U.S. - in the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. 
Several regions have taken long strides toward developing RTOs, including a not-for-profit model proposed in the Midwest and rival for-profit plans vying for FERC approval in the West. 
FERC Chairman Patrick Wood, seeking to spur the development of RTOs, favors giving utilities until Dec. 15 to join one or forfeit their right to sell electricity in the wholesale market, though the commission has not voted on this plan. 
The Northeast RTO will include New England, New York, the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) region and possibly parts of eastern Canada. 
FERC said it wants the Northeast RTO to be built on the PJM market platform and to include the best practices of the New England and New York markets. 
PJM Interconnection, which operates the power grid in parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and Washington, D.C., is the nation's only fully functioning RTO. 
""The process FERC set in place to establish one RTO in PJM, New York and New England is going to get us where we need to be in terms of having a vibrant wholesale market,"" Long said. 
Long said Mirant determined a single Northeast RTO would save more than $440 million annually by eliminating the ""artificial borders that now exist between New York, New England and PJM."" 
An administrative law judge, acting as a mediator for FERC, considered three proposals for creating the Northeast RTO. 
The three plans were proposed by interested parties, including Mirant and Enron, and the region's grid operators - the New York Independent System Operator (ISO) in New York, ISO New England in New England and PJM. 
Last month, the judge asked the FERC to decide who will govern the Northeast RTO and what the timetable is to put the plan in place. The judge favored a plan put forward by the New York ISO and ISO New England. 
""If FERC implements the RTO plan proposed by PJM in 2003, consumers could save $1.5 billion ... $440 million a year ... over the New York/New England plan, which would not be implemented until 2006,"" Long said. 
Under the PJM plan, PJM would overlay its current market model across the entire region, while adopting some of the best practices of the other markets. 
""Although nothing is perfect, PJM is widely accepted as the best market in the region. New York and New England, which are younger markets, are still works in progress with some bugs to work out,"" Enron's Shapiro said.

Enron Seeks Replacement For AGA's Gas Storage Report

10/17/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE), the nation's largest natural gas trading company, isn't ready to let the regular report on U.S. natural gas storage inventory die, a company executive said Tuesday. 
Because the American Gas Association has said it will discontinue its weekly gas storage report at the end of the year, Enron would like to see another organization take over the report, said John Lavorato, president and chief executive of the company's Americas Wholesale Services unit.
Speaking at a meeting with analysts, Lavorato said the storage report is important for the gas industry to keep track of industry fundamentals. 
Without a regular report on storage gas inventory, the gas industry can expect less frequent but greater price changes than seen in the past, he said. 
The Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration publishes monthly data on gas storage, but the information isn't as timely as data the AGA reports each Wednesday. 
The EIA issued its latest gas storage report Oct. 9. It showed the amount of gas in storage at the end of July. The data comes from reports filed by operators of gas storage facilities. 
It also showed estimates of the amount of gas in storage at the end of August and September. Those estimates are generated by a computer model. 
Wednesday's weekly storage report from the AGA will show estimated inventory as of Oct. 12. The AGA estimate is based on reports from gas storage facilities. That data is then run through an AGA computer model to generate the report. 
Lavorato said he would like to see the EIA, the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America or consultants like PIRA Energy Group, an international energy consulting firm, take over reports on storage inventory. 
INGAA is an industry trade group representing gas pipeline companies in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. They manage many of the gas storage facilities. 
Lavorato would like to see a new report based on data that could be audited, he said. 
He said he thinks the AGA has found itself ""in the middle of something it didn't want to be in."" Originally intended for use within the gas industry, the weekly AGA report has become high-profile, and is even watched by equity markets, he said. 
Some industry participants have criticized the AGA report, wondering whether it can be manipulated by companies that supply data to the AGA. Many of those companies also trade physical gas and gas futures. 
When the AGA has revised storage figures from previous reports, gas prices have sometimes reacted wildly.

Bush to Nominate Kelliher to Open FERC Seat, White House Says
2001-10-17 16:09 (New York)

Bush to Nominate Kelliher to Open FERC Seat, White House Says

     Washington, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- President George W. Bush
will nominate Joseph Kelliher, a policy adviser to U.S. Energy
Secretary Spencer Abraham, to fill the open seat on the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, the White House said.
    
If the Senate approves Kelliher, a former Republican counsel
for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the commission will
have its full five members for the first time since Pat Wood,
Bush's first FERC appointee, became chairman Sept. 1.
     
``I hope they speed him through the process,'' said
Commissioner Nora Brownell, a Republican who was appointed by Bush
earlier this year. ``He is a thoughtful person who knows how to
work through issues.''
    
Kelliher's nomination comes as the commission has pledged to
closely monitor and investigate abuses in the electricity and
natural gas markets and promote competition. In the next month or
so, it is due to choose which groups will run the electric power
grid around the country, an important step in deregulating the
nation's power markets.
     
A former power industry lobbyist, Kelliher would fill the
opening left by the departure of Curt Hebert, a Republican
appointed by President Bill Clinton and named chairman by Bush.
Hebert left the commission Aug. 31 to join Entergy Corp. after the
White House made it clear Bush planned to make Wood the chairman.
With Kelliher, FERC will have three Republicans and two Democrats.
     
``Kelliher will be a valuable final addition to the team now
working actively to finish the transition to truly competitive and
dynamic power markets,'' said the Electric Power Supply
Association, which represents competitive power sellers such as
Enron Corp.
     
The commission is responsible for ensuring fair wholesale
electricity and natural gas prices.



Energy Regulators May Loosen Price Caps on Western Power Sales
2001-10-17 14:59 (New York)

Energy Regulators May Loosen Price Caps on Western Power Sales

     Washington, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Federal regulators are
considering changes to wholesale price caps on electricity in
California and 10 Western states, which power producers hope will
allow them to charge more when supplies in the region are tight.
     
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission plans a public
conference Oct. 29 to discuss altering the pricing formula. The
commission established caps in April and June, after skyrocketing
electricity costs led to insolvency for California's largest
utilities, units of PG&E Corp. and Edison International.

     ``We have heard and understand that people do think the
solution was very California-centric, and it was,'' FERC Chairman
Pat Wood said, indicating changes in the formula are likely. ``But
California's needs were very urgent at the time.''

     While commissioners declined to say what they would be
willing to change about the pricing formula, they want to fine-
tune the caps before the winter, which is the peak period of
demand and may yet cause another jump in prices, Wood said.
Changes could be made next month.

     The current pricing formula is based on the most-expensive
power generated in California. Enron Corp., Sierra Pacific
Resources and other sellers of power to California want the
formula to consider costs from all generators in the region.

     Enron blamed the formula for a July 2 blackout in Nevada,
when sellers withheld supply because local prices were too low
based on the highest cost of supply then being offered in
California.

                         Lower Power Costs

     Though the cost of wholesale power in California has dropped
since the commission ordered the first emergency cap on April 25,
Wood said the Western states may face another shortage of power
and high prices this winter.

     The Pacific Northwest depends on hydropower for much of its
energy needs, and rainfall has been below normal this year. Part
of the shortfall in power last year and early this year was the
result of a drought that reduced power available from dams.

     ``I remain concerned about that part of the country,'' Wood
said. ``It has not been raining a whole lot out there.''

     The average price for a megawatt-hour at the California-
Oregon border in September was $24.91, down from $313.70 in April.
A megawatt-hour is enough electricity to power about 750 average
California homes for an hour.

     On the agenda for this month's conference is a proposal to
link the formula to the price of natural gas, a fuel used in many
generating plants.

     ``I'm not predisposed for or against specific changes,'' said
FERC Commissioner Nora Brownell. The Oct. 29 conference will help
the commission determine aspects of the price control that the
parties involved agree are working and those that are not, she
said.

                             Surcharge

     In a related matter, the commission also may halt the 10
percent surcharge it permits generators to charge in California to
cover the costs of collecting bad debt. The insolvent California
utilities now have plans to pay off their debts.

     For power sellers in the West, the current price caps often
require utilities to sell their excess power at a loss, Enron,
Sierra Pacific and other marketers said in statements to the
commission. They said the price they sometimes pay for power is
higher than the cost of supply from the most-expensive producer in
California.

     ``The determination of the proxy price should not be limited
to California generators,'' Enron said in a government filing. It
should be ``determined by the least-efficient generator in the
entire West.''

     Power marketers also should be allowed to recover
``justifiable costs above the proxy prices,'' Enron wrote.

     California officials had demanded the price controls after
PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison's Southern California
Edison racked up more than $14 billion in power-buying losses.

     The caps were extended to other Western states -- Oregon,
Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado,
Montana, Idaho and Utah -- in June because some said generators in
the West could simply get around the cap by selling outside
California when prices were higher elsewhere. The caps don't
expire until Sept. 30, 2002, though they can be changed.

     California said before the price cap was extended to other
states that it sometimes had to outbid buyers in neighboring
states at prices above the caps to buy enough electricity to avoid
blackouts.

     On July 2, Sierra Pacific cut supplies to 10,000 customers
for 45 minutes when temperatures soared and three power plants
were idled. It couldn't buy 50 megawatts of power in the spot
market, partly because of suppliers' concerns with the federal
cap, company spokesman Paul Heagan said at the time.


Enron Faces Questions Over Limited Partnerships, WSJ Reports
2001-10-17 10:11 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is facing
questions over agreements with two limited partnerships run by its
chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, the Wall Street Journal
reported.

     Fastow set up LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP with
the approval of Enron's board. The partnerships have engaged in
billions of dollars of complex hedging transactions with Enron
involving company assets and Enron stock, the paper said. It isn't
clear from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings what
Enron received in return.

     Enron said about $35 million of its $1.01 billion charge
reported yesterday was connected with the partnerships and
involves the ``early termination ... of certain structured finance
arrangements,'' the paper said. Chief Executive Officer Kenneth
Lay said in an earlier interview that related transactions
involving top managers aren't unusual, the paper said.

     According to the arrangement, the general partner, made up of
Fastow and at least one other Enron employee, received a
management fee of as much as 2 percent annually of the total
amount invested, the paper said, citing the LJM2 offering
document. Fastow declined to comment, the paper said.

Some Merrill Executives Had Stakes in Enron Partnership --- Investments Raise Conflict-of-Interest Questions

Nearly 100 Merrill Lynch & Co. executives invested more than $16 million of their own money in a controversial partnership the securities firm was selling for Enron Corp., even as other senior Merrill officials decided to turn down the offer, people close to Merrill said. 
Among the top Merrill officials who put their own money into the Enron partnership were current Vice Chairman Thomas Davis; Daniel Bayly, Merrill's investment-banking chief; and Schuyler Tilney, who heads Merrill's energy investment-banking department and directly oversees the firm's dealing with Enron on corporate-finance matters, the people said.
Though each executive invested less than $1 million, the people said, their involvement highlights the role played by senior Wall Street officials in helping to create some of the partnerships Enron used to pad its earnings and hide debt from investors -- and that eventually resulted in huge losses that led to the energy-trading company's downfall. 
Mr. Davis, Mr. Tilney and Mr. Bayly didn't return calls for comment. Joseph Cohen, a Merrill spokesman, said the investments were entirely appropriate, and common on Wall Street. 
The personal investments were part of a total of $22 million Merrill and its officials committed to invest in the partnership, known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. This partnership was particularly controversial because it allowed some Enron officials to make far more money working part time on the partnerships than they did working full time for Enron. The energy company has estimated, for instance, that Andrew Fastow, whom Enron replaced as chief financial officer in October as pressures on the company mounted, made more than $30 million since 1999 running LJM2 and a smaller partnership, called LJM Cayman LP. 
At issue for Merrill is the potential for conflicts of interest. Merrill, like other Wall Street firms, wore a number of hats with Enron: The securities firm acted at various times as securities underwriter and investor with the energy company. Since 1990, Merrill was among the top five underwriters of Enron's stock and bond deals, according to Thomson Financial, earning fees for helping to raise about $3.7 billion in securities issues for the company. Thus, some critics question whether Merrill officials would let their personal investments with Enron entities interfere with their business decisions in dealing with the energy company. 
""Merrill's involvement as underwriter for Enron and its executives' investments raises serious conflict-of-interest questions,"" says Jacob Zamansky, a New York-based plaintiffs' lawyer. ""It gives the appearance that Merrill did this to get Enron deals. Merrill had a vested interest in . . . the partnership and investing"" in it. 
There are other conflicts as well, securities lawyers say. Some top executives at Merrill declined to invest their money because they believed that the Enron partnership -- which kept assets off Enron's balance sheet -- wouldn't get the best investments, which would be kept by the corporate parent. Another concern: Enron's Mr. Fastow suggested the idea of investing in the partnership to Mr. Tilney, whose wife until last week was a managing director of Enron's energy-services unit. Mr. Fastow through a spokesman had no comment. 
It is unclear if top Merrill executives, who also worked on Enron's financings, had more information about the nature of the LJM2 partnership than Merrill's individual customers who were offered opportunities to invest in the partnership. ""I'm not saying that Merrill violated the law here,"" says John Coffee, a professor of securities law at Columbia University in New York. ""But this is a big public-policy issue. Merrill has an obligation, because Enron is a client, not to reveal some confidential information, but it also has a fiduciary obligation to its investors to tell them if these securities aren't suitable for them."" 
Mr. Cohen, the Merrill spokesman, brushes aside such concerns. ""The investment partnership was reviewed and deemed appropriate by parties on all sides of the transaction,"" Mr. Cohen said, reading from a prepared statement. ""Consistent with common industry practice, it was offered to qualified external as well as internal investors, and this is not a conflict of interest."" 
Mr. Cohen added that Merrill high-net-worth clients ""in the partnership offering were given the same information as all Merrill executives who wanted to invest."" 
Mr. Davis, who at the time of the investment headed the institutional-securities group, appears to be the only official on Merrill's executive committee to have invested in the partnership. Even though close to 100 Merrill executives invested in the partnership, neither Chief Executive Officer David Komansky nor his heir apparent, President E. Stanley O'Neal, were in the group, people close to the deal said. One person with knowledge of the matter said some top executives balked at investing their own money because they were uncomfortable with some LJM2 investments. Mr. Davis, however, headed the institutional group, which counted Enron as one of its big clients. 
Merrill, which helped market LJM2 to more than three dozen institutional and individual investors, was only one of many Wall Street firms to invest in the $386.6 million partnership. Other corporate investors in the partnership included Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., two units of Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., First Union Corp. and the CIBC World Markets unit of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. 
The funds for a $15 million investment from J.P. Morgan Chase came from the private-equity unit of J.P. Morgan, which invests the firm's own funds. While individual Morgan bankers may have stakes in those funds, they didn't have any direct, separate stakes in LJM2, a spokeswoman said. 
At Citigroup and Lehman Brothers, which committed $10 million each, and CIBC World Markets, which committed $15 million, the funds came from the firms' own assets and not from outside clients or individual investment bankers, according to people familiar with the investments. 
Officials declined to comment at CSFB, a unit of Credit Suisse Group, whose DLJ Fund Investment Partners III LP made a $5 million commitment, while a CSFB affiliate named Merchant Capital Inc. committed $10 million. Company representatives had no comment at Deutsche Bank, where an affiliate of its former Bankers Trust unit, BT Investment Partners, committed $10 million, and First Union, whose First Union Investors Inc. committed $25 million. 
Officials at some of these Wall Street firms said their investment committees felt pressured to make the investments in order to stay in the running for investment-banking assignments. Some bankers were concerned about whether they were being asked to make uneconomical investments in corporate castoffs that wouldn't appreciate in value. Indeed, it is unclear what returns, if any, the LJM2 partnership investment has generated for limited partners and investors. 
Wall Street securities firms have long made investments associated with their investment-banking business. Sometimes the investments are made to provide extra capital to help clients complete deals. Sometimes the investments are used to acquire an asset a client wants to sell. The funds may come from the securities firm itself, from investment clients, or individuals at the firm who may be offered the chance to make the investments as part of their compensation packages. 
What was unusual about the Merrill investment in the Enron vehicle was that some senior bankers chose not to participate out of concern about what the partnership would invest in. In addition, some of Merrill's top executives, including Mr. Komansky, Merrill's chief executive, had been embarrassed in 1998 by disclosure that they had taken personal stakes in Long-Term Capital Management, the highflying hedge fund for which Merrill had raised funds and whose near collapse jeopardized the entire U.S. financial system.

How to be an Enron millionaire
According to former colleagues, two executives reaped million-dollar windfalls by investing $6,000 apiece in the company's partnership scam. A case study in corporate rot.
- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Jake Tapper
Jan. 29, 2002 | When she heard that Kristina Mordaunt had been mixed up in Enron's infamous LJM partnership, Julia Murray broke down in tears. 
Murray, an Enron in-house counsel, wasn't known within the firm for such emotional displays. Enron was a hard-charging company that attracted tough-as-nails Type A executives and lawyers. But Kristina Mordaunt, a fellow Enron attorney who had worked in the counsel's office before joining the company's financial division, was Murray's close friend. And the news about her was rather shocking: On Nov. 7, 2001, Mordaunt was fired and escorted from the Enron building in downtown Houston by company security. According to four current or former Enron executives, Mordaunt was fired after the company found that she had made a windfall profit off LJM, one of the controversial -- and possibly illegal -- partnerships set up by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
According to these sources, there is a lesson in Kristina Mordaunt's downfall. The ignominious exit of employees like Mordaunt, who had enjoyed the trust and respect of fellow company attorneys and managers, shows how Enron's corporate culture rotted from within, under the twin pressures of financial ambition and personal greed. 
A few weeks before Mordaunt was fired, Enron had announced that her former boss Fastow was on a ""leave of absence."" But few inside the company expected him back. On Oct. 31, Enron had reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission had upgraded its interest in the company's financial dealings from an inquiry to a formal investigation. Within Enron, the board of directors set up a special internal committee to investigate the company's convoluted finances as well. Soon, according to the four Enron sources, the committee stumbled upon stunning news: Working with Fastow, Mordaunt and Enron treasurer Ben Glisan had invested around $6,000 apiece in LJM, one of the limited partnerships Enron had established to hide its debt. Within a few weeks, they each made approximately $1 million from those investments. Enron later revealed that Fastow himself, the financial wizard behind the partnerships scheme, earned as much as $30 million from his role in managing the partnerships. 
Due to Enron's complex -- some think purposely confusing -- financial arrangements, those numbers could not be confirmed with documentation, though they were reported to Salon by the four current or former Enron executives. A congressional investigator also informed Salon that his committee has been given the same information and is currently trying to verify the charge. 
What is clear is that Mordaunt and Glisan were key members of the team Fastow worked with to set up these questionable partnerships, and they appear to have benefited dramatically. ""Mordaunt, for all practical purposes, was Fastow's lawyer at Enron"" since she was ""the top lawyer in his division,"" at the time, said one former Enron executive. After working for Fastow, Mordaunt later became chief counsel for a separate Enron division called EBS -- which itself was involved in highly questionable accounting activities. 
Mordaunt could not be reached for comment by Salon, but according to a former Enron employee, ""She has told people that she doesn't think she did anything wrong."" 
Glisan declined to comment. ""I've been advised not to talk to anybody,"" he told Salon. Glisan referred calls to his attorney, Hank Schuelke, with the Washington, D.C., law firm Janis Schuelke & Wechsler. Asked about the allegation against Glisan, Bill Shields, an attorney with the firm, said only, ""We're not going to have any comment."" 
So far, according to the congressional investigator, the world knows ""just the tip of the iceberg"" about what drove Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, into the biggest U.S. bankruptcy of all time, depriving investors and employees of at least $1 billion. Up to this point, most of the public's attention has been focused on Enron's political connections and the failure of Wall Street's so-called gatekeepers -- the analysts, banks, credit agencies and analysts -- to sound a warning bell. But the inside story of Enron's corporate culture -- as the company transformed itself from an energy trader whose business was rooted in the physical delivery of gas and electricity into a high-finance wheeler-dealer whose business was primarily manipulating numbers -- is just coming to light. This part of the story is about greed, betrayal and deception -- and its human costs, in broken friendships, ruined careers and worse. 
The apparent suicide of former Enron vice chairman J. Clifford Baxter on Friday might be the most dramatic example so far of this human cost. But Enron's corporate ranks have been suffering many shocks since last fall -- and the revelation about Mordaunt and Glisan was one of them. Many executives were stunned to learn that these two trusted co-workers and friends had been raking in such extraordinary amounts of cash. Though Julia Murray declined to comment to Salon, her tearful reaction to the news about her friend Mordaunt last November indicate the deep emotional wounds inflicted by some of Enron's suddenly rich managers as they grabbed their cash and ran for the door.
""Did I feel betrayed? Yeah, a lot,"" said an Enron executive and friend of both Mordaunt and Glisan who would speak with Salon only on the condition of anonymity. ""I was extremely surprised."" 
After the news about Mordaunt and Glisan broke inside the company, colleagues rushed to see who else might have been involved in the scandal. After Mordaunt was escorted out of the Enron building, said one executive, ""I called a number of people I know who work in the finance division and said, 'Please tell me that you didn't invest in LJM!"" 
LJM along with LJM2 and Chewco have become the most notorious of the shady accounting partnerships set up by Enron. Set up, it is now believed, specifically to hide Enron debt from public scrutiny, the partnerships proved to be the catalyst for Enron's fall. 
On Nov. 8, 2001, the same day the company announced that its financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ""should not be relied upon,"" Enron filed an ""8-K"" form -- an interim document required for certain types of financial events -- with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In that form, <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/> Enron disclosed that some of the ""limited partners"" in the partnerships ""were, at the time of the investment, non-executive officers or employees of Enron."" Enron also announced that it was ""terminating the employment"" of Glisan and Mordaunt for participating in the LJM partnerships. 
""At the time these individuals invested in the limited partnership, LJM1 had ceased entering into new transactions with Enron,"" Enron's 8-K stated. ""However, some pre-existing investments involving LJM1 and Enron were still in effect, and Enron believes that these investments resulted in distributions or payments to LJM1 and to the limited partnership in which these individuals invested."" 
According to the congressional investigator, Mordaunt reaped her LJM windfall after she was approached by an Enron executive, who asked her if she wanted to make some money. Yes, she said. ""Give me a check for $6,000,"" he told her, according to the congressional investigator. Later, the executive asked Mordaunt for her bank account number so he could deposit the proceeds from her investment. ""How much is it?"" she asked. He told her to check her bank account the next day. When she did, she discovered over $1 million had been deposited into her account. The congressional committee is currently investigating the matter. 
The Nov. 8 SEC filing also clarified Fastow's role in the company. He was no longer officially on a leave of absence. He ""is no longer working for Enron,"" the filing stated. 
At a November news conference, then-CEO Kenneth Lay reported that he knew about the partnerships but not about Mordaunt's and Glisan's role in them. 
Asked last week about the allegations against Mordaunt and Glisan, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said, ""I have no idea."" Palmer noted that a special committee had been appointed ""to look into"" such matters. ""I know they're looking into everything surrounding those transactions,"" he said, referring to the partnerships. 
Said another former Enron executive after hearing about Mordaunt's and Glisan's lucrative deals: ""Hillary Clinton should have gone to their school of futures trading."" 
To many of their former colleagues, Mordaunt's and Glisan's closeness to Fastow's suspicious transactions makes things look even worse. ""To many of us, this looks and smells like a bribe,"" said one Enron former employee. ""'I' -- Fastow -- 'will give you money, you shut up.' Or put another way, 'Here is the payoff for helping me set up the structures that helped me rake in more than $30 million.'"" The two weren't merely ""Enron executives,"" the former employee says, ""they were the treasurer and one of the top lawyers in the company. And both of them worked on LJM-related deals. That is what makes it sickening."" 
The accusations highlight the personal betrayal many Enron executives feel. After Mordaunt and Glisan were fired last November, their former colleagues spent much time trying to figure out how it all could have happened. 
Mordaunt, according to a current Enron executive, ""was very tight with Andy [Fastow]. Andy was responsible for making her managing director, and she would have done anything for him."" Nonetheless, as a lawyer, Mordaunt should have known better, the executive said. ""Given his connection with LJM, which was dicey at best and at worst probably illegal, I personally would have stayed far away from it. But you never know how Andy spun it to her."" 
After working as Fastow's top lawyer, Mordaunt later served as chief counsel for EBS, an Enron subsidiary set up specifically to handle another complex partnership, code-named Braveheart. In Braveheart, Enron sold 10 years' worth of future revenue from a broadband interactive television deal it was setting up with Blockbuster. Although the deal itself never went past the testing stage, Enron booked $110 million worth of revenue for selling off those future, never-to-be-realized earnings. 
Glisan also played a key role in Fastow's division, a former Enron executive noted: ""All the deals we did had to go through Glisan and get his approval because of the impact on funds flow."" The former executive, like others affiliated with the firm, said that he once had a positive impression of Glisan and was surprised to learn that he had been an LJM investor. 
To some current and former Enron executives, the transformation of respected managers like Mordaunt and Glisan represented a major shift in the company ethos. ""In my opinion this all goes back to when Jeff Skilling took over and Enron ceased being an energy company and we became an earnings company,"" said one former executive, referring to Enron's metamorphosis into a company that focused more on highly complex financial-derivatives trading than on actual commodities. 
In 1997, Skilling became the company's president and chief operating officer. Press accounts of Enron's rise traditionally gave him credit for Enron's increasing focus on complex financing schemes and risky leaps into such areas as bandwidth trading, an enterprise that ended up costing the company hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Skilling was ""all hype,"" the one-time executive says. ""Everything he did was to hype the stock. And they had this need to create complex financial dealings to hide all the things going wrong. 
""Once we became an earnings-focused company, that was the beginning of the end."" The former executive said he's still unsure whether recently resigned CEO Lay knew everything that was going on. ""But that doesn't excuse him. Captain Joe Hazelwood didn't know that the guy was going to run the Valdez into the reef. But he was Captain Hazelwood. It was his ship."" 
The company's business practices changed under Skilling, this former executive said. And so did the attitudes of managers like Mordaunt and Glisan -- and Lay, for that matter. Keeping the stock price up, at all costs, became the order of the day, even if that meant telling employees all was fine, when in fact the company's situation was rapidly deteriorating. 
""[Lay] lied to us starting in August,"" said the former executive. ""He lied to us."" In August, Lay went before the company and announced that Skilling was resigning for personal reasons. In an all-employees meeting, Lay told a touching tale about why Skilling felt the need to leave the company. 
Skilling, Lay said, had recently visited the Teesside Power Station, Enron's gas-fired power plant in northeast England, where an Aug. 8 explosion and fire had killed three Enron employees. ""It shook him up so much he realized how much he had sacrificed with his own family,"" one executive recalled Lay saying. ""And he wanted to spend more time with his kids."" Lay then told the company more lies, according to the executive: that Enron had just enjoyed the best quarter in its history; that it was going to be more friendly to Wall Street; it was going to simplify its accounting practices; there were no other people other than Fastow involved in the shady partnerships. 
""About two weeks later, the news came out about Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt,"" recalled the executive. Soon afterward, the company was told that ""we would have to restate our earnings for the past five years."" 
Then came the news that executives like Lay had been dumping their stock for years while simultaneously telling stockholders and employees that all was fine and the stock would soon bounce back. In hindsight, few Enron executives believe that Skilling's departure had anything to do with the Teesside Power Station tragedy. 
""Lay got in front of the entire company and just lied,"" said the executive, who has lost his life savings. ""I feel like a schmuck.""

Enron Directors Backed Moving Debt Off Books

Members of Enron Corp.'s board of directors received detailed briefings as early as four years ago about the purpose and structure of controversial partnerships whose losses triggered the company's fall into bankruptcy, according to minutes of the meetings. 
The minutes, which cover four board meetings in 1997 and 1999 and three meetings of the board's finance committee in 2000, suggest that board members approved aggressive accounting actions, including moving debt off the company books.
A dozen congressional committees as well as the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Enron's collapse, which cost investors and employees billions of dollars. A focus of the inquiries is whether Enron hid debt and inflated its profits by using the private partnerships run by its chief financial officer. 
In other Enron-related news yesterday, the General Accounting Office announced that it would sue the White House for access to records of Vice President Cheney's meetings with Enron and other industry interests that sought to influence the administration's energy policy last year. And Stephen Cooper, the interim head of Enron, said he was optimistic the company could survive, though in a much diminished form. 
Individual Enron board members, who themselves are being sued and investigated, have said little publicly about their role in the transactions that toppled the company. The minutes, made available to The Washington Post by a source critical of the board, suggest that the partnerships were a key part of Enron's growth strategy and show they were regularly reviewed by the directors. 
The copies of the minutes do not cover every board meeting and do not include documents that are referred to as being attached to the summaries of the board's actions. 
When it was reported last fall that Andrew Fastow, the Enron CFO, made $30 million running partnerships with names such as LJM, Raptor and JEDI, then-chairman Kenneth L. Lay announced that the board was setting up a special committee to investigate. The minutes show that members of that special committee attended board meetings in which Fastow described the intricacy of the entities. 
Sources said the committee's report, which is expected to be completed as early as tomorrow, will say that while the Enron board approved the partnerships, management and auditors withheld key information from them. That is expected to be the key element of the defense that will be offered by Lay and board member William C. Powers Jr. when they testify before Congress on Monday, sources said. Last night, Robert Bennett, a Washington lawyer representing Enron, gave every indication that would be the case. 
""While the board of directors, including Mr. Lay, were aware that these special partnership entities were being set up, which were being run by Mr. Fastow, there is a great deal of information regarding their operation and execution that was unknown to the board of directors,"" Bennett said. 
At an Oct. 11, 1999, board meeting, Fastow discussed the company's mix of ""on-balance and off-balance sheet debt,"" according to the minutes. At another meeting on May 1, 2000, Fastow told board members about the risk of ""accounting scrutiny"" on the Raptor partnership. 
A board resolution in October 1999 said one purpose of the LJM2 partnership was to create ""a potential ready purchaser of the company's businesses and assets."" A chart labeled ""LJM2 Update,"" attached to the agenda for a May 2000 finance committee meeting, said the partnership had made seven investments, all purchased from Enron. 
Enron has disclosed that the board waived the company's conflict-of-interest rules to let Fastow oversee the partnerships. 
The board's special committee hired William R. McLucas, former head of enforcement at the SEC, to do the investigation and write a report for the committee. The report is expected to be released before Lay, who resigned last week, and board member Powers, who is also dean of the University of Texas law school, testify before Congress on Monday. 
Until now, Congress has focused on the role Enron's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, played in the company's collapse and the reported destruction by Andersen executives of Enron-related documents. Monday's hearings are expected to zero in on the behavior of Enron officials, including the board. 
The outside directors are expected, as part of their defense, to push the focus back on Andersen, sources say. They will point, for example, to portions of board minutes that say Andersen ""had spent considerable time analyzing . . . the governance structure"" of one of the partnerships, LJM2, and ""was comfortable with the proposed transaction."" 
Minutes from October 1999 and October 2000 say the board ordered several safeguards be implemented to maintain control of the partnerships. One was allowing Lay or the board to remove Fastow from one partnership, LJM, at any time. Another was directing then-Enron chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling and others to review all transactions between Enron and LJM. And Skilling was to review Fastow's ""economic interest"" in the partnership. 
Bennett said, ""We have learned that many of the procedures that were put into place to ensure the appropriate operation of these entities were not complied with, without the knowledge of the board."" 
Patrick McGurn of Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. of Rockville, which advises large shareholders on corporate-governance issues, said last night that the minutes seem to provide more evidence that board members were fully informed of the company's aggressive financial strategies. 
""If that's not the case, the directors better start talking and start talking now. Every step along the way it seems this board had the opportunity to say no to the partnerships, to the waiver of the ethics code, and each time they had an opportunity to take the right fork in the road, they took the wrong fork."" 
The Oct. 12, 1999, minutes show that outside director Herbert Winokur -- now a member of the board's special investigating committee -- recommended that the board approve Fastow's participation in the LJM2 partnership. 
McGurn said, ""The first principle of an investigation is that the people who presumably might be held responsible at the end of the day can't investigate themselves."" 
The other two members of the special committee -- Powers and Raymond S. Troubh, a New York consultant -- had no involvement with the company when the formation of the off-balance-sheet entities took place, sources close to the company said. 
W. Neil Eggleston, an attorney for the outside directors of the board, said Winokur has no conflict of interest in serving on that special committee, despite his role in approving the partnership deals. ""It was important for the special committee to render its report quickly and Mr. Winokur's participation provided continuity and speed to the special committee's efforts,"" Eggleston said. 
The board minutes show that as early as Dec. 9, 1997, Enron's executive committee approved a buyout -- that included a corporate guarantee of $633 million -- of the interest of the California public employees pension fund in the JEDI partnership. 
At an Aug. 7, 2000, meeting of the finance committee, chaired by Winokur, the off-balance-sheet partnerships are described as ""the vehicles the company was utilizing to manage its balance sheet debt."" Directors Wendy Gramm and Lay were among other board members that also attended the meeting. 
At a special board meeting on June 28, 1999, Lay called on Skilling to discuss a proposed investment partnership. ""Mr. Skilling noted that due to changes in the accounting treatment of off-balance-sheet transactions, the company had been analyzing new types of financing vehicles. He called on Mr. Fastow to discuss the proposal."" 
Skilling resigned suddenly in August. Fastow was ousted in October. 
The LJM partnerships were specifically cited by the company last fall when it admitted violating some accounting standards, resulting in a $586 million overstatement of its profits between 1997 and 2001. 
The excerpts that became available yesterday give no hint that board members had questions or qualms about the accounting maneuvers, with the exception of Fastow's dual role as Enron's chief financial officer and LJM's manager. 
Staff writers David Hilzenrath, Albert B. Crenshaw and Carrie Johnson contributed to this report. Peter Behr reported from Houston.

Concerned ex-worker was sent to human resources
House panel asks Lay to explain what happened to memo from former energy services manager 
By JULIE MASON 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
Jan. 30, 2002, 10:04PM
WASHINGTON -- A one-time Enron Corp. manager who warned Chairman Ken Lay in August about questionable accounting practices was sent to human resources for a talk about employee morale, her attorney said Wednesday. 
House investigators demand Lay explain Enron's response to allegations raised in an Aug. 28 e-mail by Margaret Ceconi, who had lost her job with Enron Energy Services just over three weeks earlier. 
""Ms. Ceconi included her home phone number in the e-mail and offered to speak to board members,"" lawmakers from the House Energy and Commerce Committee said in a letter to Lay. ""We are very interested in learning what happened to Ms. Ceconi's e-mail after you received it, and how Enron responded to it."" 
An Enron spokesman did not return a call for comment. 
A key issue for investigators probing the collapse of Enron is at what point executives at the company became aware of financial problems and how those problems were addressed. 
Ceconi on Aug. 28 wrote a five-page memo to Lay, stating that losses in Enron Energy Services, or EES, were being moved to another sector of Enron to make EES appear profitable. 
According to Ceconi, the losses were hidden in Enron Wholesale Services, the company's highly profitable and well-established trading arm. 
""Some would say the house of cards are falling,"" Ceconi said in her memo to Lay. 
Demetrios Anaipakos, Ceconi's Houston attorney, said Lay never met with Ceconi to discuss her concerns, and she was instead referred to human resources. 
""During that meeting, the primary discussion was focused on concerns over employee morale at Enron,"" Anaipakos said. 
Ceconi's memo, which was copied to a manager in human resources, detailed morale problems and related issues at EES. 
Ceconi was told her accounting allegations would be taken seriously and investigated by Enron, but she never heard back, according to her lawyer. 
""Ms. Ceconi firmly believes the allegations she raised in her memo merited response from the company, and she didn't get one,"" Anaipakos said. 
The House Energy and Commerce Committee sent Lay 10 questions pertaining to Ceconi's memo and the company's response. Lay has until Feb. 12 to respond. 
Questions posed to Lay in a letter signed by Rep. W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin, R-La., committee chairman, and other members seek details on how the memo was distributed and whether Ceconi's allegations were investigated. 
The Ceconi memo was dated two weeks after Sherron Watkins, also a former Enron executive, wrote to Lay her concerns about accounting problems and a possible ""wave of accounting scandals"" at Enron. 
In response, Enron officials sought a limited outside review of Watkins' allegations by the law firm of Vinson & Elkins. 
The lawyers' report concluded that Watkins' concerns did not warrant an in-depth investigation. 
Ceconi's memo, also copied to the board, included a litany of personal criticisms of Enron management and even some jabs at Lay. 
The somewhat disorganized memo is at times angry and confrontational. 
In it, Ceconi complains that one supervisor ""had the coffee machines taken off the floors because it was too expensive. Maybe if you got rid of the company jets you could afford coffee."" 
Ceconi also complained in it that she had been heavily recruited to move to Houston from Dallas and still hadn't been reimbursed for all her moving expenses. 
When the memo surfaced last week, a spokesman for Enron characterized it as the work of a disgruntled employee. 
Ceconi also expressed specific concerns about possible malfeasance in EES accounting. 
EES was formed to help companies manage and reduce energy costs. By securing fixed prices through long-term contracts, EES helped customers maintain predictable supplies at stable costs. It also provided energy audits and helped companies improve energy efficiency. 
The division didn't begin to report profits until late in 2000, but then revenues steadily improved. 
In the first quarter of 2001, it reported profits of $40 million. In the second quarter, $60 million in profit was reported on more than $7 billion in contracts. 
The division's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing lists $2.5 billion in assets, mainly its contracts with companies and organizations, and $2.1 billion in debts. 
Lay is expected to testify Monday before a Senate committee probing Enron, one of at least 10 congressional investigations under way into the collapse of Enron. 
The Labor Department and Securities and Exchange Commission also are investigating Enron, and the Justice Department is conducting a criminal probe. 
A central point of inquiry is how Enron was able to shield its debt and appear more profitable than it was. 
The company, formerly the nation's seventh-largest, on Dec. 2 filed the largest corporate bankruptcy in history.

2nd Enron warning disclosed ; Manager wrote to board about losses, practices

An internal Enron Corp. e-mail sent from a midlevel manager to the company's board of directors warned last August of hidden losses totaling more than $500 million or more, false accounting practices and flagrant mismanagement within the doomed energy company's upper ranks. 
The e-mail was sent to Enron's board of directors by Margaret Ceconi, a laid-off manager for Enron Energy Services. It is the second in-house correspondence in which an employee made specific allegations of possible illegal activity in the months leading up to Enron's failure.
The company, burdened by off-balance-sheet transactions that hid millions of dollars of debt, filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, leaving thousands of employees and shareholders in the lurch. Top executives, though, cashed in hundreds of millions of dollars in stock they held in the months leading up to Enron's collapse. 
In her Aug. 29 e-mail, Ceconi warned Enron's directors, ""Some would say the house of cards are falling. You are potentially facing shareholder lawsuits, employee lawsuits, heat from analysts and newspapers. The market has lost all confidence, and it's obvious why."" 
The House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is investigating Enron's failure and the role of its accountant, Chicago-based Andersen, released Ceconi's letter Wednesday. 
Peggy Mahoney, an Enron Energy Services spokeswoman, would say only that Ceconi's letter ""is not based on the facts."" 
Enron Energy Services, a free-standing Enron unit, offered long- term energy contracts to more than 28,500 commercial and industrial customers. 
The unit pioneered corporate energy outsourcing, a service that includes negotiating a company's electricity and gas contracts in regulated and deregulated markets, paying company energy bills, and installing energy-efficient ventilation, heating and cooling systems. 
Enron Energy Services' clients included major grocery store chains and retailers such as J.C. Penney Co. and Saks Inc. Chicago customers included Quaker Oats Co. and the Archdiocese of Chicago. 
Stephanie Brown, a J.C. Penney spokeswoman, said that the retail chain had saved money with its energy services contract in 2001 and had been prepared to keep it. But Enron Energy Services, one of Enron's many bankrupt units, moved to terminate the contract earlier this week. 
In her e-mail, Ceconi said Enron Energy Services had lost $60 million on the J.C. Penney contract alone. 
""From our perspective, the Enron Energy Services' deals seemed too good to be true,"" said Craig Sieben, chief executive of Sieben Energy Associates, a Chicago-based energy management consulting firm. ""The professional salespeople presenting the deals seemed messianic in their beliefs, but could not explain how Enron was making money, except to say, `Trust us.' 
""It was a deal-oriented culture, with the salespeople making big bonuses when they closed sales. Servicing the deals and executing the contract successfully got short shrift."" 
Many promises made 
In fact, Ceconi's e-mail accused Enron Energy Services of promising more than it could deliver, a method of operating that angered clients such as Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., which signed a 10-year energy management agreement with Enron Energy Services in September 2000. 
Starwood had set aside $45 million to invest in energy-saving technology. But Enron did not deploy the capital, much to Starwood's chagrin, said Sieben, a consultant to Starwood on the deal. 
""We always knew that the salespeople did not understand the energy business, and that scared us,"" Sieben said. ""The focus was on get the business."" 
Ceconi said losses reached at least $500 million, and perhaps $1 billion, all of it hidden when the division's ""risk group"" merged with its ""wholesale group."" 
""You should check on the Safeway contract, Albertson's, IBM and the California contracts that are being renegotiated,"" she wrote to the board. ""It will add up to over $500MM that EES is losing and trying to hide in Wholesale. Rumor on the 7th floor is that it is closer to $1 Billion."" 
Ceconi noted that Enron Energy Services, to ""everyone's amazement, reported earnings"" for the second quarter. She then noted that the company ""has knowingly mispresented EES' earnings,"" in violation of Financial Accounting Standards Rule 131. 
""This is common knowledge among all the EES employees, and is actually joked about,"" her e-mail states. ""But it should be taken seriously."" 
Market analysts, including Carol Coale of Prudential Securities Research, ""are continuing to push this issue very hard,"" Ceconi warned. 
Company would not talk 
In an interview Wednesday, Coale said she had suspected that Enron was concealing losses. But the company would not confirm those suspicions, and its customers refused to discuss their contracts. 
""Houston is a small big town,"" Coale said. ""We had heard about that, that kind of information was being talked about in the marketplace. But Enron said, `No.'"" 
Coale said Ceconi later contacted her, and on Nov. 4 provided her with a copy of the e-mail. 
By then, though, Enron was struggling to stay afloat. 
Ceconi sent her warning to the board shortly after Jeffrey Skilling abruptly ended his brief stint as Enron's chief executive. 
""One can only surmise that the removal of Jeff Skilling was an action taken by the board to correct the wrongdoings of the various management teams at Enron,"" Ceconi wrote. ""However, based on my experience at this company, I'm sure that board has only scratched the surface of the impending problems that plague Enron at the moment (i.e. EES's management's incapability's of strategic planning, hiding losses/SEC violations, fraudulent recruiting practices, lack of product, etc).""

Enron's Acting CEO Says Energy Trader Can Be Salvaged
By Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp.'s acting chief executive said he believes that the troubled energy company is salvageable, and he pledged to move ""at light speed"" to get it out of bankruptcy court. 
Yet the surviving corporation that he described -- one ""dedicated to movement of natural gas and generation of electricity"" -- would be tiny, even when compared with the Enron of a decade ago. In fact, it would resemble the very thing that Enron has disparaged in recent years: a utility.
In a conference call with reporters yesterday, acting CEO Stephen Cooper said his primary motivation is to maximize value for creditors and ""preserve as many jobs as possible. . . . There are a lot of people here that deserve our best shot at reorganizing this company."" 
Mr. Cooper, a restructuring expert whose 20-year-old firm, Zolfo Cooper, has presided over many of the nation's biggest bankruptcies, was named to the Enron job on Tuesday. He succeeds Kenneth Lay, who resigned last week. Houston-based Enron continues to search for a new chairman, a position also formerly held by Mr. Lay. 
Asked about the questionable off-balance-sheet transactions and accounting practices that sank Enron, Mr. Cooper declined to comment. ""Not only do I not know"" what brought the company down, he said, ""but it's literally of no interest to me."" 
Nor would Mr. Cooper speculate about the prospects for liquidation. When you ""liquidate in a situation like this,"" he said, ""you have the patina of distress"" that pulls down the prices that assets might otherwise fetch. 
Mr. Cooper did acknowledge that the company's creditors, in the end, are likely to be treated disparately because of the ""extensive nature of the legal entities in the Enron universe."" In other words, Enron pledged so many assets to so many different companies, especially as it created a web of off-balance-sheet partnerships, many creditors may find there isn't enough left to meet their claims. 
If it does emerge from bankruptcy proceedings, Enron is likely to be a fraction of its former size. Mr. Cooper said he envisions a company ""based on hard assets with predictable revenues and cash flow."" That is precisely the business model that, until recently, Enron rejected as old-fashioned as it pushed into a world of ""virtual assets,"" anchored by a massive energy-trading operation. Meanwhile, Enron this month lost its biggest and most profitable hard asset -- the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline -- as a condition of its failed merger agreement with rival Dynegy Inc. 
Turning to another matter, Mr. Cooper said he expects the results of a special internal investigation, launched as the company slid toward bankruptcy late last year, to be released in coming days. He said senior executives would take ""whatever actions are appropriate"" in consultation with the creditors' committee to respond to the report's findings. The investigation has been conducted with assistance from William McLucas, former enforcement chief at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and accountants from Deloitte & Touche LLP. Mr. McLucas is now an attorney with the firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering in Washington. 
Also yesterday, Enron President Jeff McMahon said the company is continuing to interview accounting firms, looking for a replacement for Arthur Andersen LLP.

Cooper hits ground running

Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Jan. 31, 2002, 10:18AM
Enron's new chief executive officer said he has no interest in finding out who's to blame for what went wrong at the energy giant, but will instead focus on revitalizing the business and preserving jobs. 
Stephen Cooper, who was named interim CEO and chief restructuring officer on Tuesday, told reporters in a conference call he plans to rebuild the company around a number of international and domestic power plants and natural gas facilities, operations that will have predictable revenues and cash flow. 
Most of the company's trading operations are being sold to Swiss bank UBS Warburg, while other long-term service contracts the company has under divisions such as Enron Energy services will also be sold or unwound. 
Cooper, a bankruptcy recovery specialist who has helped companies such as Federated Department Stores and Laidlaw, the owner of Greyhound Lines, dig themselves out of trouble, said his job will not to be to investigate the company's past. 
""The good news is not only do I not know what went wrong, it is literally of no interest to me,"" Cooper said. ""I'm not going to spend my time looking in the rearview mirror, because there are a lot of people here who deserve our best shot of preserving this company."" 
In addition to the 10 congressional investigations and other government agency probes into Enron, a special committee of Enron's board of directors is expected to issue the results of its own investigation within the next week. Appropriate disciplinary actions will be taken against employees if necessary, Cooper said, but he didn't know the full extent of those actions. 
Cooper seemed to waste little time in getting to work at Enron. He had met with the Enron board of directors even before being named to the job this week and canceled a Wednesday morning conference call with reporters because of another internal meeting that was running long. 
""He's jumped right into the reorganization,"" said Enron lawyer Brian S. Rosen in New York. ""He's already working on a plan."" 
That quick start is what's needed if Enron is to meet an early April deadline to present federal bankruptcy Judge Arthur Gonzalez with a reorganization plan. Companies have 120 days from the date of a bankruptcy filing to submit a reorganization plan, leaving Enron with about 60 days. 
Rosen said it's too early determine whether the company will seek an extension from Gonzalez, but they are commonly granted in complicated bankruptcy cases. 
Cooper said the restructuring will move ""at light speed,"" as he plans to spend the first month assessing the company's assets, debts and liabilities. He estimates that the company owes unsecured creditors about $30 billion and secured creditors around $10 billion. 
The company will continue to sell off hard assets around the world and divest itself of all operations related to trading, Cooper said, leaving a business that is much smaller yet more stable. 
""One of the beauties"" of Chapter 11 bankruptcy ""is at the end of the day we'll be able to compress our debt against the total economic value of the remaining company,"" Cooper said. ""This will give us the opportunity to put the company back in equilibrium with its capital structure."" 
Enron is trying to protect some of the gains it may have made on trading contracts, but creditors would have to approve such a move, Cooper said. 
Enron can expect some cash to pay off creditors from selling some of its $7.5 billion in international assets it reportedly had as of late last year, including power plants, pipelines and other operations in more than a dozen countries. 
Enron has buyers lined up for many of those assets, most recently signing a deal Tuesday with Sempra Energy Trading to sell its London-based metal trading business, Enron Metals Group, for $145 million. 
Other assets for sale include: Wessex Water, a U.K.-based water and wastewater utility, which could sell for as much as $1.5 billion, about $700 million shy of how much Enron paid for it in 1997; Enron's 43 percent ownership stake in the Teeside power plant in England, which could get between $200 million and $300 million; and its majority stake in the $2.9 billion, 2,184-megawatt Dabhol power plant project and Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd. 
The company is also searching for an auditor to replace accounting firm Arthur Andersen, said Enron Chief Operating Officer Jeff McMahon. Andersen, the firm that has worked with Enron for more than a decade and has given the company the stamp of approval on dozens of questionable off-balance-sheet partnerships, stopped working with Enron last week. 
""We're in the process of talking to other accounting firms to determine where there are conflicts of interest,"" McMahon said.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE
A Strategy Of Returning To the Roots In Energy
By NEELA BANERJEE

01/31/2002
The New York Times
Page 6, Column 6
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 30 -- To survive bankruptcy, the Enron Corporation plans to return to its roots, mainly by concentrating on a small collection of hard assets like natural gas pipelines and power plants, Stephen F. Cooper, the company's interim chief executive, said today. 
Despite a widespread belief among industry analysts that Enron should be liquidated because so little of value remains, Mr. Cooper argued that creditors, employees and others would benefit more by slimming the company rather than shutting it down. He said the new senior management team at Enron would spend the next month sorting out which businesses might prove the most viable parts in a reorganized company.
But the group seems to have already decided that the core of a new Enron would be what the company had been before it developed its aggressive and varied trading operations: a transporter of natural gas. 
''We will certainly be a smaller company,'' Mr. Cooper said during a conference call with reporters today. ''We will be a company based on hard assets and very predictable revenues.'' 
Enron's creditors have said they want to extract the maximum value from the company's assets through the bankruptcy process. Mr. Cooper appeared to be endorsing the view of company insiders that while some assets should be sold to pay debts, reorganizing Enron and giving creditors equity in the new company would be the best way to answer those demands. 
''When you liquidate in a situation like this, you have the patina of distress,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''People try to put you over a barrel. They do put you over a barrel, and the size of that barrel runs from a normal wine cask up to the giant-sized cask that you have for brandy.'' 
Mr. Cooper, a managing partner at the New York firm of Zolfo Cooper, which specializes in salvaging bankrupt companies, was only appointed on Tuesday, endorsed by the main creditors committee and Enron's board. He said the company would conduct the reorganization at ''light speed,'' but he declined to provide a timetable and few specifics. 
Despite the intense scrutiny and investigations that have buffeted Enron, he said, the company still had a solid customer base for its business of providing gas and electricity. That, in turn, gives Enron some crucial cash flow for the revamping process. 
Mr. Cooper also said that a report of the results of the internal investigation into the past financial practices that led to Enron's collapse, led by the dean of the University of Texas School of Law, William Powers Jr., would be issued some time in the next three to six days. 
The company had said previously that it would make its findings known by next Monday, when the former chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was scheduled to testify before Congress. 
Mr. Cooper said that Enron officials would only decide upon disciplinary action once they had reviewed the investigation's findings. 
''There will be no secrets here,'' he said. 
The new vision Mr. Cooper offered for Enron is a tacit, and perhaps unintentional, rebuke of the strategy the company followed throughout much of the 1990's as it transformed itself into the leading energy trader around the world. Mr. Lay and his protege, Jeffrey K. Skilling, fashioned a company they trumpeted as light on assets like pipelines and power plants. This ''virtual'' company, they said, would make its money from being smarter and quicker off the mark than the competition. The company focused on the fast-moving world of trading the many things it approached as commodities, from traditional products like gas and power to the innovative arcana of water and weather derivatives. 
But Mr. Cooper emphatically refused to speculate on what brought Enron down. 
''It's literally of no interest to me,'' he said. ''I'm not going to spend time here looking in the rear-view mirror.''

Enron Interim CEO: More Value From Restructuring Assets
By Christina Cheddar

Dow Jones News Service

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) newly appointed interim chief executive, Stephen Cooper, said he believes Enron can be restructured as a natural gas pipeline and power distribution company.
""I don't see this as a liquidation,"" Cooper said, addressing the media in a conference call held late Wednesday. 
Cooper, a restructuring expert who heads consulting firm Zolfo Cooper LLC in New York, replaced Kenneth Lay, who resigned last week under pressure from the bankrupt company's creditors committee. 
Cooper is charged with restructuring a company that has already shed what was once its core business. Enron sold its energy trading and marketing business, which once accounted for 90% of its $100 billion in revenue in 2000, to Swiss bank UBS AG (UBS). The sale leaves behind a portfolio of gas pipelines and power plants. 
""My view ... is in a successful restructuring you deliver more value to your economic stakeholders,"" Cooper said, ""Regardless of how effectively you run a liquidation, that liquidation has ... a patina of distress."" 
The executive was joined on the call by other members from the newly created office of the chief executive, President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff McMahon and Chief Financial Officer Ray Bowen. 
Since the start of Enron's financial crisis, both McMahon and Bowen have vaulted up the ranks at the Houston company. The two were promoted Tuesday to the positions they currently hold. McMahon previously was Enron's chief financial officer, while Bowen was treasurer. 
Enron is still looking for a new chairman to replace the post left vacant by Lay's departure. Lay remains on Enron's board. 
According to Cooper, Enron has $40 billion in total debt, but of the total $10 billion is nonrecourse, project debt. That leaves $30 billion in debt that is owed to unsecured creditors, according to the executive. 
On the matter of Enron's past missteps, Enron's Cooper was very clear. 
""It's literally not of interest to me. ... I will spend little to zero of my time worried about the past...I frankly don't care,"" he said. 
In the 30-minute call, company officials declined to answer questions not related to restructuring. 
Enron still employs some 19,000 people. Cooper said he hopes to be able to save as many jobs as possible. 
Cooper will begin to assess which assets will become Enron's ongoing business, and since the company no longer has trading operations, that business will provide Enron with a new identity. Then, employees will be assigned to the ongoing operations. 
Cooper also plans to consider assets for sale. This process had already begun under the company's previous management. 
To date, Enron has agreed to sell a variety of assets, including $520 million in long-term contracts, and its London-based metals trading business to Sempra Energy Trading, a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy (SRE) for $145 million. 
Prior to the bankruptcy filing, Enron was in the process of selling Oregon utility Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN) for about $3 billion. 
Following the break-up of its merger with Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Enron had to cede control of its Northwest Natural Gas pipeline to Dynegy Inc. (DYN), but it does have an option to repurchase the asset. 
With these divestitures, both completed and in progress, Cooper admitted Enron would be a ""substantially smaller enterprise.""

Enron's new turnaround specialist discusses strategy for bringing firm back from bankruptcy
By KRISTEN HAYS
Associated Press Writer

HOUSTON (AP) - The man tapped to lead Enron Corp. out of the biggest bankruptcy in history said he won't be distracted by the myriad of investigations into the company's collapse. 
Stephen Cooper, Enron's new interim chief executive and chief restructuring officer, said Wednesday during his second day on the job that he was focused on Enron's future, not its past, and planned to move forward ""at light speed"" in reorganizing what's left of the company.
Cooper said in a conference call with reporters that he was certain Enron could be saved even as rival Dynegy Inc. prepares to acquire one of its most prized assets, the 16,500-mile (26,550-kilometer) Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, by Friday. Enron also is transferring its once-envied trading operation to Swiss investment bank UBS Warburg. 
He said Enron will be left with all or part ownership of three smaller pipelines and officials are reviewing whether other businesses can be preserved or should be sold to help pay creditors. 
Cooper said Enron's businesses and customer base remain adequate for the company to someday emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, although smaller and without its once-flagship trading venture. 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy frees a company from the threat of creditors' lawsuits while it reorganizes its finances. The debtor usually retains control of the business and its assets. 
""We will be substantially smaller from a revenue perspective, but we will be a substantial entity in the context of the movement of natural gas and liquids to our pipelines,"" he said. 
Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2. More than 5,000 employees were laid off, and most lost retirement nest eggs that were loaded with company stock. 
Enron crashed amid revelations of questionable accounting practices. Earnings were restated, eliminating millions in profits since 1997. The value of shares plummeted to less than a dollar from roughly dlrs 80 a year ago. 
Cooper, 55, is a managing principal of Zolfo Cooper, a New York-based reorganization adviser. The firm's past clients include Trans World Airlines, Polaroid Corp. and retailer Liberty House. 
Cooper succeeds Kenneth Lay, former chairman and CEO, who resigned last week. Lay said the numerous investigations into Enron's swift collapse were preventing him from running the company efficiently. 
Cooper refused to say how many additional job cuts were planned, saying the ultimate goal ""is to preserve as many jobs as possible within the context of the reorganized entity. It is going to take some time to sort that out."" 
In the end, he said the new Enron will be much like the natural gas pipeline company formed in 1985 with the merger of Houston Natural Gas and Omaha, Neb.-based InterNorth. 
After Enron was formed, the company increasingly took on new ventures. It started trading energy and created markets for other commodities, such as pulp, paper, bandwidth and weather futures. 
Anthony Sabino, an associate professor of law who specializes in bankruptcy and oil, gas and energy issues at St. John's University, said those innovations could be Enron's undoing. 
""They were playing with dynamite and it blew up in their faces,"" he said. ""No doubt, if Enron is to survive it will be as a mere shadow of itself and staying away from things that got it into trouble in the first place.""

City - Enron dogged by talk of price manipulation.
By Simon English.

The Daily Telegraph

(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2002

in New York 
ENRON is facing a fresh investigation into allegations it manipulated electricity prices in California at the height of America's power crisis last year.
The latest blow to the crippled energy trader sees watchdogs join politicians in demanding a full inquiry. 
Nora Brownell of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said: ""If there was market manipulation, we need to find it and we need to deal with it."" 
Enron denies suggestions it was profiteering by inflating the cost of supplying electricity to power companies last year. Data presented to senators shows that wholesale power prices fell by a third on December 3, the day after Enron filed for bankruptcy. 
As embarrassment mounts daily for directors of Enron, it emerged that a member of staff asked the disgraced chairman Kenneth Lay, who quit last week, if he was smoking crack. 
At a videoed staff meeting on October 23, the day after the company reported losses of more than $600m, one furious employee asked in a written question read out by Mr Lay: ""I would like to know if you are on crack. If so that would explain a lot."" 
To laughter, Mr Lay said: ""I think that's probably not a very happy employee"" and went on to pledge that the company share price would bounce back. 
""I ask you to recommit to the company and do the very best job you can. We will come through this stronger,"" he told thousands of staff. 
The latest development on the allegations of document destruction that hound both Enron and auditors Andersen saw the company admit it was employing a commercial shredding firm until mid-January. It was destroying old payroll and medical records not connected to any congressional or criminal investigations, said Enron. 
James Greenwood, the chairman of one of the congressional inquiries, was aghast. ""It is stunning that this company would get anywhere near a shredder without at least seeking the permission of the Justice Department,"" he said.

Andersen CEO: Significant Information Not Made Available

01/31/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Arthur Andersen (X.AND) still doesn't have all the answers on what with wrong during the final days before energy giant Enron (ENRNQ) declared bankruptcy, Chief Executive Officer Joe Berardino said Thursday on Good Morning America. 
""Very significant information was not made available to our people,"" he said.
When asked about its role in Enron's demise, Berardino said that Andersen was only the auditor for Enron, not running it. Andersen didn't make judgments on what investments to make and not to make; Andersen was there to help a company report its financial results, he said. 
Berardino said that all during 2001, Enron's stock was going down even before the accounting issues became known. 
Andersen is still investigating who did what, the CEO said on the television program. He said the only wrongdoing it knows of for certain was that by David Duncan, Andersen's lead auditor on the Enron account, who was fired by Andersen. 
""When we get to the bottom of this. We will be forthcoming, as we have been from day one,"" Berardino said. The company will deal with any misbehavior or bad judgments that it comes across, such as shredding documents or misleading others and he said Andersen will report its findings. 
""We will get through this,"" he said, referring to Arthur Andersen. 
After the current Enron situation is over, ""People will get to know the real Arthur Andersen,"" he said.

Evidence likely lingers amid high-tech shreds

It's been two weeks since the Andersen accounting firm fired David Duncan, the man being blamed for its Enron document-shredding orgy. 
Duncan, who was Andersen's lead partner on the Enron account, is the guy Andersen says led a team in destroying ""a very substantial volume of documents and e-mails"" relating to Enron.
According to Andersen's testimony to a U.S. House committee, Duncan's team started destroying files on Oct. 23--six days after federal securities officials contacted Enron. 
They kept at it until about Nov. 9, one day after the feds subpoenaed Enron's Chicago-based auditor. 
Now a large part of the urgent quest to find out who at Enron and Andersen knew what, and when--and what they did about it--depends on the success of computer forensics experts who are poking into Andersen's electronic nooks and crannies. 
The effort is the latest high-stakes drama in a computer forensics industry that got its start in 1986 during the Iran-Contra controversy, Tribune computer columnist James Coates reminds us. Then, FBI investigators used back-up tapes of e-mail to reconstruct about 5,000 messages shredded electronically by a computer-savvy Oliver North. 
In Andersen's case, forensics experts not only will try to restore deleted files and e-mail--a relatively easy task unless Duncan's team used sophisticated shredder software to overwrite the files many times. 
They're also looking to document any changes Andersen's audit team made to files that weren't destroyed. 
To hear some computer experts tell it, the recovery task is a walk in a Windows park. 
Corporate e-document trails are simply too rich, and the documents too broadly distributed, to completely escape recovery. 
These experts say the chances that Duncan's team used shredding software are slim. ""Probably 1 percent of companies use file- shredding programs"" when disposing of documents, said Joan Feldman, founder and president of Seattle-based Computer Forensics Inc. 
Even when hard drives are wiped clean, Feldman says, digital data is recorded in myriad places: on back-up tapes in data centers, on laptops and digital assistants, even fax machines and telephone systems. 
Deleted e-mail is even easier to recover, these experts say. Even after being trashed from mailboxes, it lingers on file servers that are programmed to archive e-mail and keep it for weeks or months. 
""Maybe the lead players go through their own hard drives hammer and tong,"" Feldman says. ""But there might be a secretary who didn't get the word she was supposed to destroy things. A lot is left behind on file servers."" 
Still, the lawyers representing shareholders who lost billions in Enron's meltdown aren't nearly as optimistic. 
They note that months went by between when the files were deleted and when Andersen started its recovery process. 
Attorneys were allowed Wednesday to take a first-hand look at the initial stages of the data-recovery effort--a visit to a secure, 6- foot by 6-foot room in a downtown Chicago office building, stacked with computer gear collected from Andersen's local office. It's a room crammed with laptops, file servers, back-up tapes and more. 
All the gear will be shipped to Houston, where Andersen has a much larger collection area. The equipment will be scoured by a forensics firm that Andersen hired, ASR Data Acquisition & Analysis of Cedar Park, Texas. 
ASR's founder, Andrew Rosen, wouldn't comment Wednesday on his work for Andersen. 
But, like Feldman, he extolled the capabilities of his firm's high- tech retrieval tools. 
""It's like sending a man to the moon,"" Rosen said. ""It's difficult, expensive and challenging, but it's still doable."" 
Time will tell. 
One thing is certain: There's no high-tech magic that can restore the money lost by Enron's employees and its shareholders.

Enron's One Good Return: Political Investments
By Albert R. Hunt

01/31/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A19
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

By last summer Enron wanted out of its huge power plant in India. It was, as the World Bank predicted eight years earlier, a white elephant. Company chairman Kenneth Lay soon demanded more than $2 billion from the Indian government for the ill-fated project, warning the U.S. otherwise might impose sanctions. 
Vice President Cheney, on June 27, lobbied Indian opposition leader, Sonia Gandhi, on behalf of Enron, shortly after the Cheney energy task force specifically recommended promoting energy production India. What was Enron's role? Mr. Cheney won't say.
There are numerous unanswered questions about the way this discredited company wielded its considerable political influence. Another is the circumstances surrounding the hiring four years ago of Christian-right activist Ralph Reed to lobby utility regulators in Pennsylvania. Was this at the behest of the Bush presidential campaign, and were there other such political favors? 
There are some who, with a straight face, ask if Enron got anything for its political largesse -- $6 million in contributions, most of it in unregulated soft money. While we're at it, here are some other questions to puzzle over: Is Michael Jordan is good for the NBA? Is Helen Hunt a great actress? Is Madonna trashy? 
Few special interests got more access or results than Enron: legislative favors, a lax oversight of its risky financial derivatives, tax breaks, unsurpassed input into the Cheney energy legislation drafting process and most of what it wanted, and reportedly even veto authority over regulatory appointees. 
Enron's successes soured only when the company's fortunes turned south last October. It was, as Democrats James Carville and Paul Begala charge, ""like the hooker who fell out of love with the sailor after he ran out of money."" 
The Enron/India episode undercuts the administration's contention that it only followed its free-market principles. Treasury Secretary O'Neill approvingly noted that, ""The genius of capitalism is people make good or bad decisions and they get to pay the consequences or enjoy the fruits."" 
Enron failed in India and, under a controversial and contested contract, wanted to be bailed out. Irrespective of whether a failure to do so would have hurt foreign investment in India, was it the role of the American government to seek such a favor for a big campaign contributor? President Bush abandoned plans to bring up the issue on Nov. 9 with Prime Minister Vajpayee; by then Enron was collapsing. (Enron had spent $20 million ""educating"" the Indians on how capitalism works.) 
In drafting the energy initiatives, thanks to Rep. Henry Waxman, we now know that, as of last March 30, the State Department's recommendations didn't mention energy and India. But, in the ensuing weeks, while meeting with Mr. Lay and other Enron executives, the Cheney task force inserted a section pushing oil and gas production in India. 
A precondition, the Indians were told, was to take care of the Enron controversy first. Last July, this newspaper reported, Christina Rocca, assistant secretary of state, met with Indian officials on energy issues and told them ""many of India's problems in this regard can be summed up in the five-letter word, `Enron'."" 
This went well beyond simply drumming up business for an American company abroad. It would mean Enron didn't ""pay the consequences"" for ""bad decisions."" This wasn't principles and philosophy; it was politics and money. 
Also transparent is the vice president's contention that telling Congress who participated in drafting the energy measure would undermine the presidency. Congress's General Accounting Office, which yesterday announced it will sue the vice president, isn't seeking confidential internal correspondence or communications. All it wants are the names of the lobbyists and subjects they raised. If the White House would have sworn that this substantially impairs the operations of government it would have ended the matter. It didn't because this is about political embarrassment. (Yesterday the San Francisco Chronicle reported that last April Mr. Lay privately gave Mr. Cheney a memo enumerating eight positions favored by Enron, most of which made it into the administration's proposals.) 
The Ralph Reed story broke when the New York Times reported that in the fall of 1997 Enron, at the behest of Bush political adviser Karl Rove, put Mr. Reed on its payroll. It was a way, sources said, to take care of the politically valuable Mr. Reed. Both Mr. Reed and Enron deny this assertion, though neither will provide specifics on how much Mr. Reed was paid -- it was in the ""range"" of $10,000 to $20,000 a month, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer says -- or how long. 
Pennsylvania politicians find it curious that Mr. Reed would be enlisted in a state where he had little experience. On CNN Mr. Reed said he was lobbying for then-Gov. Tom Ridge's deregulation plan. But that passed in 1996, before he was hired, so he explained his role was to drum up support while the Public Utility Commission was ""drawing up regulations that implemented the law."" 
Mr. Reed was on the payroll -- there were one-sentence references to his Enron connection then in The Wall Street Journal and the Associated Press -- but for such a lucrative compensation, he didn't cut much of figure in those regulatory proceedings. ""I was totally unaware that Ralph Reed was involved in this issue,"" says John Hangar, a PUC member in 1997 and 1998. This all may have been partly legitimate, but it raises questions over Enron's coziness with the Bush crowd and whether there were other retainers. 
What money bought Enron was unsurpassed access and, in the case of Congress, the benefit of the doubt on arcane but critical issues that most lawmakers knew or cared little about. Everyone knew Enron was a big money contributor. 
Ultimately, this company played with funny money. But their political investment helped prolong the Ponzi scheme. In the last election cycle, Enron dished out $1.67 million in soft money to federal candidates; as the House GOP leadership desperately tries to halt the scandal-fueled momentum for a campaign finance reform that would ban soft money, it's offering an alternative. Under that proposal Enron could have given $1.28 million the last election. It only would have been 80% as corrupt. 
The president, in a highly praised State of the Union address, hit almost all of the right political erogenous zones except for Enron and campaign finance reform. The two are inextricably linked. Mr. Bush's stratospheric popularity notwithstanding, they're not going away.

THE NATION THE FALL OF ENRON Firm Accused of Withholding Data Probe: Senate panel chairman says the company has not produced some requested documents.

TIMES STAFF WRITERS

WASHINGTON -- Already under fire for shredding documents, Enron Corp. is now facing accusations that it failed to turn over records to congressional investigators looking into the company's collapse. 
Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), who chairs a subcommittee that will hear from former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay next week, is not satisfied that Enron released all the records that investigators are seeking, a source close to the probe said Wednesday.
The records relate to the controversial off-the-books partnerships that masked the company's financial problems. Among other things, the Senate Commerce Committee's subcommittee on consumer affairs is seeking a list of investors in those partnerships. 
The partnerships are a key focus of investigators piecing together the causes of Enron's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on Dec. 2, less than a month after it announced previously unreported losses of $586 million over nearly five years. 
Dorgan was unavailable for comment Wednesday, and an Enron attorney did not return a call for comment. 
Senate investigators are pushing Enron to turn over the partnership documents before Monday's hearing with Lay, who is appearing voluntarily and without a grant of immunity. 
Lay is likely to be grilled about why Enron failed so abruptly, costing investors and employees billions of dollars in stock and retirement fund losses. He resigned as chairman and chief executive Jan. 23. 
At least one congressional committee appears satisfied that Enron has provided all requested documents. 
Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), who chairs a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, said his investigators have not been stymied by Enron's resistance to turning over documents. 
But Greenwood lambasted Enron's continued shredding of internal documents until earlier this month, even after the company was aware of numerous government investigations. 
""What they have shredded is their credibility,"" Greenwood said. ""It's outrageous that while Enron was the subject of investigations by the Justice Department, the SEC and multiple committees of Congress, it would get anywhere near a shredder. They shouldn't shred so much as an old newspaper without carefully clearing it with investigators."" 
In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to say whether the firm had ceased all document destruction. 
""We have and will continue to comply with requests for information,"" said spokeswoman Karen Denne. ""We asked the Department of Justice to come in and investigate, and the FBI is currently conducting an investigation."" 
Stephen Cooper, the bankruptcy consultant selected this week as Enron's interim chief executive, said a special committee of the energy giant's board should complete an internal investigation in less than a week. 
Cooper participated in a conference call with reporters Wednesday along with former Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon, who was promoted this week to president. McMahon was one of several executives who complained about the firm's off-the-books partnerships, according to a memo written by Enron Vice President Sherron S. Watkins. 
McMahon declined to answer questions about his complaints, and Cooper said he was not focused on the causes of Enron's fall. 
""I'm not gonna spend my time here looking in the rearview mirror,"" he said. ""The fact of the matter is, there are a lot of people here who deserve our best shot at reorganizing this company, and the only way that's going to happen is if we look forward,"" he said. 
Some analysts say the remains of Enron are likely to be sold off in pieces in order to pay creditors. Cooper said that although Enron has sold its biggest revenue-generating divisions, the small pipelines and other remaining assets are ""very manageable, very steady businesses"" that may propel the firm enough so it can emerge from bankruptcy. 
aid the firm had about $10 billion in secured debt (debt guaranteed by the pledge of assets) and $30 billion in unsecured debt. 
Also Wednesday, congressional investigators indicated they would ask Enron officials for more information about a warning made in August to Lay and the company's board of directors about Enron's accounting irregularities. 
Margaret Ceconi, a former sales director at Enron Energy Services, alleged in an Aug. 29 e-mail that her division had hidden losses of more than $500 million. House Energy and Commerce Committee leaders wrote to Lay, asking, ""What happened to Ms. Ceconi's e-mail after you received it and how has Enron responded to it?""

Ernst & Young Says It Played Dual PNC Role
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Susan Pulliam, Carrick Mollenkamp, Paul Beckett and Scot Paltrow

01/31/2002
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Yet another Big Five firm is getting caught up in post-Enron accounting questions. 
Ernst & Young confirmed yesterday that it had played an unusual, dual role in the accounting problems that this week plagued PNC Financial Services Group, the Pittsburgh bank-holding company that on Tuesday said it would have to restate its financial results because of the way it accounted for three companies it set up with insurance company American International Group.
As PNC's auditor, Ernst & Young approved the transactions, which have since become the subject of a probe by the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Separately, however, Ernst & Young also acted as an ""accounting adviser"" to AIG as it drew up the plan for the vehicles that would later be called into question. Ernst & Young issued a letter that helped AIG pitch its product to banks. 
Ernst & Young spokesman Larry Parnell said the firm gave AIG a so-called SAS-50 letter, which is a formal statement attesting that such a transaction had been reviewed by senior Ernst & Young officials. 
Ernst & Young's roles highlight one of the most pressing controversies stemming from the Enron Corp. meltdown -- that of accounting firms providing both auditing and advising services to clients. Critics say such arrangements pose potential conflicts, and congressional investigators currently are looking into potentially banning the practice. 
Mr. Parnell says there wasn't any conflict of interest in the firm serving both as an adviser to AIG on the transactions, and then later approving them as PNC's outside auditor. ""If we felt there was a conflict, we wouldn't have done it,"" he said. 
Mr. Parnell said Ernst & Young signed off on the transactions because ""at the time we felt it was an appropriate transaction."" But he acknowledged that the federal inquiries ""have changed that perception,"" and said Ernst & Young ""concurred"" with the Fed's call for the accounting treatment to be reversed. 
Ernst & Young's role in the PNC accounting is likely to raise yet more questions about the way in which the nation's biggest accounting firms audit the books of public companies. 
In this case, the roles are particularly tricky given the role of Robert Herdman, a former vice chairman of Ernst & Young who was at the firm during the SAS-50 review. Mr. Herdman is now the SEC's chief accountant, and the SEC is reviewing the PNC transactions. 
Mr. Parnell said that although senior Ernst & Young officials participated in the review, Mr. Herdman wasn't among them. An SEC spokeswoman said Mr. Herdman, who became the SEC's chief accountant in October after leaving his position as vice chairman of Ernst & Young, ""has had no involvement either at Ernst & Young or at the Securities and Exchange Commission with any of those matters."" 
The accounting problem, which has caused PNC's stock to fall 10% this week, is causing Wall Street to take a closer look at financial mechanisms that allow banks to reduce the amount of debt they carry on their books. 
In addition, because of Arthur Andersen's dealings with Enron -- in which that firm acknowledged shredding documents relating to the energy firm -- investors are taking a ""shoot first and aim later,"" approach to any stock associated with accounting irregularities, says Michael Frinquelli, a partner at Renaissance Fund Advisors, a New York investment firm that specializes in insurance stocks. 
James Rohr, PNC chief executive, emphasized that the amount of loans put into the companies in question represented less than 1% of the bank's overall assets and was merely one way that the bank in recent years has been reducing its loan exposure. He said the three companies set up with AIG were the only time that the bank took that particular approach of disposing of loans. 
So far, it appears that PNC's financial maneuver was unique. Still, investors -- along with experienced Wall Street pros -- are getting an unfortunate lesson in just how banks can adjust their loan exposure with a few accounting moves. 
PNC said Tuesday that after a review of its numbers by the Federal Reserve, it was revising lower its net income for 2001 by $155 million. The news sent PNC's stock down 9.6%. Yesterday, PNC fell 37 cents to $55.71. 
According to people familiar with PNC's accounting moves, Ernst & Young worked closely with AIG from the inception on the financial structure that PNC began using last year. Ernst & Young served as an adviser to AIG on a model for the PNC transactions, which was developed in early 2001. 
Though PNC's transactions weren't completed until the fourth quarter of 2001, AIG had put together a blueprint for such a structure that it used as tool to shop the idea to other banks, the person said. 
AIG requested a special opinions, or SAS-50, from Ernst & Young. Ernst & Young wrote three letters to AIG concerning the transaction, including the SAS-50. The letters were dated in April, May and November and gave Ernst & Young's opinion on various iterations of the structure with the final being used as a model to pitch other banks on the idea.

Law firm cuts ties with Enron, citing potential conflict

01/31/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - A large law firm has severed all ties with Enron Corp., citing potential conflict of interest with the financially troubled company, the Houston Chronicle reported in its Thursday editions. 
The firm's politically connected lawyers - who include Republican National Committee Chairman Marc Racicot and Texas Republican attorney general candidate Greg Abbott - have faced criticism that their relationships with a law firm working for Enron could pose conflicts.
Patrick Oxford, managing partner of Bracewell & Patterson, said the firm made its decision when the energy trading company asked for protection under U.S. bankruptcy laws on Dec. 2. 
""We do represent some of the larger creditors of Enron. So some potential for conflict was there,"" Oxford said Wednesday. 
Oxford said Bracewell is among Enron's creditors, owed approximately $300,000. 
For a short time after Enron went into bankruptcy proceedings, Oxford said, Bracewell represented a subsidiary company, Enron Wind. That tie also has been cut, he said. 
Abbott has returned $12,600 he received from Enron in contributions to his campaigns for state Supreme Court. He resigned from the court last year to set the stage for his attorney general's race, and joined Bracewell & Patterson. 
A leading consumer advocate, Public Citizen Texas director Tom ""Smitty"" Smith, criticized Abbott this week, saying that as attorney general Abbott might face a conflict because Bracewell and the state of Texas both are Enron creditors. The state lost an estimated $68.5 million from Enron's collapse, much of it in employee retirement funds that contained Enron stock. 
Robert Black, a spokesman for Abbott's campaign, denied there was any conflict. 
President Bush's selection of Racicot, former Montana governor, as the national Republican chairman, came under fire. Racicot dropped Enron as a lobby client, but declined to resign as a Bracewell lawyer. 
Vinson & Elkins, Houston's largest law firm and Texas' most profitable, was earlier accused of violating ethical standards in its representation of Enron.

Bankruptcies
Enron hopes to rehire Vinson & Elkins
by Douglas McCollam

Copyright (c) 2002 The Deal LLC

The Houston law firm is seeking court approval to advise Enron in six areas, including litigation begun before the bankruptcy filing and the sale of overseas assets. 
Houston's Vinson & Elkins llp, the law firm under scrutiny for its work setting up Enron Corp.'s controversial partnerships and, later, investigating allegations of improper accounting, seeks court approval to remain one of the main law firms for the bankrupt energy company.
In a filing late last week, V&E applied to U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, to be designated special counsel to Enron. The firm would advise Enron in six areas, including litigation begun before the bankruptcy filing and the sale of overseas assets. V&E would charge up to $665 dollars an hour for its lawyers. 
The firm is among Enron's biggest creditors, the application shows, with $8.6 million in fees outstanding from before the bankruptcy. The firm estimates it did $6.5 million of work connected to the bankruptcy before it was filed, though New York's Weil, Gotshal & Manges llp is Enron's bankruptcy counsel. 
Under the bankruptcy code, a debtor can retain special counsel if it's ""in the best interest of the estate,"" provided the firm is not found to ""represent or hold any interest adverse to the debtor"" in matters on which it would advise. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom llp has also acted as special counsel since December, advising on asset sales and other corporate and finance issues. 
Enron said in a court document that, to its knowledge, V&E has no interest adverse to the company or its creditors that would prevent it from being hired. 
But an affidavit submitted by V&E's managing partner, Joseph C. Dilg, suggests some potential conflicts. For instance, V&E represents several Enron affiliates that have not filed bankruptcy, and some of those could bring claims against the company. Dilg's affidavit says V&E will not represent those affiliates in claims against Enron. 
V&E has also represented at least 15 former and existing Enron officers and directors personally, including former chairman Kenneth L. Lay; former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling; and current general counsel and former V&E partner James V. Derrick. Dilg's affidavit also states that, in addition to Derrick, four other former V&E lawyers are Enron officers. Neither the application nor Dilg's affidavit addresses potential conflicts between V&E, on the one hand, and Enron and its auditor, Andersen. 
V&E gave advice on partnership transactions and later disclosures about them that Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice are investigating. V&E has hired John Villa of Washington's Williams & Connolly, a leading malpractice defense lawyer, to advise it on these issues. 
Harry Reasoner, former managing partner for V&E, said the firm applied to serve as special counsel at the urging of Enron and Weil, Gotshal. 
""A lot of things were still very active when the petition was filed and we've continued to work on those,"" Reasoner said. He said the millions Enron owes the firm is not relevant to its serving as special counsel. ""We'll just be like any other general creditor,"" he said. 
Reasoner could not say what portion of the $8.6 million due to the firm is owed by Enron's non-debtor affiliates, nor which of those affiliates may bring claims against Enron. 
Weil, Gotshal partner Martin J. Bienenstock, Enron's lead lawyer in the bankruptcy, said using V&E is simply a matter of efficiency. ""They'll just work on matters they were previously involved with,"" Bienenstock said. 
Bienenstock said that creditors were told Enron wants to keep using V&E but have not indicated how they would respond. The court should take up the application in the next week or so, Bienenstock said. 
An attorney for one of Enron's principal creditors said his client probably would not object to the use of V&E. 
""They have a lot of institutional knowledge. If it makes things go smoother to use them, that's better for us,"" he said. Potential problems between V&E and Enron would be put aside for the time being, he added. ""It's still early. Everyone wants to get along for now."" 
Conor Reilly, a bankruptcy partner with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher llp, says the spotlight puts V&E in an unusual position. ""Obviously, it's normal for debtor's counsel to have worked for the debtor prior to filing bankruptcy, but this situation is very tricky,"" Reilly said. ""I can't recall anything comparable.""

UK press watchdog chief Lord Wakeham steps down amid Enron links

01/31/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

LONDON (AFX) - The collapse of US energy giant Enron Corp has caused further ripples in the UK, with the head of the country's press watchdog stepping down ""temporarily"". 
Lord Wakeham has departed pending a probe into his links with the failed company.
The chairman of the Press Complaints Commission - which keeps close tags on media standards and intrusion into privacy - said the publicity generated by an investigation into his ties with Enron could harm the watchdog. 
""As chairman of the Press Complaints Commission for the past seven years, I am only too aware of the damage that can be done to individuals and institutions that are thrust into the public spotlight,"" he said in a statement. 
Wakeham was previously energy secretary under former prime minister Margaret Thatcher and a non-executive director at Enron. 
He now faces questioning from a US congressional inquiry. 
""Since the collapse of Enron, I have been unable to make any statement or undertake any interviews on the subject for legal reasons,"" Wakeham said. 
He added that he saw it as ""a matter of honour to stand aside temporarily from the chairmanship of the commission"" until the probe is completed.

Enron board member temporarily resigns press watchdog job

01/31/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

LONDON (AP) - John Wakeham, a prominent Conservative politician whose seat on the board of the disgraced Enron Corp. has made him the center of speculation about the corporate scandal's British links, temporarily stepped aside Thursday from his job as head of a press watchdog group. 
Wakeham oversaw the privatization of Britain's electricity industry as energy minister in Margaret Thatcher's government and approved Enron's bid for permission to build one of the first gas-fired electric generating plants in Britain.
He later joined the company's board as a non-executive director and could be asked to testify at U.S. Congressional hearings about its collapse. 
Wakeham said in a statement that he wanted to protect the Press Complaints Commission - an industry body that hears complaints about news coverage - from any hint of scandal. 
""I am only too aware of the damage that can be done to individuals and institutions that are thrust into the public spotlight,"" he said. ""I therefore see it as a matter of honor to stand aside temporarily from the chairmanship of the commission until the report of the Independent Investigating Committee of Enron is published and evaluated."" 
He said he had been unable to speak publicly about Enron for legal reasons, a position he said was incompatible with his chairmanship of the commission. 
Wakeham, a widely respected senior figure chosen by Prime Minister Tony Blair to head a commission studying reform of the House of Lords, is the most prominent British politician to be significantly touched so far by the Enron mess. 
A well-connected senior Conservative, he was regarded as one of the most adept ministers in Thatcher's government. 
In his politically sensitive post at the Press Complaints Commission, he has dealt with complaints from people aggrieved by newspapers, including Blair and the royal family. 
Enron's collapse also has put pressure on Blair's government to explain how the company won favorable government decisions after giving financial support to the Labor Party. Questions also are being raised about Labor's relationship with Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditors.

Questioning the Books: CPA Institute's President Opposes More Limits on Nonaudit Services
By Steve Liesman
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

01/31/2002
The Wall Street Journal
A8
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

As investigations continue into the collapse of Enron Corp., the head of the country's leading public accountants' group says he opposes additional limits on work that auditors can do for their clients. 
""If we had outright prohibition on the scope of services [auditors could perform for clients] the likelihood of Enron occurring would be just the same,"" Barry Melancon, president of the American Institute for Certified Public Accountants, said in an interview. ""It wouldn't prevent Enron.""
Democratic Sens. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Jon Corzine of New Jersey have said they will propose legislation to sharply limit nonaudit services that auditors can perform. 
The legislation to be introduced next week would prohibit an auditor from performing bookkeeping or other services related to a client's accounting records as well as appraisal or valuation services and fairness opinions. ""Just as you wouldn't want the builder of your house to also be the building inspector, we need to build a better financial `firewall' to protect investors from conflicts of interest,"" Sen. Dodd said in a statement last week when announcing his proposed legislation. 
At a press conference scheduled for today, New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall is expected to call on the Securities and Exchange Commission to prohibit auditors from providing nonaudit services to clients. 
Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditors, booked $27 million in nonaudit services for the company in 2000, compared with $25 million in auditing fees. 
Mr. Melancon said that limiting the scope of services actually could increase the chances of audit failure. He said consulting work gives auditors intimate knowledge of a company that can help in auditing and helps accounting firms attract better candidates with the promise of work that extends beyond auditing. Mr. Melancon also said an accounting firm that relies solely on the auditing fees might be less likely to raise questions about a company's finances than an accounting firm performing a variety of services. ""It's not a question of independence. It's a question of dependence,"" he said. ""If I have only an audit, am I more or less inclined to apply judgment?"" 
Mr. Melancon's views differ from those expressed by some lawmakers who believe a reason for Enron's failure was that client and the auditor became too close. Internal Enron documents have suggested Arthur Andersen knew about of the off-the-books partnerships that ultimately led to Enron's collapse, raising questions about why the accounting firm didn't put an end to the system that kept billions of dollars of debt off Enron's books. The SEC last year adopted tougher auditor-independence rules, which added a ban on appraisal or valuation services when accountants would be likely to audit the results of such work. Mr. Melancon said more time is needed to see if those rules are adequate. Critics complained that the rules adopted last year were too lax, allowing, for example, auditors to perform 40% of a corporate client's internal auditing work. 
In a speech last week, SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt didn't mention the question of auditors' potential conflicts of interest as among the systemic problems exposed by Enron's collapse. Rather, Mr. Pitt has called for greater public participation in auditor oversight. 
Mr. Pitt has proposed a new oversight board to be dominated by ""public membership"" that has the power to investigate and discipline the industry.

Mr. Melancon backed the chairman's proposal.

The Gottesdiener Law Firm Moves Against Enron in Bankruptcy Court

01/31/2002
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2002, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 31, 2002-- 

Firm Seeks to Establish Company's $1 Billion Liability to Workers and Block Enron's Efforts to Use Insurance Money Earmarked From Workers to Pay for Top Enron
Executives' Legal Defense 

The Gottesdiener Law Firm announced today that it moved against Enron Corporation in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, asking the Court to lift the ""automatic stay"" that has protected the company from suit since it filed for bankruptcy on December 2, 2001. 
The legal maneuver would allow workers to proceed in their efforts to establish that the company violated federal pension laws in its handling of its 401(k) Plan, and share in whatever proceeds may be available after secured creditors' claims are satisfied in the bankruptcy. 
According to Eli Gottesdiener, the head of the Washington, D.C. 401(k) and pension class action law firm, which sued Enron, Arthur Andersen and others in November 2001, the Enron 401(k) Plan, including a $1 billion claim against the Company, ""is perhaps Enron's largest single creditor, and its participants are the principal victims of the company's devastating collapse."" 
""No interest in the bankruptcy should be superior to that of Enron's workers, and giving them the ability to promptly litigate their claims against the company should be a top priority for our justice system - if not that of Enron itself,"" Gottesdiener said. 
Gottesdiener called on the company to ""let its employees and ex-employees have their day in court"" and establish that, as his suit on behalf of workers alleges, the company breached its federal fiduciary duties in loading employees up with artificially inflated Enron stock. Gottesdiener said he had ""every intention of making sure Enron workers sit at the head of the unsecured creditors' table in the bankruptcy."" 
Separately, the firm also moved today to block Enron from tapping into an $85 million fiduciary liability insurance policy earmarked to compensate workers. This move follows statements by the company suggesting an intent to use the policy proceeds to fund the legal defense of key company executives caught up in the various Congressional and Executive Branch probes of its actions. 
Gottesdiener called the company's action ""disappointing"" and another example of ""Enron overreaching."" 
The papers the firm filed with the bankruptcy court are available at on the Website dedicated to the 401(k) litigation, www.enronsuit.com.

Law Firm Asks Court To Lift Enron 'Automatic Stay'

01/31/2002

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A law firm has asked the court overseeing Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) bankruptcy to lift the ""automatic stay"" provision that protects the company from workers seeking $1 billion compensation for their pension plans. 
The Gottesdiener law firm, based in Washington, filed suit against Enron in November, after company admissions of accounting irregularities and a precipitous drop in company stock.
The lawsuit alleged that Enron violated federal pension laws ""by selling employees Enron stock knowing the price was artificially inflated, and by locking employees into Enron stock because of an administrative change to the company 401(k) plan."" Gottesdiener later named accounting firm Arthur Andersen LLP as an additional defendant. 
But when Enron filed for bankruptcy in December, the Chapter 11 code protected it from employee pension claims. 
In a press release Thursday, Gottesdiener said having the automatic stay provision lifted would allow the workers' pension case to proceed.

4 BofA execs quit in wake of Enron's fall
Christian Berthelsen
Chronicle Staff Writer

FINAL
B.1
(Copyright 2002)

Three Bank of America executives who were managing the bank's business with Enron Corp. have resigned their jobs during the past week, and a fourth said yesterday he will resign and leave the bank soon. 
The departures come in the wake of $231 million in losses Bank of America reported during the fourth quarter as a result of its exposure to Enron, the energy-trading giant that collapsed late last year amid a loss of investor confidence brought on by revelations of secret partnerships that hid debt.
Jo Tamalis and James Allred of Houston, along with Marcia Bateman of Dallas, left their jobs at the end of last week, a bank spokeswoman confirmed. The bank said Steve Bragg of New York, a fourth executive associated with the Enron account, will leave in the coming weeks to ""pursue other opportunities."" 
About $210 million of BofA fourth-quarter losses came from loan charge-offs, and $21 million came from a write-down of what the bank called ""securities related to a collateralized loan obligation."" 
Eloise Hale, another spokeswoman, said most of the losses were unsecured. She declined to specify the precise structure of BofA's lending relationship with Enron or to elaborate beyond statements the bank has already made about its losses. 
BofA said it has $272 million in further exposure to Enron, including a $46 million untapped line of credit. Of the remaining exposure, $42 million is unsecured. 
Tamalis was a client manager in Bank of America's natural resources group, which handles creditors in the energy and power sector. Bragg, the head of that group, is expected to leave the bank in the coming weeks. 
Bateman and Allred were credit products officers, charged with managing risk exposure for the bank. 
Bank of America confirmed that all four executives were connected to its Enron account, but declined to specify the terms of their departures or to say whether they were related to the Enron collapse. 
Tamalis and Allred did not return calls to their homes in Houston. Bateman and Bragg could not be reached.

Former Texas governor: `stunned' by Enron collapse

01/31/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

DALLAS (AP) - Former Texas Gov. Ann Richards says the government should do all it can for the former Enron Corp. employees who lost their life savings with the company's collapse, but said recent revelations are so different from what she remembers of Enron and its ex-CEO, Ken Lay. 
Richards, now a lobbyist in New York City, spoke about Enron and other topics during an hour-long appearance with CNN's Larry King on Wednesday night.
""I'm going to tell you, I was so shocked, so stunned. What we've been hearing does not describe the Ken Lay I knew. He was mister public spirited, mister community, mister what can I do to help the Boy Scouts, mister how can I help the arts center,"" Richards said. 
She said Enron gave $12 million last year to charities and the art community. 
""There was never a more public-spirited organization, and its leadership was always there to help you,"" she said. ""... He was standup guy. He did everything he could for his community."" 
She gives high marks to President George W. Bush for his leadership since the terrorists' Sept. 11 attacks and praised speechwriters for the state of the nation speech on Tuesday. But she criticized what Bush has said about Enron and about Lay. 
Bush has said that Lay supported Richards instead of him when he unseated her as Texas governor in 1994. 
""Wasn't that silly of George Bush saying, `Oh, the only reason I kept him (Lay) was for continuity, because of Governor Richards.' Why didn't he just say, `Well, you know, these people are good friends of mine, they've given me a lot of money and I'm grateful to them, and I feel terrible about this. I feel terrible for them and I feel terrible for Houston.' 
""Instead of saying it was because he supported Ann Richards. Here's exactly what happened. Ken called me and said, `Ann, I'm going to tell you, we are very, very close to the Bush family.' And he said, `My wife is going to be in this race for George W., money, marble and chalk.' He said, `I think you've done a good job, and I'm probably going to vote for you, and I'm going to give you a little bit of money.' "" 
Richards recalled published reports that she received about $12,000. 
""And, of course, it turns out that he gave George W. a whole bunch more than that - three or four times that - but that is inconsequential,"" she said. ""Even though we are heartsick and angry that this company has put all these people out of work, and some of us certainly lost money, but still, if someone did something good, you have to stand up and say that person at that time was my friend, and not pretend that he doesn't know them."" 
On the Enron financial meltdown, Richards said, ""I don't have a clue what happened. But they were doing some incredibly energetic accounting, and they had Arthur Andersen standing there telling them they could do it and that they had attorneys that they were asking their opinion of, and the attorneys were telling them they could do it."" 
When the house of cards started to collapse, she said, ""then you have a run, and everybody is going to sell their stock or try their best to get out of there. And I think that's exactly what brought that company down,"" Richards said. 
""The sad part is what it's done for so many investors. And those poor people, 4,200 people are out of work in Houston,"" she said. 
King asked her if the government owes the former Enron employees anything other than unemployment checks. 
""I think the government certainly ought to examine if they can extend unemployment benefits, whether there are any extraordinary measures that they can help them for a period of times until they can get new jobs,"" she said. 
""Because this isn't an easy time. This economy is tough. People all across the country are looking for jobs, and to have 4,200 people suddenly laid off at Enron in the middle of this recession makes it even tougher.""

Stock dumped on Enron jitters
Jon Ogden

South China Morning Post

Asian investors dumped stocks yesterday as fallout from the Enron bankruptcy triggered a crisis of confidence in United States accounting standards. 
Fresh instances of shady accounting practices coming to light could lead to a fundamental revaluation of overpriced US stocks and cast a shadow over financial markets for weeks or months, investment professionals warned.
Phillip Securities research director Louis Wong Wai-kit said: ""It seems they have opened a can of worms after the Enron bankruptcy. It causes jitters . . . and there is a spillover to regional markets."" The Hang Seng Index fell 257.28 points, or 2.33 per cent, to 10,756.96 points, South Korean stocks plunged 3.17 per cent while Japan's Nikkei 225 broke through 10,000 points, falling 1.06 per cent to 9,919.48. 
Conglomerate Tyco International fell 19.88 per cent, losing US$16 billion in market capital, on rumours about its accounting of acquisitions and fears it was holding too much short-term debt. 
""We are getting all sorts of skeletons coming out of the closet,"" JF Funds senior global funds manager David Atkinson said. ""It is clear there is quite a lot of manipulation [of earnings] going on."" 
Rumours were rife on Wall Street that regulators were out examining corporate balance sheets which could lead to companies having to make confessions when they reported this quarter's earnings, Mr Atkinson said. 
US energy firm Williams lost 22 per cent, to US$18.78, after saying it would delay an earnings report. Diversified Cendant, owner of Avis rental cars, lost 9.97 per cent with worries about its seven off-balance-sheet funding entities, which resemble Enron's. 
BNP Paribas Peregrine Asia strategist Raymond Foo said: ""Essentially, you have investors for the first time questioning the reliability of [US] earnings. 
""A huge part of the premium in valuations in the US is premised on the fact that it is transparent and a very open system. The moment investors question that would lead to a downgrading of the valuations."" 
US corporate profits to the end of 2000 had fallen to the level of those booked in 1997. But the profits of companies in the S&P 500 benchmark at the end of 2000 were 35 per cent above their level in 1997. That gap looked suspicious, said Chris Carter, strategist for Investec Asset Management. 
""I am sure we are going to be faced with more cases of outright fraud, though I doubt it will be on scale of Enron,"" Mr Carter said. ""There is a good chance that a higher risk premium will be built into US assets."" 
That might have implications for a weaker dollar and the financing of the giant US current account deficit. 
The S&P 500 index was trading on a lofty 23 times trailing operating earnings or 45 times if write-offs were included, Mr Carter said. 
Yet ever-positive Wall Street analysts still have not woken up. Goldman Sachs strategist Abby Joseph Cohen last week dropped her earnings expectations for S&P 500 companies by 19.23 per cent, yet declined to reduce her target for the index, a decision Mr Carter described as ""astonishing"". 
The Asian financial crisis had caused most corporate skeletons to come out of the closet in the region, Mr Foo said. While Asia might take a hit in line with the US on the accounting issue in the short term, in the longer term it should out-perform the US. 
""At least you know where the minefields [in Asia] are,"" he said. ""You know which countries and companies have good corporate governance and which do not."" 
However, Mr Carter thought it unlikely Asia could decouple from the US. ""The stock market continues to be the driver of the US economy. If the stock market falls that will impact on consumer activity, which in turn will impact on Asia."" 
The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of the US Congress, intends to take the White House to court to obtain details of how a task force headed by Vice-President Dick Cheney formulated its energy plan, congressional sources said yesterday. Among the details sought by the office are the task force's contacts with energy companies, including Enron.

ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: A CASE STUDY
A Video Study Of Enron Offers A Picture of Life Before the Fall
By SHAILA K. DEWAN

01/31/2002
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2002 New York Times Company

HOUSTON, Jan. 30 -- In April 2000, Enron was still flying high, at least publicly. Jeffrey K. Skilling, the president and chief operating officer at the time, faced a video camera and spoke enthusiastically about the corporate culture that would, he insisted, enable Enron to go from the world's largest energy-trading company to the world's leading company, period. 
''People have an obligation to dissent in this company,'' Mr. Skilling said, detailing Enron's core values of respect, communication, excellence and integrity as company posters of a sunflower and a smiling baby girl flashed on the screen of what became a multimedia computer presentation. ''I mean, I sit up here on the 50th floor, in the library. I have no idea what's going on down there, so if you've got a problem with it, speak up. And if you don't speak up, that's not good.''
The video was part of what was supposed to be and, for a few months, was a case study of a phenomenal transformation, prepared by two University of Virginia business professors with exclusive access to Enron's top executives. But what was meant to inspire students has become a cautionary tale, a study in hubris all the more valuable for its intimate picture of life before the fall. 
The professors, Robert F. Bruner and Samuel E. Bodily, who teach at the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration, first saw Mr. Skilling in November 1999, when he spoke at the school. What they saw then was someone, they said, who might be the next John F. Welch, leading a company whose story could be told alongside those of the other giants like Mr. Welch's General Electric, or Home Depot or Wal-Mart Stores. 
What they see now is a business plan that reality refused to endorse. Even when they shot their first interviews -- the bulk of their 15 hours of film -- in May 2000 the company was already buying time, the professors say now. 
''All of the partnerships are there to hide the debt and make it possible to keep going,'' Dr. Bodily said in a phone interview this week. ''The strategy seemed to be, 'I lost money in the poker game, so now I'll take the mortgage down to the casino and gamble even harder,' '' he said. '' 'By tomorrow, I won't have to tell them anything.' '' 
But before the company began collapsing, Mr. Skilling came across as a bright, charismatic innovator who talked for three and a half hours, refusing to take a break. ''He would speak in sentences, the sentences would form paragraphs, the paragraphs were almost like chapters of a book,'' said Dr. Bruner, now very curious to see what the investigations of Enron will reveal about Mr. Skilling's behavior. ''Very smooth. Very, very smooth. I look back on some of that and say, 'You were not doing what you said you were doing.' '' 
A second round of filming occurred in May 2001, when Mr. Skilling, who by that time had become chief executive, told them, ''I think we'll be around for a long time.'' 
Amid platitudes (''People don't come to work for a company. They come to work for a mission.'') and back-slapping (''Ken is one of the nicest, most thoughtful human beings in the world.''), the executives describe how, under the leadership of Kenneth L. Lay, the company began to sell not just a product, but productive capacity, and apply that model to new markets like broadband. 
They also emphasized the importance of a progressive environment. ''We're going to do the right thing, and make money without having to do anything but the right thing,'' said Andrew S. Fastow, who has since been fired for his role in establishing partnerships that are now under investigation. 
The new, deregulated market for energy gave Mr. Skilling license to introduce a new corporate culture, the professors say, with high rewards for creativity as well as more ruthless practices like ''rank and yank,'' in which the company fired the least productive employees. 
In the case study, Mr. Skilling describes the company's search for a new rubric after it outgrew ''the world's leading energy company.'' He said, ''The voted favorite was 'world's coolest company.' '' 
The CD-ROM was first distributed last May. One morning in November, Dr. Bodily turned on his computer to find that the company had shut down its online trading operation. ''The company was gone,'' he said. 
So the partners added two sections to the case study; the original version, Dr. Bodily said, has already been auctioned on eBay for $197.50. One new section is called ''2001: The Fall of Enron.'' Its table of contents is essentially a chart of the stock's plunge marked with events like Mr. Skilling's abrupt resignation in August. The second sections is called ''Reflections.'' 
The study attracts keen interest in the classroom, but owning the rights to such a close look at the country's largest bankruptcy filing is not necessarily cause for glee. ''When you see a really successful company die so dramatically,'' Dr. Bruner said, ''you not only grieve for the loss of this exemplar, but also for the possible conclusions that students, current and former, might make.'' 
Yet neither professor is willing to dismiss the importance of the company's ideas, which ultimately made life easier and cheaper for its customers. ''That's part of the sadness that observers feel today,'' Dr. Bruner said. ''This company did get something right for a period of time there at least. It will be, I think, proved to be an innovation of significance to the American economy equal in significance to the PC.'' 
Luckily, failure can be as instructive as glory. Part of Dr. Bruner's Web site is devoted to his hobby, scripophily, the collecting of securities from companies, and even governments, of yore, many of which tell their own stories of financial folly. 
It is not hard to guess the latest addition to the display of antique scrip on his office wall: a framed certificate of 10 shares of Enron stock. Yesterday it was worth $4.05.

Learning From Enron

FINAL

Has anyone had the courage to ask Enron employees why they dumped everything they had into company stock when there were other choices inside their 401(k) plan? I'm not defending Enron's bookkeeping, but some perspective is in order. Enron employees weren't the first investors to see their dreams go up in smoke when company books were being cooked. Employee shareholders of McKesson, Sunbeam and Cendant -- to name a few -- have all felt Wall Street's wrath when their companies' accounting methods came under fire. 
Many Enron employee shareholders were just as greedy as their bosses. They made a fortune when Enron's stock price skyrocketed, and they lost it all when the company imploded. If they didn't have the common sense to diversify, I have difficulty feeling sorry for them.
Already members of Congress are hinting of legislation to limit how much money can be invested in company stock. Instead of being the poster child for more government meddling, perhaps the Enron episode can serve a better purpose. Maybe future investors will realize that having the bulk of their net worth tied to any single security -- stock or bond -- is dangerous. 
SCOTT W. FISHER 
Lower Burrell, Pa. 
* 
The most important issue stemming from the Enron mess shouldn't be one of confidentiality or possible wrongdoing on that corporation's behalf. It should be about how we are going to create public policy in this country. 
Why does the vice president need confidentiality here? What are these energy executives saying in ""private"" that they are unwilling to say in public? A public policy proposal emerged from these discussions -- one that could dramatically affect the environment, national security, the economy, etc. 
If the energy executives and experts are advising one thing in private and another in public, then the policy that emerged from the private discussions with the vice president and his commission is a policy based on a lie. 
If the advice given is the same in private as in public, where is the need for ""confidentiality""? 
The public deserves to know how the vice president's commission reached its recommendations, especially when so many people -- environmentalists, alternative-energy advocates, those who could not make political contributions like Enron -- were left out of the equation. 
This is not how you make good public policy. All it does is breed distrust of government. The vice president should turn over the documents and defend the policy based on its merit -- if it has any.

You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the Phantom Stock Account.  

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90% of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom Stock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. shares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distribution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for the Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Corp. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond section 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3		Plan Administrators		Section 7.1

Number of shares		6,600	shares		6,600	shares			6,600 shares
Relative share price		$27.23							$83.13
Phantom Stock Value		$179,718						$548,658
10% Penalty			-17,972			 -600				-54,866
Value to be distributed		$161,746		6,000 shares			$493,792
Current stock price									$10
Distribution			$161,746		6,000 shares			49,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout.   

In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matter.

Sincerely,


Phillip Allen

"Christmas Card Signing Party","Tom,

Michael Salinas is planning the Christmas Card Signing Party.  It looks like it's going to be at Cabo's THIS MONDAY, December 3rd at 5:00.  

I assume that we will be splitting the cost, but I guess I really shouldn't assume because of everything the company is going through right now.  Michael estimates the total cost to be $1000, making your half $500.  Let me know what you think.

Also, are there any customers (for the trading side) that we need to be sure are included to receive Christmas cards?  

Thanks,
Laura

Enron Discusses Credit Line of $1 Billion to $2 Billion With Banks
By Jathon Sapsford and John Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp., scrambling to restore confidence in its finances, is negotiating with banks for a new credit line of between $1 billion and $2 billion, and is likely to close a deal within days, according to officials familiar with the matter. 
The new credit line is intended to bolster Enron's financial condition and head off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence. The new credit would supplement existing lines, which are largely tapped out after Enron last week drew down about $3 billion to increase cash reserves and calm fears in the stock, bond and energy markets.
An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line, but said he couldn't supply any further details. 
Houston-based Enron is the nation's biggest energy trader and a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Once a favorite of Wall Street, the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convincing a deeply concerned investment community that, despite difficulties, its finances remain sound. 
Confidence in Enron's financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier this month announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 billion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then-chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
Last week, Enron replaced Mr. Fastow and said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions. The company has consistently said that the transactions were proper and legal. 
Enron's stock price fell again Friday. As of 4 p.m., in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down 95 cents at $15.40. Enron shares have fallen 50% in the past two weeks and are down 83% from a Sept. 18, 2000, high of $89.63. 
Late last week, Enron tapped its existing credit lines, with part of that money being used to redeem nearly $2 billion of its outstanding commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs. Ron Barone of credit-rating agency Standard & Poor's said he believes that Enron was ""getting a bit more resistance"" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due. Thus, Enron probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstanding, he said. 
The Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and still leaving the company with an additional roughly $1 billion cash on hand would give it more financial flexibility. 
Also last week, credit-rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing Enron's debt and commercial-paper ratings for a possible downgrade. A lower rating could hamper Enron's core trading businesses. 
Behind the worries among these agencies, in part, is the loss of investor confidence, which one of the rating companies, Fitch, said in a report last week could impair ""Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital markets, therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business."" 
The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company's trading partners are doing business with Enron on ""essentially the same terms"" as they have in the past. ""There has been no significant change in the credit conditions,"" he said. Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant's finances. 
The banks involved in the current negotiations, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the new credit line than they had asked for in the past, one official said. 
Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments. ""Confidence in this company was lost,"" said one bank official involved in the negotiations for a new credit line. ""But confidence will be restored."" 
Corporations of Enron's size commonly establish credit lines only to demonstrate to the investment community that in case of an emergency, they have access to cash. In practice, few companies actually make use of these lines. Thus, drawing down credit lines, while providing immediate cash, also illustrates the pressure Enron is feeling.

Manager's Journal: How Enron Ran Out of Gas
By Paul Kedrosky

10/29/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A22
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Is troubled Enron Corp. the Long Term Capital Management of the energy markets, or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too many of their own press releases? Or is poor Enron just misunderstood? Those are the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial releases from the beleaguered Houston-based energy concern. 
A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot. While tech stocks were tanking, Enron's shares gained 89% during 2000. Even die-hard Enron skeptics -- of which there are many -- had to concede that last year was a barnburner for the company. Earnings were up 25%, and revenues more than doubled.
Not bad, considering where the company came from. A decade ago 80% of Enron's revenues came from the staid (and regulated) gas-pipeline business. No longer. Enron has been selling those assets steadily, partly fuelling revenues, but also expanding into new areas. By 2000, around 95% of its revenues and more than 80% of its profits came from trading energy, and buying and selling stakes in energy producers. 
The stock market applauded the move: At its peak, Enron was trading at around 55 times earnings. That's more like Cisco's once tropospheric valuation than the meager 2.5 times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke Energy. 
But Enron management wanted more. It was, after all, a ""new economy"" Web-based energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded. According to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay, the company deserved to be valued accordingly. At a conference early this year he told investors the company's stock should be trading much higher -- say $126, more than double its price then. 
Then the new economy motor stalled. The company's president left under strange circumstances. And rumors swirled about Enron's machinations in California's energy markets. Investors pored over Enron's weakening financial statements. But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic scholars to penetrate the company's cryptic financials. In effect, Enron's troubles were hiding in plain sight. 
It should have been a warning. Because of the poor financial disclosure there was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company, or how it was trying to make its numbers. Most analysts blithely concede that they really didn't know how Enron made money -- in good markets or bad. 
Not that Enron didn't make money, it did -- albeit with a worrisomely low return on equity given the capital required -- but sometimes revenues came from asset sales and complex off-balance sheet transactions, sometimes from energy-trading revenues. And it was very difficult to understand why or how -- or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter. 
Enron's financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff. Deep inside the company filings was mention of LJM Cayman, L.P., a private investment partnership. According to Enron's March 2000 10-K, a ""senior officer of Enron is the managing member"" of LJM. Well, that was a puzzler. LJM was helping Enron ""manage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar assets by entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars."" It was, in a phrase, Enron's house hedge fund. 
There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market -- it is crucial for a market-maker. But having an Enron executive managing and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether, especially when the Enron executive was the company's CFO, Andrew Fastow. While he severed his connection with LJM (and related partnerships) in July of this year -- and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week -- the damage had been done. 
As stories in this paper have since made clear, Mr. Fastow's LJM partnership allegedly made millions from the conflict-ridden, board-approved LJM-Enron relationship. And recently Enron ended the merry affair, taking a billion-dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJM's wrong-footed hedging. Analysts, investors, and the Securities & Exchange Commission were left with many questions, and very few answers. 
To be fair, I suppose, Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a year ago, saying it had erected a Chinese wall between Fastow/LJM and the company. And in a bull market, no one paid much attention to what a bad idea that horribly conflicted relationship was -- or questioned the strength of the wall. Now it matters, as do other Enron-hedged financings, a number of which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003. 
We didn't do anything wrong is Mr. Lay's refrain in the company's current round of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls. That remains to be seen, but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment, and heroic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial transparency. 
Where has Enron's board of directors been through all of this? What kind of oversight has this motley collection of academics, government sorts, and retired executives exercised for Enron shareholders? Very little, it seems. It is time Enron's board did a proper investigation, and then cleaned house -- perhaps neatly finishing with themselves.

Enron Seeks Additional Financing
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

10/29/2001
The New York Times
Page 9, Column 4
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DALLAS, Oct. 28 -- The Enron Corporation, still struggling to reassure investors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions involving its former chief financial officer, is seeking $1 billion to $2 billion in additional financing from banks, an industry official said today. 
Last week, Enron, the nation's largest energy-trading concern, used about $3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $2 billion to pay off commercial paper. Now, by obtaining even more financing, Enron is hoping to convince investors and other energy-trading firms that it will not face a cash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or do business with it.
Enron's board, which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last two weeks to monitor the company's financial situation, held another meeting this afternoon. ''The board is meeting frequently and will announce any actions when appropriate,'' an Enron spokesman said. 
Two weeks ago, Enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced by $1.2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last week. The company also disclosed about $1 billion in separate write-offs, and it said last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission had made an inquiry into its financial accounting. 
Enron hopes to maintain its investment-grade credit rating, which is crucial to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it. Lately, Enron's bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds, and two major credit-rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the company's rating.

GLOBAL INVESTING: Enron stock plunge deals a heavy blow to mutual funds 
Financial Times; Oct 29, 2001
By AGENCIES: AGENCY MATERIAL and ELIZABETH WINE

Enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week,doing severe damage to mutual funds, the company's largest institutional ownership bloc, and the havoc may continue. 
More than 15 per cent of the 4,000 US equity funds held shares in the embattled company's shares as of the most recent reporting period, according to fund tracker Morningstar. 
Mutual funds held a fifth of Enron's shares, but that percentage is likely to be much lower now, say fund analysts, who suggest much of the stock's halving in October is due to large sales by institutional holders. 
Janus, the growth fund specialist, was the largest institutional shareholder according to the most recent filings, dated June 30, with more than 42m shares representing a stake worth Dollars 2.1bn. 
The stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth Dollars 659m at Friday's closing price of Dollars 15.40. Enron shares dropped 95 cents, or 5.81 per cent on Friday, taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last week on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships created by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. On Friday, several leading rating agencies put the company's debt on credit watches, and Enron bond prices plunged. The company's stock is down 81 per cent since January. 
Most fund managers, including those at Janus, refuse to discuss a company in which they are actively trading. However, several mutual fund groups with large Enron stakes have said their listed positions are ""dated"", implying that the funds' positions in the company have changed. 
Morningstar analyst Christine Benz, who follows the Janus funds, said managers of the group's larger funds had been ""lightening up"" their Enron holdings this year. She said Blaine Rollins, who manages the Dollars 23bn flagship Janus fund, said that in September he had sold some of his stake - listed as 2.15 per cent of outstanding shares as of April 30 - but did not say when. 
Ken Zschappel, manager of the Dollars 11bn Aim Constellation fund, also declined to discuss his holdings, listed as 0.27 per cent of outstanding shares as of March 31. But Aim said the position had since been ""trimmed substantially"". 
Other top fund owners, as of the most recent filings, included the Alliance Premier Growth fund, the Janus Twenty, Janus Mercury and Janus Growth & Income funds, Fidelity Magellan, AXP New Dimensions Fund, Putnam Investors, Putnam Voyager and Putnam New Opportunities funds and Morgan Stanley Dividend Growth fund.

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers.
By SIMON LONDON and SHEILA MCNULTY.

10/29/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers - Once a paragon of the new economy, the US energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free-wheeling management, write Simon London and Sheila McNulty. 
Enron has some explaining to do. For the past decade or more, the Texas-based company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school professors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast-growing energy trader. Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind.
Its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating multi-million dollar deals with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer, which resulted in a $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity. A hastily-convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these ""related-party transactions"". The departure of Andy Fastow, the aforementioned CFO, soon followed. 
With its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies, Enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines. Yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity. 
""This marks the end of Enron's walk on the wild side,"" observes Curt Launer, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank. 
On the surface, events at Enron can be explained by the combination of deteriorating trading conditions, a complex capital structure and poor investor relations. But the root causes go back further. The entrepreneurial culture and dynamic management that fuelled Enron's growth in the 1990s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis. Therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle ""new economy"" magic on to old economy companies. 
Enron's transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of Jeffrey Skilling, who was hired from McKinsey, the management consulting firm, to develop energy trading. 
For the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulating US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay, a former deputy under-secretary of energy. Mr Lay remains chairman. But it was Mr Skilling who spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying it. 
The two sides of the business - trading and generation/supply - have always been strange bedfellows. The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility. Mr Skilling's answer in the early 1990s was to bring in talent from outside the company. One of his first recruits was Mr Fastow, an expert in securitisation, the repackaging of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets. 
The energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself. A management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice-president, director, manager and associate/ analyst - much like a consulting firm. Employees were free to take as much holiday as they liked, so long as they delivered results. As one of Mr Skilling's early recruits recalled: ""It was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules."" 
The seemingly free-wheeling style was based on a ""loose-tight"" management model expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, the management writers and McKinsey alumni. At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy business were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets. 
Up-and-coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory. Louise Kitchen, the 32-year-old British executive who was the creative force behind Enron Online, the group's internet-based trading platform, changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years. 
Balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of risk, legal commitments, finance and performance evaluation/remuneration. Mr Skilling once described the approach in this way: ""As long as you clear your deals or business ideas through those screens, you can do whatever you want around here."" 
This approach did deliver growth and innovation. As well as making markets in its core energy products, Enron now trades everything from weather derivatives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable climatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals. The success of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world's leading e-commerce company. 
It has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint venture with International Business Machines and America Online, the internet service provider. 
In February this year Mr Skilling got his reward: he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 most powerful US corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as IBM, AT&T, Bank of America and Boeing. 
In retrospect, however, this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was achieved at a price. First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling. In August he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job. Personal, non-health related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanation. 
A second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity. In order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded, Enron used a range of off-balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion. LJM, the private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role, is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enron's accounts. Other financing vehicles include Osprey, Marlin, Whitewing, Atlantic Water Trust and Azurix. ""They went after too many things too quickly,"" says Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency. 
A third cost, associated with the last, was a loss of financial transparency. The group's extensive use of swaps, options and other derivative financial instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have little idea of how Enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to which it is exposed. 
David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, summed up the views of many investors during last week's conference call. He told the group's management: ""The company's credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need for much more disclosure. There is an appearance that you are hiding something or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable."" 
The fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus. ""The problems, in our view, stem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skills,"" argues Raymond Niles, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ""Power plants in India, water companies, extension of their franchise to the mass retail market, and using a fibre-optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated, or only tangentially related, to their core merchant energy business."" 
Enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for some of these ventures. This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enron Broadband was a business worth $35bn ( #24bn) in its own right. This helped push the share price to all-time highs - and storing up trouble when trading volumes failed to materialise. 
""They over-promised on the new business they created,"" says Chris Bartlett, a professor at Harvard Business School and long-time watcher of the company. ""Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the broadband business. To some extent they are now paying the price."" 
Will Enron weather the storm? Notwithstanding the risk of further out-of-the-blue financial shocks, most analysts believe that it will. The merchant energy business remains powerful and profitable. Mr Niles at Salomon Smith Barney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent of earnings and has shown consistent 30-40 per cent annual growth over the past three years. Assets totalling more than $4bn were also earmarked for disposal before the current crisis erupted, underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the group's portfolio of physical energy assets. 
And yet the doubts remain. It is, ultimately, a question of confidence and credibility. Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight management methods has tilted too far towards the former. Mr Lay and his team will have to tighten up.

Enron, the troubled US energy group, was attempting yesterday to persuade banks to provide additional credit to bolster its position after a sharp fall in its share price. 
The Houston-based company was also due last night to hold a special board meeting to consider confidence-building measures after surprise financial disclosures damaged its reputation among US investors.
Last week the company raised $3.3bn (Euros 3.7bn) in cash to bolster its financial position but Enron admitted yesterday that it was still looking for additional finance. The company insisted, however, that it was in good financial health and that its core energy trading business remained strong. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said he hoped the company would have something to announce in coming days from its latest effort to ""establish additional lines of liquidity"". ""Once we are able to get the liquidity position shored up, that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest,"" Mr Palmer said. 
The company's problems have become public since an announcement on October 16 that it would take a $1.01bn special charge and write down shareholders' equity by another $1.2bn. The moves followed losses arising from a private equity operation run by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer, who was forced to take a leave of absence last week. 
Enron's share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the October 16 announcement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically ""junk"" status, though its official ratings are still investment grade. 
""Our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their ability to operate their trading and marketing operations,"" said Raymond Niles of Salomon Smith Barney. ""These activities require at least an investment grade credit rating, or Enron could be subject to an increase in margin requirements."" 
The controversy over Enron's balance sheet adjustment has resulted in a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Enron flickers, Page 22.

Enron Seeks Further Credit to Reassure Investors, WSJ Says
2001-10-29 04:30 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide a further credit line of as
much as $2 billion in a bid to restore investor confidence in the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified
officials close to negotiations.

     The new credit line is additional to the $3.3 billion credit
line it tapped last week, the paper said, and should be completed
within days.

     Investors have shunned the company since Oct. 16 when Enron
reported a third quarter loss of $618 million and wrote down
shareholders' equity by another $1.2 billion, the Journal said.
The stock has fallen by 54 percent since the announcement.

     The company's shares were further dented after an investor
sued Enron last month, saying dealings with two partnerships run
by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, cost the company
$35 million. The suit also called Fastow's leadership of the
partnerships, set up to cut Enron's debt, a conflict of interest.



USA: REPEAT-Electric cowboys get roped in at the energy corral.
By Janet McGurty

NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Last year, Enron Corp. was a darling of investors and analysts, but the freewheeling trader of electricity and natural gas now faces a credibility crisis due to a lack of transparency in its business dealings. 
Enron, trying to shake investor jitters over a possible downgrade of its credit worthiness and their unease over the company's complex financial transactions, has seen its shares shed more than half their market value in the past week.
But the largest natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States is not alone in getting its wings clipped as energy prices come down and the market volatility that drove earnings last year eases. 
While Enron's problems differ from more traditional utilities, many other power producers are returning to their roots. They are scrapping plans for splitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy. 
Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amro, said there are common themes affecting the industry. 
""One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth,"" Patterson said. 
As earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward, some power companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment. And plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off. 
Shares of Enron slid $1.05, or 6.4 percent, to $15.30 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. 
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED 
AES Corp. , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consecutive quarter on a poor showing from operations in Brazil and Britain, said Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off assets. 
""It's a different place,"" AES' chief executive officer Dennis Bakke said of the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year's powerful growth. On Friday, Constellation Energy Group , parent company of Baltimore Gas & Electric, scrapped plans to split its power generation and trading operations into two company because of economic changes. Constellation also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with Goldman Sachs, which planned to make an equity investment in the company. 
""The utility industry and energy markets, and indeed the entire U.S. economy, have changed considerably in the past year. As a combined company, we will be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver,"" said Christian Poindexter, Constellation's chairman. 
RETURN TO TRADITIONAL VALUES 
Bakke said one prong of AES's brave, new world scenario was a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term contract generation business. 
It makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 80 percent of their generating capacity into long-term contracts because it provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth, according to Gordon Howald, energy analyst with Credit Lyonnaise. 
""Calpine does it already,"" he said, referring to the California-based independent power producer that has the lion's share of the power it generates contracted out. ""What drove the valuations in all these companies last year was that power markets were very inefficient. Physical reserve margins were low. But with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case - there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywhere near that level,"" he added. 
Howald said with all the new generation coming on, natural gas prices should remain high but power prices should come down further, squeezing spark spreads, or profit margins, for solely gas fired companies. 
SMALLER COMPANIES ALSO RETHINK STRATEGIES 
As lower power prices impact earnings, many power companies are turning back to U.S. markets to try to maximize their bottom line. 
""Earnings for the quarter is not the big deal. The big deal is that for 2002 they are not going to earn as much as people expected. It's a downward revision of earnings guidance."" said Patterson. 
Michigan-based CMS Energy Corp. cut its earnings estimates for the second time to $2 to $2.05 for 2002, down from $2.79 and said it would sell off certain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in North America. 
CMS, whose earnings were down for the third quarter, said it took a charge for planned divestitures, includingdiscontinued South American energy distribution units as well as other international investments. 
Allegheny Energy Inc. also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in third quarter earnings. 
The Maryland-based company said while it is continuing to work towards getting necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold its unregulated assets, it will not proceed with the offering at this time. 
""The company will integrated until market conditions are such that demonstrated value can and will be created for shareholders,"" Allegheny said.

Enron seeks new credit line; reportedly for 1-2 bln usd

Copyright 2001 AFX News; Source: World Reporter (TM)

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp is negotiating with banks for a new credit line, a spokesman told the Wall Street Journal. 
The company is in talks to raise between 1-2 bln usd and is likely to close a deal within days, it quoted officials familiar with the matter as saying.
The deal, which is intended to head off a potential loss of investor and business confidence, would supplement existing lines. These are largely tapped out after Enron last week drew down about 3 bln usd to increase cash reserves and calm market fears. 
Enron earlier this month announced a heavy third quarter loss and erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.

Enron Said Seeking New Credit Lines
BY LAURA MANDARO and ALISSA SCHMELKIN

The Texas energy and telecommunications giant Enron Corp. was reportedly negotiating with its lenders about new credit lines Friday, a day after it drew down billions on its existing lines. 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are the two banking companies with the largest lending exposure to the $67 billion-asset Houston company, with an estimated $400 to $500 million in bank debt outstanding ""in addition to derivatives and other structured product exposures,"" according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Lori Applebaum.
Morgan Chase and Citi were the book runners on a 364-day, $2.25 billion loan facility to Enron that closed in May, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. Credit Suisse First Boston was the sole bookrunner on a $582 million loan to the company that closed in March and matures in March 2004, the data company said. Bank of America, Citigroup, and Deutsche Bank also participated, Securities Data said. 
On Thursday, Enron issued a statement that ""in order to dispel uncertainty in the financial community,"" it had drawn on its committed lines of credit to provide over $1 billion of cash liquidity. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Enron drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and was in talks about obtaining a new multibillion-dollar line. 
""We continue to have conversations new our creditors about new liquidity -- that's nothing out of the ordinary,"" said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. 
The developments followed a $638 million loss for the third quarter, the departure of Enron's chief financial officer, and a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. 
Enron, a natural gas company that has broadened its focus to include energy trading, transport, risk-management, and telecommunications products and services, has relationships with banks that extend beyond credit lines. 
""Citi, J.P. Morgan, and possibly Wachovia and Bank of America also invested along with Enron in some of its partnerships,"" said Ms. Applebaum. A spokesman for Morgan Chase confirmed that the bank was a lender but said he did not know the amount of its exposure. 
Many other regional banks have participated in credit facilities to Enron. Bank of America Corp. is estimated to have about $200 million to $300 million of exposure; Bank One Corp. about $100 million; and Wachovia Corp., SunTrust Banks Inc., and FleetBoston Financial Corp. about $50 million each, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. Bank of New York has between $50 to $100 million of exposure, and Northern Trust, U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp also have some lending exposure, Ms. Applebaum said. 
Representatives of these banks would not comment on their relationships with Enron, or did not return phone calls by deadline.

USA: Enron in talks for $1-2 bln credit line - WSJ.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. is negotiating with banks for a new credit line of between $1 billion and $2 billion and could close a deal within days, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Monday. 
According to officials close to the situation, the new credit would supplement existing credit lines, largely tapped out after the company drew down about $3 billion last week to increase cash reserves and calm jittery investors' fears, the Journal reported.
The paper said that an Enron spokesman had confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line, but could not supply any further details. 
Confidence in Enron has been shattered following disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships. Its stock has tumbled amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the company's ousted Chief Financial Officer's links to some of the partnerships.

JAPAN: Japan's Teijin, Enron study coal-fired power plant.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japan's major polyester manufacturer, Teijin Ltd , said on Monday it would conduct a feasibility study with U.S. energy giant Enron Corp on building a coal-fired power plant. 
Teijin said in a statement that it and E Power Corp, a Japanese affiliate of Enron Corp, would look into building the 70,000 kilowatt coal-burning thermal power plant in Matsuyama, Ehime prefecture, on the southwestern island of Shikoku, where Teijin has a polyester plant.
""We are beginning to consider selling surplus power to third parties other than our own plants, with eyes on further deregulation in Japan's power market,"" a Teijin spokesman said. 
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last year, large-lot consumers have been free to choose their suppliers. 
In its polyester business, Teijin has expanded overseas output while reducing domestic production, a trend which would leave it with surplus power. It is thus looking at how to make good use of any surplus. 
The two firms were also considering expanding the capacity of Teijin's existing power generator in Matsuyama, Teijin said. It hopes to reduce costs at the inefficient small plant with the help of Enron. 
Enron Corp said earlier this year it had presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a power plant in Japan. 
The Teijin spokesman said the two firms hoped to conclude the feasibility study by June 2002. 
Teijin's shares ended the day down 13 yen or 2.68 percent at 472 yen.

Enron, Teijin to Build Power Plant in Japan, Report Says
2001-10-28 23:39 (New York)


     Tokyo, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. and Teijin Ltd.
will jointly build a coal-fired power plant in southwestern Japan
as early as 2004, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said on its wire
service, without citing sources.

     Enron, the world's biggest energy trader, and synthetic-
fiber maker Teijin will together spend 1 billion yen ($8.16
million) to build the 70,000-kilowatt plant in Ehime, southwest of
Tokyo, the report said.

     Enron wants to eventually build bigger plants and sell
electricity directly to large commercial users without going
through exiting utilities, the report said.

Once-Mighty Enron Strains Under Scrutiny
By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

IS time running out for Enron? 
At the beginning of this year, the Enron Corporation, the world's dominant energy trader, appeared unstoppable. The company's decade-long effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from California to New York. Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its views would be heard in Washington. Its sales, profits and stock were soaring.
And under the leadership of Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive, Enron's arrogance had grown even more quickly. 
The company, based in Houston, dripped contempt for the regulators and consumer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets -- for electricity, water and everything else. Everyone would win under deregulation, Enron said -- especially its shareholders, whose stock would soar as the company profited from creating new markets. 
''We are on the side of angels,'' Mr. Skilling said in March, dismissing those who saw the company as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. ''People want to have open, competitive markets. They want fair competition. It's the American way.'' 
But less than a year later, everybody seems to have lost, especially Enron's investors. Enron's stock is plunging, and questions about its finances are mounting. 
Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens, trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile. In a worst-case outlook, Enron could become the 2001 version of Long-Term Capital Management, the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998. Enron's shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year, erasing $50 billion in shareholder value. 
Enron closed on Friday at $15.40, down 95 cents, after hitting a 52-week low of $15.04 earlier in the day. 
The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt, thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in California earlier this year -- a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation's basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market. Enron's efforts to become a profit-making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures. In August, Mr. Skilling quit, forcing Kenneth L. Lay, his predecessor as chief executive and still Enron's chairman, to resume day-to-day control of the company. 
The company declined to make senior executives, including Mr. Lay, available for comment, and asked that questions be submitted in writing. Mr. Skilling could not be reached. 
Enron's problems boiled over earlier this month, when it disclosed that its shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in Enron's regular financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the company's financial reporting, and some investors question whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas. 
THE slump in the company's shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall in its shareholders' equity. On Wednesday, the company forced out its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who is at the center of the controversy over Enron's confusing finances. The company, which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from California's energy crisis, today faces a potential cash crunch. 
The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors' smoldering concern about Enron's opaque financial statements. Now, with Wall Street analysts and bond-rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company's profits, Enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash. 
Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash. On Thursday, the company drew down a $3.3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, which have each extended at least $400 million. But because of Enron's importance in the natural gas and electricity markets, industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide. 
The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed, because Enron is mainly a trader, rather than a producer, of energy. But a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices, which have swung wildly in the last year. 
Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy-markets economist, emphasized that he thought Enron would survive this crisis. But he said it was not clear what would happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company's EnronOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations. 
''You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there -- are they good? Are the firm's hedges good? What's the situation?'' Mr. Verleger said. ''It's got everyone scared.'' 
In the short run, Enron's credit rating may be its biggest problem. If the company's rating falls below investment grade, Enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed. But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable, because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company. 
A drop in the company's credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with Enron, hurting the company's sales and profits. 
Enron's credit rating stands several notches above the critical point. But its bonds, which are publicly traded, have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent, comparable with many junk bonds. Two of the three major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Investors Service, have put Enron's bonds on review for possible downgrades. 
''The issue that's in the front of everybody's mind right now is credit,'' said Mark Gurley, senior vice president and general manager for trading at Aquila Inc., one of the nation's largest energy traders. Aquila is based in Kansas City, Mo. 
For now, Aquila and other major energy traders and producers, including Reliant Energy, the El Paso Corporation and Dynegy, are continuing to do business with Enron. And Mr. Gurley said that Enron's own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. 
''They haven't done anything trading-wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down,'' he said. 
Still, some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with Enron, especially long-term contracts. They also said risk-management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said on Friday that no energy-trading company had stopped doing business with Enron. He declined to say whether any of the company's trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms. He said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business. 
But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront. For years, the details of Enron's finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street analysts whose job it is to follow the company, and to the investors who own its stock and bonds. When Enron's profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets, shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements. 
Now they do. Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask. 
To others in the industry, the opaqueness of the company's financial statements parallels Enron's efforts to keep its energy-trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements. Though they do not expect Enron to crumble like Long-Term Capital Management, they say that, like the giant hedge fund, Enron uses a lot of debt, regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances. 
The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet. With names like Marlin and Osprey, the partnerships have at least $3.3 billion in bonds outstanding, backed by assets like a stake in Azurix, Enron's water company subsidiary. Enron has promised that if the partnerships' debts exceed the value of their assets, Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference. 
DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr. Fastow, who was chief financial officer when they were organized, led to the $1.2 billion write-off in shareholders' equity that Enron announced last week. The company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships. 
Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter, after being criticized by shareholders. In the process, it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books, reducing its shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion. But, because of complex accounting rules, the transaction was not apparent in Enron's quarterly earnings report. 
The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have found a way to hide losses, throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question. When Enron released third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16, it reported a loss from $1 billion in write-offs on failed investments. The earnings statement did not mention the additional $1.2 billion equity write-down. But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable, and its shares rose. 
In a conference call with analysts after the announcement, Mr. Lay, Enron's chairman, also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity. The reference was a brief one, however, and some listeners did not catch it. Those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done, and many were confused by the accounting procedure. Enron's stock began to slide, and investors clamored for more information about the write-off. But so far, the company's efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors. 
Mr. Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals, but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts about Mr. Lay's grasp of the situation. They say that the two people at Enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals -- Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow -- have both left the company. 
In an interview in late August, Mr. Lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving Mr. Fastow. In response to one question about them, he said, ''You're getting way over my head.'' 
Mr. Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr. Lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue, saying Mr. Lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the S.E.C. investigation. ''There is not a whole lot we can say, or should say, about them,'' Mr. Palmer said. He also said the company expected to generate about $3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year. 
In a conference call on Tuesday, analysts pressed Mr. Lay and other top Enron executives to reveal more information about the LJM write-down and its other partnerships. Instead, they offered only vague explanations of the deal, leaving Wall Street worried that more write-offs might be coming. 
David Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company, was among those who came away concerned. ''If Enron is unable to clarify its off-balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets,'' he wrote in a research note after the call. 
To try to reassure investors, Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline, its Internet-based trading exchange, executed more than 8,400 trades that day, a higher-than-normal volume. 
''We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community -- and we're working on that,'' Mr. Lay said in a statement. ''But in the meantime, the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron.'' 
But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street. Enron's stock tumbled almost 6 percent Friday, to its lowest levels in six years. 
Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off-balance-sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees. 
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates that Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said that Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign assets -- including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India embroiled in a dispute with the state government -- and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring economy. 
''As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs, they may have to write those assets down,'' Ms. Coale said. On Wednesday, she downgraded her rating on Enron to ''sell'' from ''neutral.'' 
''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts,'' Ms. Coale said. 
Short-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company disclosed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than analysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money-losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they say. 
''The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core business, the trading business, is profitable,'' said Mark Roberts, director of research at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May 7, when it stood at $59.43. ''The issue remains: why are they doing these transactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that profitable.'' 
James Chanos, a leading short-seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fall, said, ''Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the losses when deals go against it?'' Mr. Palmer of Enron said the company stood by its reported energy-trading profits. 
Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced -- meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, in roughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy. 
''With these guys, they tell us -- and all you've got is their word -- that they're hedged,'' said Mr. Verleger, the economist. 
IN fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet-trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices. 
Large-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years. Enron pioneered the business, and now dominates it, accounting for about one-quarter of all trading in the United States. 
Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity, a process that began in earnest a decade ago, the power business was a simpler affair. Utilities were given areas of monopoly service, and their rates -- and ability to deliver enough electricity -- were overseen by state regulators. But with the move to deregulate the business, independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished, providing an ever-growing portion of the nation's power. 
Beginning in the 1980's, the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated, spurring Enron, which used to be primarily a gas-pipeline company, to move into the trading business. 
The company's shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid-1990's, with the ascension of Mr. Skilling, who became chief executive in February, just six months before his unexpected resignation. Underscoring the change in direction, in securities filings this year Enron described its principal business as ''security brokers, dealers and flotation.'' Before, it had said it was in the business of ''wholesale-petroleum and petroleum products.'' 
For most of its ascent, Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall Street accepted them with pleasure. A year ago, when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by Mr. Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer, analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr. Fastow's involvement. 
Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch. But the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short-term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring. The controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year -- unless Enron loses its investment-grade credit rating before that. 
ENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions, which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enron's credit. When Long-Term Capital was stumbling in 1998, some Wall Street rivals sold the securities they thought Long-Term owned, trying to force Long-Term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss. Something similar in energy markets might be possible. If so, Enron might find, as Long-Term did, that positions that should offset each other do not. 
Enron's new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company's profits are real, and that its condition is better than the short-sellers believe. As questions are answered, confidence, and the share price, could rebound. 
But for now, investors are skittish, and some competitors are eager to take advantage of Enron's plight.

Plumbing Mystery Of Deals By Enron
By FLOYD NORRIS

c. 2001 New York Times Company

AT the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Corporation are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. Because they were transactions among related parties, the company was required to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they answered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the currently available answers. 
Q. Why did Enron enter into the deals?
A. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it said it was seeking to ''hedge certain merchant investments and other assets,'' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommunications companies. 
Q. How did those investments do? 
A. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclosure on that. 
Q. Why can't that be discerned? 
A. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transactions with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivative securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangements completely. 
Q. Why were they so complicated? 
A. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One accounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each and then buys them back -- whether for $1 or $50 -- there is no gain or loss. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet -- in that case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fall under that rule. 
Q. Who made money from these transactions? 
A. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not all of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears that the partnerships distributed money to investors. 
Q. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now? 
A. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted profits each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being disclosed was not really important. 
Q. When were concerns raised with Enron? 
A. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By this summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partnerships. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered related to Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the transactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out its deals with the partnerships. 
Q. How did Enron do? 
A. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transactions involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it also reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. 
Q. How did that happen? 
A. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnership owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enron. In return, Enron terminated ''previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods.'' Enron treated that like a share buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings. 
Q. Is that legal under the accounting rules? 
A. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on them. That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRIS

Investors Seem to Ignore Discouraging News
By MICHAEL BRICK

The New York Times

c. 2001 New York Times Company

Investors sent stocks markedly higher last week, despite reports on the economy and corporate profits that were resoundingly poor. 
The Dow Jones industrial average, strengthened by triple-digit rallies on Monday and Thursday, ended the week nearly back to its level of Sept. 10, one day before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Broader indicators ended slightly higher than they were on Sept. 10.
Investors overcame their initial discouragement about reports that orders for durable goods and sales of existing homes were deteriorating faster than expected. They also seemed unfazed by reports of corporate profits declining from a year ago, at some companies by more than 30 percent. 
All the bad news, investors seemed to surmise, meant that the government was more likely to act aggressively in stimulating the economy, with tax breaks, spending and lower interest rates. 
The Dow average gained 341.06, or 3.7 percent, to close at 9,545.17. The Nasdaq composite index rose 97.65 points, or 5.8 percent, to 1,768.96. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 31.13, or 2.9 percent, to 1,104.61.

Enron Asks Banks for More Credit After Stock Slide, FT Reports
2001-10-28 20:20 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide further credit after tapping
a $3.3 billion credit line last week to bolster investor
confidence, the Financial Times reported, citing company sources.

     Enron's stock has fallen more than 50 percent since Oct. 17
when an investor sued the company for conflict of interest over
transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow.

     The company has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans since announcing Oct. 16 it would take
a $1.01 billion special charge and write down shareholders' equity
by another $1.2 billion, the FT said.

     Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said he hoped the company would
announce the new financing facility in coming days, the newspaper
said.

The vote is in. Lockheed Martin Corp. won the coveted right to build the nation's next-generation fighter aircraft, beating out Boeing Co. for what could be the biggest military contract ever. 
Culminating a five-year battle between two of the world's largest defense contractors, Pentagon officials picked Lockheed Martin to begin development of the Joint Strike Fighter, with plans to purchase 3,000 of the planes at a cost of more than $200 billion.
With the potential for foreign sales topping another $200 billion, the contract is considered the most lucrative in U.S. history. ""This really is the contract of the millennium,"" said Christopher Hellman, analyst with the Center for Defense Information. ""Nothing has or will come close. ""

Ford Settles Lawsuit Over Faulty Part 
In the largest automotive class-action settlement in history, Ford Motor Co. will reimburse customers who paid hundreds of millions of dollars to replace a faulty part that caused their vehicles to stall. 
It was uncertain how many consumers would qualify for reimbursements in the range of $160 apiece. 
The settlement caps six years of litigation. Plaintiffs' lawyers said the cost to Ford would be as high as $2.7 billion.

AMR Posts Record Loss in Quarter 
Even though more Americans are flying again, the airline industry continues to reel and its problems are expected to worsen this holiday season. 
AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, the world's largest airline, posted a record loss for the third quarter, even after getting $508 million in federal financial aid. 
Although the number of passengers has kept growing each week since the Sept. 11 attacks, about 20% fewer people are flying. 
Less than a month before the busy Thanksgiving weekend, American Airlines says advance bookings for November are down 6% from a year earlier. 
Meanwhile, the airlines are now reporting a little-noticed aspect of the government rescue package: They have to pay federal taxes on the cash grants.

ITC Says Imports Hurt Steel Industry 
The International Trade Commission ruled that foreign imports pose a serious threat to the domestic steel industry, paving the way for punitive sanctions that are likely to raise steel prices and intensify trade tensions with Europe and Asia. 
The independent U.S. agency has until mid-December to provide the White House with a list of proposed remedies, which could include import quotas or hefty tariffs on foreign steel. 
Beleaguered U.S. steelmakers applauded the decision. 
President Bush, who instigated the ITC investigation, is expected to approve the protective measures, though critics warn they could harm a weakened domestic economy and complicate efforts to launch a new round of global trade talks.

Shares of Enron Plummet Amid Losses 
Enron Corp.'s stock was pummeled by investors following disclosures of losses and shrinking shareholders' equity related to failed investments and a complicated hierarchy of limited partnerships used to shelter some Enron assets. 
The stock slide was compounded by disclosure of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into two of the partnership arrangements and by Wall Street worries about future cash flow and credit problems that might be caused by the investment vehicles. 
Two conference calls with analysts and investors failed to calm nerves, and several analysts lowered their recommendations on Enron. 
Enron has reiterated that its finances are strong. And although analysts note that Enron's core businesses remain sound, some analysts doubt that the usually taciturn company has revealed all of its problems. 
To mollify investors, Enron replaced its chief financial officer, who until recently headed the two partnerships the SEC is eyeing.

Pentagon OKs Northrop Bid for Newport News 
Northrop Grumman Corp. was all but assured of winning the bid to acquire Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. as the Pentagon endorsed the deal and the Justice Department, citing antitrust concerns, blocked a rival bid by General Dynamics Corp. 
It marked a stunning turn of events for Northrop, which got the nod to acquire the Virginia builder of nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers despite having been the underdog. 
The Los Angeles-based defense contractor made an unsolicited offer for Newport News after the shipbuilder had inked a $2.1-billion deal with General Dynamics. 
Separately, Northrop said third-quarter earnings fell 22% because of a large drop in pension fund investments.

Hollywood Production Jobs Fall to 4-Year Low 
Skittishness following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks has exacerbated an already slow season in Hollywood, pushing employment in the movie, television and film industry to a four-year low in September, state statistics show. 
Cutbacks and delayed projects by the major studios has trickled down through the industry, leading to a spate of layoffs at small companies that provide equipment and services for the industry.

Grammy Officials Urge Greene Settlement 
High-ranking officials at the Grammy organization recommended a settlement of more than half a million dollars to resolve sexual assault and battery allegations against the nonprofit group's chief executive, C. Michael Greene, Grammy sources said. 
The proposed settlement, subject to approval by the group's board of directors, has ignited an internal revolt, with at least a dozen of the 41 trustees privately calling for Greene's firing, the sources said. 
Greene declined to comment. Attorneys for the Grammy nonprofit group previously denied that Greene assaulted or had any sexual contact with Jill Geimer, the Grammy executive who has threatened to sue over Greene's alleged misconduct. 
Chuck Philips 
EMI Ousts Record Label Executive Nancy Berry 
British music conglomerate EMI Group sacked Nancy Berry, the vice chairwoman of its worldwide Virgin Records division. 
Berry's exit came a week after the London-based record company ousted its global record chief, Ken Berry, who is Nancy Berry's former husband. 
The shake-up follows a dispiriting period for EMI, including a disastrous sales debut from pop icon Mariah Carey, who suffered a nervous breakdown months after signing an $80-million contract with the company this year. Nancy Berry spearheaded the elaborate marketing campaign for Carey's album, ""Glitter,"" which has sold fewer than 400,000 copies since its Sept. 11 debut. 
Jeff Leeds 
Management Buyout of G&L Realty Approved 
Stockholders of G&L Realty Corp. approved a management-led buyout of the real estate investment trust despite a higher offer by a rival group and concerns that the deal unfairly favors top executives. 
The company's co-chairmen, Daniel Gottlieb and Steven Lebowitz, plan to take the small Beverly Hills-based company private after a majority of shareholders backed their $12-a-share offer. 
The management-led offer triggered a shareholder lawsuit this year that claimed G&L's board breached its fiduciary duty

Internet Archive Turns Back Web Pages of Time 
The nonprofit Internet Archive launched its so-called Wayback Machine, allowing Web surfers to check out most Internet sites that have vanished and older versions of sites that are still around. 
The San Francisco effort is the brainchild of Brewster Kahle, a millionaire technologist who wants to preserve the Internet's ephemera for generations to come. 
Like many Internet pioneers, however, Kahle faces unfamiliar risks along with the opportunities: the archive might be the most massive violation of copyright law since ownership rights over words came into being. 
More than 10 billion pages are available at http://web.archive.org.

Job Cuts, Make-Over in Store for Sears 
Sears, Roebuck & Co. is getting a new look, borrowing from competitors that have been biting into Sears bottom line. 
In a bid the company says will increase operating income by $1 billion during the next three years, Sears will look more like a mass merchant, with more self-serve areas and centralized checkouts. 
As part of its financial realignment, Sears will cut 4,900 jobs in the next 18 months. 
The company's challenge, analysts say, is to offer something unique within its niche of serving middle-income consumers--an ever difficult proposition against innovative rivals such as Kohl's and Target.

Devon Energy makes building its own with major lease

(Copyright 2001)

HOUSTON is known as the ""Energy Capital of the World."" And a glance around the downtown skyline proves the nickname is appropriate. Houston skyscrapers bearing the names of Enron, Chevron, Exxon and Shell make significant contributions to the view. 
Now another name is being added to the downtown mix, enhancing the energy capital image even further. The 36-story Two Allen Center has been renamed Devon Energy Tower.
Devon Energy has just signed a lease for 193,000 square feet of space, more than doubling its presence in the building, and as part of the deal, Devon gets to put its name on the structure. 
The lease also gives Oklahoma City-based Devon the right to take more space in the 1 million-square-foot building, at 1212 Smith St. 
Devon recently announced its plans to acquire Mitchell Energy & Development, but it will maintain Mitchell's offices in The Woodlands, said Klay Kimker, manager of office administration for Devon. 
Kevin Snodgrass and Tim Relyea of Cushman & Wakefield represented Devon in the transaction. Paul Frazier and Margaret Sigur negotiated the deal on behalf of TrizecHahn Office Properties, the owner of the building. 
TrizecHahn owns both the Allen Center and Cullen Center office complexes, a total of 6 million square feet of space in downtown. The TrizecHahn office space is nearly full right now, but Enron will be vacating large amounts of space there next year when the nearby Enron building is complete. 
Teamsters to build facilities 
Teamsters Union officials are planning to build new headquarters facilities after the union sells its building on the Katy Freeway. 
To replace the Katy Freeway building, the union expects to build two smaller structures near Bush Intercontinental Airport to house different chapters, said A.W. Parker, secretary treasurer of Local 968. 
Parker's group is expecting to build a 13,000-square-foot building at Ella Boulevard at Beltway 8. 
Another Teamsters group has purchased 4.5 acres on Beltway 8 at Diplomatic Plaza Drive, in the World Houston Business Center. The land was purchased from the Licha Family Trust. Tony Patronella and Marc Drumwright, both of Southwest Realty Advisors, handled the sale. 
Chicago firm buying property 
A Chicago real estate investment firm is on a quest to acquire suburban office buildings in Houston. 
ML Capital Ventures has purchased two small office structures: the 71,736-square-foot building at 5500 Northwest Central Drive and the 66,338-square-foot building at 5301 Hollister. The building on Northwest Central Drive is the headquarters of BJ Services energy company. 
Mike Luecht, president of ML Capital, said his firm will acquire two additional Houston office buildings before the end of the year. 
ML Capital, which has been in business for eight months, will exceed Luecht's initial plan to buy more than $22 million worth of suburban office space in Houston in the company's start-up phase. 
Luecht said his firm was bullish on two types of real estate: buying warehouses in Chicago and buying office buildings in suburban Houston. Houston's economy has been adding jobs and it is a promising market that is overlooked by many investors, Luecht said. Many investors have been too slow to forget the devastating meltdown of Houston realty market in the 1980s, Luecht said. 
In its most recent deal, ML Ventures bought the 5500 Northwest Central building in partnership with Avgeris & Associates of Chicago. Tom Bousquet of CB Richard Ellis brokered the deal. 
Woodlands opens new section 
Several $1 million home sites go up for sale this weekend as The Woodlands opens a new section of its Carlton Woods gated community. 
The premium lots will be facing the new Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course. 
Custom lots will range in price from $150,000 to $1 million and range in size from one-fifth of an acre to two-and-three-fourths acres. 
The Carlton Woods community is the first gated community in The Woodlands and has been well received by upper-end home buyers, said Paul Lazzaro, vice president of marketing for The Woodlands. 
Thirty-two homes are under construction in Carlton Woods and all of them are priced at more than $1 million. 
A total of 208 lots have been sold in Carlton Woods, which opened about a year ago.

Enron Taps All Its Credit Lines To Buy Back $3.3 Billion of Debt
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, trying to reassure investors that it has ample liquidity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, using $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit. 
An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are completed the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash.
The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents. 
The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion. 
Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below investment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will be able to sell more commercial paper. 
Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed that its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will show a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wednesday. 
The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked questions about its accounting practices.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron's bond prices drop to warning levels.
By ROBERT CLOW, SHEILA MCNULTY and JENNY WIGGINS.

10/27/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron, the Houston-based energy trading group, continued to pay a heavy price for its lack of financial transparency yesterday as its bond prices plummeted. 
Investor confidence in Enron has declined sharply since the company announced a $1.2bn reduction of shareholder equity stemming from a complex off-balance sheet structure. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also launched an informal investigation into the company's finances.
Enron's five-year bonds were trading yesterday at 77 cents in the dollar with a yield of 11.13 per cent, down from 83 cents on Thursday. Bond prices at these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for bankruptcy. 
Late on Thursday, Enron announced that it would draw on its bank lines to buy back its outstanding commercial paper after two ratings agencies put the company on negative watch. 
Commercial paper financing, which normally has to be rolled every 90 days, is one of the first forms of financing to disappear in a crisis. 
""What they want to do is assure their clients and other trading partners that they are creditworthy and continue with business,"" said Robin West, chairman of the Petroleum Finance Company, the industry consultants. ""In a situation like this, cash is king."" 
Enron's biggest immediate business risk is that its major trading counterparties, such as Duke Energy and Reliant Resources, start asking it for more collateral, increasing the cost of its everyday business. 
If Enron were downgraded to junk, the counterparties could do just that. 
So far, credit rating analysts say, Enron's core business is holding up well. But their actions over the past few days acknowledge that the company could still be severely damaged by the scandal. 
Enron has long faced criticism of its opaque financial reporting, but its most recent problems stem from the LJM private equity fund run by Andy Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer. 
Enron compensated its partners in this complex off-balance sheet structure by promising to give them Enron shares, if the value of private equity investments in The New Power Company, technology and other things fell below a certain level. 
Those investments fell $1.2bn in value from the threshold level, which should have triggered the issue of 62m shares if the deal had not been reversed. 
The complex deal was designed to make sure Enron did not experience the same balance sheet volatility that JP Morgan Chase and others have suffered from marking their private equity investments to market.

Enron taps credit line; stock slides

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - After Enron Corp. tapped into more than $3 billion in credit in an effort to boost confidence of investors and customers, stock prices dropped. 
Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday. Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month.
The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value. 
Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short-term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 
""Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 
Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as ""good management decisions."" 
On Oct. 16 Enron's third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 
The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron. 
Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 
Reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 
""It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations,"" Feygin told the Houston Chronicle for Saturday's editions. 
Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 
""Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message,"" she said. ""Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management.""

Enron Decline Continues

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3-billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-interest, short-term loans. 
The company's stock has fallen 54% in the last 14 days after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Investors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. 
""Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,"" said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. ""People are questioning the credibility of management."" 
The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. 
The price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of BBB+, yield 9.53%. 
Investors have grown concerned that the firm's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions. 
Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ""a smart financial move,"" said Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service. ""It took away the hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital.""

Enron taps credit line; stock slides / Company says cash will boost confidence

(Copyright 2001)

Enron Corp.'s stock price hit its lowest point in more than five years Friday after it tapped into more than $3 billion in revolving credit in an effort to re-assure investors and customers. 
Shares fell 95 cents on Friday to $15.40, a level not seen since 1995, as analysts continued to muddle through a complicated series of bookkeeping issues revealed after the company's earnings announcement earlier this month. The stock is down more than 50 percent in two weeks, and the company lost almost $14 billion in market value.
Late this week the company decided to convert $3 billion in revolving credit it has through various banks into cash. The company put about $1.1 billion in the bank in an effort to reassure business partners and investors of its liquidity and is using the $2.2 billion balance to begin an orderly repurchase of a certain kind of short- term corporate IOU known as commercial paper. 
""Nothing spells confidence quite like cash, which is what we want investors to understand,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer of the $1.1 billion banked this week. 
Palmer could neither confirm nor deny that the company is negotiating further lines of credit with banks but described such actions as ""good management decisions."" 
Enron's most recent woes began Oct. 16 when its third-quarter earnings release drew renewed attention to an issue investors and analysts had previously been unhappy about: Then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, with the Enron board's approval, had formed and run two investment partnerships that could have created a conflict of interest. 
The partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron and were formed originally as a way to offset risks associated with some of the company's newer businesses such as broadband trading. 
Fastow had resigned from his roles in the partnerships months ago when Wall Street began to question whether he could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership simultaneously. But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. 
Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper. This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer, and often with more flexible terms. 
""To some extent, redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets, which look at it negatively,"" said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. 
But reducing the company's debt exposure through commercial paper and putting it back into more traditional financial tools, like a revolving line of credit, could give great peace of mind to Enron's investors, he said. 
""It helps them shore up their support behind their energy trading business, which is really the core of their operations,"" Feygin said. 
Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities, still sees the move as somewhat confusing. 
""Just last week they were touting their unused lines of credit as a plus, but the fact that they tapped those now sends a strange, mixed message,"" she said. ""Do they need the cash to keep the rating agencies off their back? Is it a gesture for customers? It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management."" 
Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned. 
In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron. That could lead to lower credit ratings, which would force Enron's energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it. 
""Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues,"" Dietert wrote in a report Friday. ""Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off."" 
Feygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store. 
For example, a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco. It was formed in 1997 with about $400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets. 
Chewco was run by Michael Kopper, a managing director of Enron's Global Equity Markets Group.

Enron says Microsoft breached contract

(Copyright 2001)

Enron Corp. filed suit against Microsoft Corp. in state district court in Houston this week, claiming the software giant breached a contract over a new high-speed Internet service. 
The companies entered into an agreement last June in which Enron would provide Internet bandwidth to Microsoft as it rolled out its MSN Broadband service. Enron's broadband network would link MSN customers in over two dozen states, including Texas.
Qwest Communications is providing the Internet infrastructure in 14 other states for MSN. 
On Oct. 23, Microsoft said that Enron would have breached the contract if it didn't provide an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, according to Bloomberg News. In the lawsuit, Enron claims Microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system it needed to deliver its end of the project's first phase. 
The lawsuit appears to be blocking the launch of the MSN service in all but the 14 states served by Qwest. 
Enron officials declined to comment. A Microsoft spokesman said the company had not reviewed the filing but was ""confident that we have upheld our agreement with Enron.""

How to Lose a War
By Frank Rich

10/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 19, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Welcome back to Sept. 10. 
The ''America Strikes Back'' optimism that surged after Sept. 11 has now been stricken by the multitude of ways we're losing the war at home. The F.B.I. has proved more effective in waging turf battles against Rudy Giuliani than waging war on terrorism. Of the more than 900 suspects arrested, exactly zero have been criminally charged in the World Trade Center attack (though one has died of natural causes, we're told, in a New Jersey jail cell). The Bush team didn't fully recognize that a second attack on America had begun until more than a week after the first casualty. The most highly trumpeted breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists -- Tom Ridge's announcement that ''the site where the letters were mailed'' had been found in New Jersey -- proved a dead end. And now the president is posing with elementary-school children again.
Given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with C.E.O. clockwork, perhaps it should be added to the growing list of Things That Have Changed Forever since Sept. 11. But let's not be so hasty. Not everything changes that fast -- least of all Washington. The White House's home-front failures are not sudden, unpredictable products of wartime confusion but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan. 20. 
This is an administration that will let its special interests -- particularly its high-rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the right -- have veto power over public safety, public health and economic prudence in war, it turns out, no less than in peacetime. When anthrax struck, the administration's first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as speedily as possible to protect Americans, but to protect the right of pharmaceutical companies to profiteer. The White House's faith in tax cuts as a panacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week's House ''stimulus'' package showering $254 million on Enron, the reeling Houston energy company (now under S.E.C. investigation) that has served as a Bush campaign cash machine. 
Airport security, which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since Sept. 11, is also held hostage by campaign cash: As Salon has reported, ServiceMaster, a supplier of the low-wage employees who ineptly man the gates, is another G.O.P. donor. Not that Republicans stand alone in putting fat cats first. In a display of bipartisanship, Democrats -- lobbied by Linda Hall Daschle, the Senate majority leader's wife -- joined the administration in handing the airlines a $15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in the salaries of the industry's C.E.O.'s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees. 
To see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security, you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation -- and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ridge. 
Mr. Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader -- a successful governor of a large state (Pennsylvania) who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam. A close friend of George W. Bush, he should have been in the administration from the get-go, and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs, including the vice presidency. But after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights, he got zilch. Instead of Mr. Ridge, the administration signed on the pro-life John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson -- who have brought us where we are today. 
The farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations -- though Mr. Thompson often comes across as a Chamber of Commerce glad-hander who doesn't know his pants are on fire, and Mr. Ashcroft often shakes as if he's not just seen great Caesar's ghost but perhaps John Mitchell's as well. Both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration. They've seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No. 1 concern. 
Pre-Sept. 11, Mr. Thompson, in defiance of science, heartily lent his credibility to the Bush administration's stem cell ''compromise'' by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers. Post-Sept. 11, he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat, also in defiance of science. Now he maintains that the $1.5 billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system -- almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals, not shoring up local hospitals -- is adequate for fighting bioterrorism. This, too, is in defiance of all expert estimates, including that of the one physician in the Senate, the Republican Bill Frist. 
It should also be on Mr. Thompson's conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government's house physician -- David Satcher, the surgeon general and a much-needed honest broker of public health -- locked away, presumably because Dr. Satcher, a Clinton appointee, became persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right. Only after Mr. Ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag. 
As for Mr. Ashcroft, he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons. Planned Parenthood, which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them, has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one. This was true not only before Sept. 11 but, says Ann Glazier, Planned Parenthood's director of security, remains true -- even though her organization, long targeted by such home-grown Talibans as the Army of God, has a decade's worth of leads on ''the convergence of international and domestic terrorism.'' 
Ms. Glazier found the sight of Mr. Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops offering a $1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy. ''Religious extremists don't respond to money,'' she points out. Such is the state of the F.B.I., she adds, that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days ''because we have so many here we're afraid we're going to lose it'' (perhaps among the Timothy McVeigh documents). 
If either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that, say, Mayor Giuliani does, there wouldn't have been a need to draft Mr. Ridge. Even so, he's mainly a P.R. gimmick -- a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights. As director of homeland security, he's allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agencies -- so far with roughly a dozen staff members. When asked to define Mr. Ridge's responsibilities, Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it was ''a very busy coordination job,'' but so far Mr. Ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion. 
The one specific duty that he has claimed -- in an interview with Tom Brokaw -- was that he'd be the one ''making the phone call'' to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers. That presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld, who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly codified days after Mr. Ridge's appointment. 
Since the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan, we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here -- even as Mr. Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Taliban, once expected to implode in days, are proving Viet-Cong-like in their intractability. The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that ''instead of a thankful Afghan population, popular support for the Taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the U.S. growing.'' 
Maybe we're losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because the Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a C.E.O. (from Madison Avenue) chosen not for her expertise in policy or politics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head & Shoulders shampoo. If we can't effectively fight anthrax, I guess it's reassuring to know we can always win the war on dandruff.

City - Enron directors cash in shares.
By Simon English.

The Daily Telegraph

(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001

LEADING executives at Enron, the troubled US energy giant, cashed in shares worth more than $100m ( #70m) this year in the run-up to a financial crunch that has left the company's credibility in ruins. 
Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay, chief executive, sold about 400,000 shares this year, netting him more than $25m. He still held 2.8m shares until July.
Other executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by July. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron declined to comment on the share sales. 
Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to ""dispel uncertainty in the financial community"" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enron's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep another $800,000 in cash. He said: ""We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community."" 
The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission into partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. 
Mr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to restore confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong. 
Enron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called ""failed investments"".

INDIA: Lenders to meet over Enron's Dabhol on Nov 3.

10/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Lenders to power plant in India majority owned by Enron Corp have called a meeting next week in London to discuss ways of reviving the beleaguered project, a banking source said on Saturday. 
They will examine offers that two Indian companies have put forward for buying the U.S. energy giant's 65 percent stake, and those of two other U.S. firms, in Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is building the controversial project, the source told Reuters.
The meeting of lenders, who include multinational banks such as Citibank and Bank of America , will be held on November 3, the source added. 
At stake is not just the fate of the $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which is India's largest foreign direct investment, but also the over $600 million investment of Enron, General Electric Co and Bechtel. 
All three companies are founders of DPC, which in 1995 got permission from India's Maharashtra state government to set up the plant on its coast. 
The plant's first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1999, but work on the second phase of 1,444 MW, which is 97 percent complete, was abruptly stopped in June this year following a blazing row with cash-strapped state utility MSEB. 
MSEB, which agreed in 1995 to take the plant's entire output, said it can no longer do so because Dabhol's power is too costly. 
Dabhol, in turn, accused MSEB of defaulting on its monthly payments and served a preliminary notice to terminate the power purchase contract. 
Under this notice, both companies are given six months time to settle the matter through negotiations. If talks fail, Dabhol has the right to issue a final termination notice and take the matter to arbitration in London. That six month period expires on November 19. 
Houston-based Enron, which owns 65 percent of Dabhol, further announced that it intends to exit the project and offered to sell its equity to the Indian government. 
TIME RUNNING OUT 
The Business Standard newspaper reported that next week's meeting would also discuss a request by Dabhol to finally terminate the contract after November 19. 
""It is one of the items on the agenda,"" the paper quoted a senior banker as saying. 
The paper said once Dabhol serves the final notice, the matter proceeds to arbitration, which would not help India. 
""The widespread view among the government and lenders is that in such a situation DPC will win hands down,"" the paper added. 
A Dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately. 
The source said the meeting would review the progress made in resolving the dispute so far. 
The Indian government has not responded to Enron's offer to buy its equity, but two Indian companies, BSES Ltd and Tata Power Ltd , have shown interest. 
They have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced, and if the founders agree to sell their stake at a discount. 
Local business daily, the Economic Times reported on Friday that Tata Power and BSES are willing to pay the founders $450-$600 million for the 85 percent stake held by Enron, GE and Bechtel. 
Enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less than $1 billion, the paper added. 
Officials of Tata Power and BSES were not immediately available for comment.

Enron sues Microsoft for breach of contract ; Move could block high-speed service

(Copyright 2001)

HOUSTON -- Enron has sued Microsoft, alleging it breached a contract for broadband services, in a move that could temporarily block the largest software company's MSN high-speed Internet service in some U.S. regions. 
Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company from providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron provides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in the 14 states -- including Washington -- where Qwest Communications International operates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.
Enron's lawsuit was filed Thursday, the same day Microsoft had planned to offer fast Internet access in 45 cities to give it access to potential customers in 29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner. 
""We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron, as quickly as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other providers,"" Visse said. 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing company policy on pending litigation. Enron, based in Houston, is the largest energy trader. 
Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide bandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow Jones news wire reported. 
Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of the deal, Dow reported. 
Alternative browser-users denied Microsoft entry 
NEW YORK -- Microsoft's premier Web portal, MSN.com, denied entry to millions of people who use alternative browser software such as Opera and told them to get Microsoft's products instead. 
The decision led to complaints from the small but loyal Opera community that Microsoft was abusing its status as the Internet's browser leader. Microsoft later backed off and said yesterday that it would support the other browsers after all. 
Browser products affected by the shutout, which was triggered by a face-lift of the MSN.com Web site, included Opera, Mozilla and Amaya, said Kevin Reichard, editorial manager for Internet.com's BrowserWatch site. 
Mike Pettit, president of ProComp, an anti-Microsoft group, urged state and federal investigators to look into the matter as part of its lawsuit accusing Microsoft of anti-competitive practices.

MicrosoftSF to shut down; Sony will run retail store 
SAN FRANCISCO -- Sony will take over a retail store it manages with Microsoft next month, when the biggest software maker's Xbox goes up against Sony's PlayStation 2 in a contest for control of the $20 billion video-game market, a Sony spokeswoman said. 
The two companies agreed to shut down MicrosoftSF, a retail outlet in Sony's San Francisco Metreon entertainment complex. It will be replaced with a Digital Solutions electronics store run by Sony on Thursday, Metreon spokeswoman Kirsten Maynard said. 
In April 1998, the companies said they would open the store that displays and sells Microsoft products alongside Sony electronics that run the software. In March 2000, Microsoft announced the Xbox, a game console with an advanced-graphics chip that goes on sale Nov. 15. 
""A lot has changed with both companies,"" Maynard said. ""It sort of became not-a-fit anymore."" 
Sony Metreon won't carry the Xbox or Game Cube, a new video console from Nintendo that goes on sale Nov. 19, she said. Officials at Microsoft couldn't be reached for comment on the shutdown.

Tom,

Attached are EOL customers between July 1, 2001 and Nov. 30, 2001, broken out by Physical and Financial...  The only physical customers I remember non EOL are Imperial Sugar and Texas Energy... I'm also checking this list against other non-EOL deals Eric or Joe might have done, but for now take a look at this... O

Ladies and Gentlemen:

There is a few things that I need to tell you and need from you:

1.  The 5th and 6th floor to ECS is now closed and restricted to anyone other than the workers so that our floor will be ready for us.  Please do not try and schedule any tours because they will not be allowed. 

2.  Only people who have been given access will be allowed from  3:00 PM to 6:00 PM on Sunday, which will be limited.  Please tell your guys that they will be turned away at the door if they try to come in.   The building will be opened at 5:00 AM on Monday morning for everyone to come in early and unpack and make sure their equipment is setup.  There will be techs on the floors by 5:00 AM, including move teams personnel and telephone help as well.
**** On this note, I can give access to the admins to come in on Sunday since you are  POC for your group and I can give access to either 1 or 2 people from your group as well to come in and test the machines.  Please make sure you gather everyone's password and logon name so that this can be done Sunday.  If anyone has any questions regarding this you can direct them to me.  Email me the names of who will be coming from your group today please.  If I don't have a name, then the employee will not be let in.


3.  Please make sure to pack your headsets and I will have someone there on Sunday to install Assts headsets only, everyone else will be installed on Monday morning.  If there is someone in your group that it is crucial to have a headset installed, please let me know.
4.  Make sure your groups know where they are located at on their map that is in their move packet.  Highlight it for them if needed.  If you need more copies, let me know.


 If there is anything you need help with or have a question on, please let me know.

Many thanks,

ONE MORE THING:

Please let everyone know that the tag is for their chair to move over.  We are not getting new chairs after all.  
Also, tell them to please leave their pink bag on their desk the day of the move.

Thanks

ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001         POSTPONED
This is a notification that the Enron Corp. I/T Networks team will be connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network.  While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.

Outage:  Upgrade for E10K SSP tremor requires downtime on server moe.
Environments Impacted:  Global
Purpose: An SSP is the controlling server for an E10K platform.  Moe is a domain on the E10K platform named aftershock.  In order to complete the upgrade of moe, we must first upgrade the SSP.  The first phase will entail upgrading the SSP to Solaris 8 and the SSP software.  
Backout: The SSP is really a new server that needs to be configured.  The old SSP will be there if we need to back out.

Enron Warns of Problems Eroding Profit

Enron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quarter earnings. 
The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said.
In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a ""demand obligation,"" on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note. 
""We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets,"" said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash. 
Enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake of a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet. 
The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
Yesterday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the company reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 million last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was widened to $664 million. 
Enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily final because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its review, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accounting practices.

Senior Wall Street bankers are concerned that Dynegy could walk away from its proposed $9.8bn ( #6.8bn) rescue bid for its rival energy group Enron - a move that would have severe repercussions for the energy trading sector and financial markets. 
In a series of interviews with the Financial Times, bankers expressed worries that while credit rating agencies had been assured that it was extremely difficult for Dynegy to pull out, some of the company's shareholders were under the impression that the ""material adverse change"" clause could be triggered.
""There is no way you can say that this deal is definitely going to happen, or even likely to happen,"" one banker said. ""And the knock on effects of it not going ahead are not good,"" he added. None of the bankers would agree to be publicly identified. 
The possibility of Dynegy dropping out of the deal was discussed when senior bankers from JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, which are advising Enron, met with officials from Moody's, the credit rating agencies, 10 days ago. 
The rating agency expressed concerns that it would be too easy for Dynegy to give up its bid, further undermining Enron's creditworthiness. 
Moody's decision to preserve Enron's investment grade rating was one of the main reasons why Dynegy was able to go ahead with its rescue bid. 
In justifying the all-stock bid, Chuck Watson, chairman of Dynegy, said last week that buying the company for a low price - a fraction of Enron's market capitalisation at its peak in 2000 - was a major protection against failure. 
But he admitted that much of the last round of negotiations with Moody's had been spent reassuring them that the material adverse change clauses in the merger agreement were not too loose. 
According to Dynegy, the material adverse change clauses relate to the outcome of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into Enron's finances, possible litigation against the energy company, balance sheet strength and earnings forecasts. www.ft.com/enron.

Enron drops earnings for 3rd quarter 
$690 million debt comes due for downgraded firm 
By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron Corp.'s financial well-being continues to be a moving target as the company made more adjustments to its earnings Monday. 
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Enron said it reduced third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by 1 cent to reflect recently discovered accounting errors. 
The company also said that its recent credit rating drop may force it to pay off a $690 million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt. 
The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. 
""We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation,"" said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
Enron's pending $690 million IOU is related to a limited partnership to buy natural gas assets in Brazil. One of the terms of the partnership requires Enron to repay the debt if its credit rating slips to BBB- on rating agency Standard & Poor's scale, which it did Nov. 12. If Enron doesn't put up collateral equal to the amount of the note or repay it, the other partners in the deal can sell off the partnership's assets. 
Enron officials said in the filing they are working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt. 
If Enron's debt rating continues to drop, which would put it below investment grade, the company would face another $3.9 billion in debt repayments, the company said in the filing, mainly by two other partnerships formed in recent years: $2.4 billion owed by Osprey Trust and $915 million by Marlin Water Trust. 
Enron is under a negative review by most rating agencies, but a cash infusion from Dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of investment banks and a possible $500 million to $1 billion equity investment by other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat. 
The turmoil around Enron's finances started after Oct. 16, when steep losses in its third-quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by the former chief financial officer with the approval of the company's board of directors. 
The LJM partnerships were formed using Enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company's new lines of business and were designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company's stock. 
The CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nearly $600 million. 
Those problems shook investor and trading partner confidence in Enron, which led to a sharp drop in its stock price and cuts in its credit rating. The company eventually reached a deal with rival Dynegy to be acquired for almost $9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $13 billion in debt and $2 billion in preferred stock. 
The fallout from Enron's crumble is spreading to its major service providers, including Andersen. That firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit, while on Monday Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., called for an investigation of Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron and Houston-based Waste Management. 
""The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting,"" Dingell wrote in a letter to the Public Oversight Board requesting the investigation. 
Andersen, based in Chicago, has a large Houston office and a strong foothold in the energy industry with clients, including Enron and Dynegy. Critics of Andersen have said the firm should have done more as Enron's auditor to draw investors' attention to the company's unusual finances. 
A lawsuit filed in Oregon alleged Andersen's judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it received from Enron while it was auditor. 
In June, Andersen was fined $7 million by the SEC to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of Waste Management, the largest civil penalty against a Big Five accounting firm. Andersen did not admit or deny the charges.

Enron Corp. warned in a regulatory filing that it could be forced to pay a $690-million debt by next week and reduced its already abysmal third-quarter earnings. 
The energy giant said a downgrading of its debt last week triggered a Monday deadline for it to repay or offer collateral against the $690 million owed to a party in one of its partnerships.
If the debt isn't paid, the partner could liquidate the partnership's assets, which include a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. 
Enron has already used up its $3-billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash. 
The company reduced its previously reported results for the third quarter by 3 cents a share, according to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That would put its loss at 87 cents a share.

A congressman has called for an investigation of Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc., according to a letter released Monday. 
Turning up the heat under the conflict-of-interest issue among the world's largest bean-counters, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) asked the Public Oversight Board for a ""review or special investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP,"" said the letter.
Dingell also asked the board to look into peer reviews of Arthur Andersen conducted in recent years by other accounting firms, including Deloitte & Touche, and questioned the value of a triennial peer review process in place since 1978. 
Arthur Andersen, based in Chicago, was auditor to Houston energy trading giant Enron, rocked in recent weeks by a Securities and Exchange Commission probe of outside partnership deals involving company officers. Enron's stock price has plunged, several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending.

U.S. Official Calls for Probe Of Andersen, 2 Problem Audits
By Judith Burns

The Wall Street Journal Europe

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
WASHINGTON -- Concerned about the accounting profession's ability to police itself, a senior House of Representatives Democrat has called for a ""special investigation"" of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc. 
In a letter to U.S. Public Oversight Board Chairman Charles Bowsher released Monday, Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, requested a review of Andersen's audits of Enron and Waste Management, two high-profile audit failures.
Enron, of Houston, which recently agreed to be acquired by crosstown rival Dynergy Inc., acknowledged it overstated net income by $586 million (662.5 million euros) and will need to restate financial reports dating back to 1997. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's treatment of investments in limited partnerships tied to former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
Enron's problems come on the heels of another audit debacle for Andersen. In June, the firm reached a $7 million settlement with the SEC in which it neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of Waste Management. 
Andersen and the waste hauler paid $220 million in 1999 to settle class-action lawsuits alleging massive accounting fraud that inflated Waste Management's reported earnings in the mid-1990s. 
In addition to the SEC's probe of its role in the Enron matter, Andersen is undergoing routine peer review by Deloitte & Touche. Dingell suggested that review may be clouded by the fact that Deloitte & Touche has been hired by outside lawyers representing a special committee of Enron's board of directors. 
Given the potential conflict of interest on the part of Deloitte & Touche, and Andersen's track record, ""there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in Andersen or the peer review process,"" Mr. Dingell wrote.

[Focus on Retirement, Pay and Getting Ahead] 
Passing Up
Some senior executives are spurning hefty severance packages. 
Last week, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay decided to forgo a $60.6 million severance payment that would have been triggered by Dynegy Inc.'s planned acquisition of the Houston energy trader. Enron initially said Mr. Lay would keep one-third of the planned payout and take it in shares of the combined company. He later decided against any severance payment after criticism by influential energy traders, who produce most of Enron's profits. 
""In this environment, we're seeing producers putting pressure on managers and managers putting pressure on producers to ensure that their pay is in line with their performance,"" says Ira Kay, executive-compensation practice leader of pay-and-benefits consultants Watson Wyatt Worldwide in New York. 
Alan Johnson, managing director of New York pay consultants Johnson Associates, says Mr. Lay's initial intention to accept a portion of his severance represents ""the continuing trend of executives being clueless."" 
(For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million from exercising Enron stock options, according to disclosure reports tracked by Thomson Financial.) 
Three top executives of US Airways Group Inc., including Chief Executive Rakesh Gangwal and Chairman Stephen Wolf, passed up severance after deciding to stay at the company when a planned merger fell through. The trio stood to gain $45 million for resigning as a result of severance agreements triggered by shareholder approval of its now-defunct merger accord with UAL Corp. At US Airways' Sept. 19 annual meeting, they said they would remain with the company. 
Firm Relationship 
New York law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft last week rolled out an unusual formal mentoring program for first-year associates. 
For two hours a month for at least a year, each associate will meet with a designated mentor -- typically a midlevel associate -- to discuss issues such as career development. If the relationship doesn't click, new pairings will be made. CWT hires about 50 law-school graduates a year. 
Jordan Schwartz, the firm's hiring partner, says the initiative was sparked by a 2000 survey of midlevel associates at 165 U.S. law firms conducted by American Lawyer magazine. The poll, which assesses how associates perceive they are being treated, ranked the firm last. ""It wasn't an accurate reflection of the firm,"" he says. ""But it was a wake-up call."" 
So, CWT created an ""associate task force"" that identified key issues and explored ways to improve the quality of work life. The mentoring program was one result. 
Hiring Blitz 
Despite rising joblessness, a few employers are hiring in a big way. 
ZipRealty Inc., an online real-estate broker in Richmond, Calif., recently announced plans to hire 1,000 real-estate agents within the next 18 months. It has about 135 agents, all of whom work from home. 
""We have large consumer demands right now, so we want to make sure we have great realtors,"" says Scott Kucirek, executive vice president of people and culture. 
Since August, zipRealty has hired nearly 30 agents a month for all its 12 markets, which include Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego and Chicago. The company has three full-time recruiters sending e-mails and making calls to market its recruitment effort. Its database contains 200 to 300 prospects. 
The job, which usually pays only commission, offers some perks. The company will pay new agents $1,500 a month for three months to give them time to make connections and sell a home. After that, pay will be entirely commission based. New hires also receive cellphone and car allowances.

In New Filing, Enron Reports Debt Squeeze
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and FLOYD NORRIS

11/20/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company
The Enron Corporation told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash. It said that if any of a number of things went wrong, its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question. 
In a delayed quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said that it would have to repay $690 million in debt by next Tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan.
Enron has about $1.75 billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of $9.15 billion by the end of next year. The report for the third quarter, which was filed five days late, says the company faces immediate demand for $3.9 billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further. 
Enron's independent auditors with the firm of Arthur Andersen have not been able to complete their review of Enron's financial statements for the third quarter. Andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of Enron's books related to Enron's disclosure this month that it had overstated almost $600 million in profits in the last five years. Enron has said that it will restate statements that Andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon. 
Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night. 
Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, has agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., its smaller crosstown rival in Houston, and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further downgrading of Enron, which is now at the lowest investment-grade rating. Any downgrades could lead to a collapse of Enron's core energy trading business, analysts say, as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with Enron entirely. 
The Dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year, and the disclosures yesterday indicate that Enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then, particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed. Enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next September. 
Enron is in talks to obtain $500 million to $1 billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions. In addition, executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell $800 million in assets by the end of the year, and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year. Enron is also set to receive a $1 billion infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, if the deal closes next year. 
Still, even after factoring in cash flow from Enron's core energy-trading operations, Enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year -- meaning that Enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities. 
Carol Coale, an analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston, said the new disclosures indicated that Enron's troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed, even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with Dynegy was announced. 
''Our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank,'' Ms. Coale said. ''But now it sounds like Enron's problems were actually more inherent than perceived.'' 
Enron's deal with Dynegy calls for Enron holders to receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share, but in trading since the deal was announced Enron's share price has lagged Dynegy's price, reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms. 
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, before the Enron filing was released, Enron rose 6 cents, to $9.06, and Dynegy rose $1.13, to $43.60. At those prices, the value of the Dynegy offer is 29.2 percent above Enron's share price, compared with a 20.6 percent difference when the deal was announced. 
Some debts that Enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares, but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further. And the merger agreement with Dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if Enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger -- currently $11.71 an Enron share. 
In after-hours trading yesterday, after the release of the Enron filing, the share price slipped to $9. 
Enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than $500 million. Yesterday's filing provided some additional details on Enron's relationships with various related partnerships whose debts Enron could be forced to pay, and it said that additional write-offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined. It said that because Enron's stock value had fallen, one write-down could be $700 million. 
The disclosures show that Enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet. 
But the collapse of Enron's stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost Enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts. 
''It is not possible to predict,'' Enron warned investors, whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful. ''An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern.''

Decision to locate ConocoPhillips in Houston enhances world's energy capital
By PAM EASTON
Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires

HOUSTON (AP) - The decision to base the oil giant created by the combination of Phillips Petroleum Co. and Conoco Inc. in Houston, home of the smaller Conoco, helps cement the city's status as the nation's energy capital. 
""Houston already was the energy capital of the world. This just proves it,"" said Mark Baxter, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
""All the major players are in Houston and Houston can accommodate the employee growth base,"" he said. ""It is easier to conduct the business in the Houston market because not only are all the major companies there, all the support is in Houston as well."" 
The dlrs 15.6 billion deal announced Sunday that would create the nation's third largest oil producer may mean more prestige for Houston, even though the nation's two largest oil companies - Irving-based ExxonMobil and San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco - have their headquarters located elsewhere, each has thousands of employees working in the nation's fourth-largest city. 
It all began with the 1901 Spindletop strike in southeast Texas when oilmen discovered that much of the continental United States' vast oil resources lay beneath Texas soil. 
""Historically oil and gas centers sprang up adjacent to oil and gas discoveries,"" said David Bole, the vice president of Randall & Dewey, Inc., a Houston-based oil consulting firm. ""But certainly with high-speed communications developed over the last 30 years, the decision making has been centralized more in the financial centers. 
""What has set Houston apart from many other emerging oil centers was the caliber of the early wildcatters, their vision and their ability to build mega-companies. In many cases it is their legacy that has built Houston into today's oil capital."" 
Shell Oil Co. is based in Houston alongside several other producers and numerous offshore drilling, oil field services, pipeline, oil field firefighting and related companies. 
In recent years, the city also has become home to large energy trading firms such as Dynegy, Inc., Enron Corp., Reliant Inc. and others. Together, they operate dozens of computerized energy trading floors scattered throughout the city. 
""Consolidation is cumulative - a self-fulfilling process of centralizing all the important pieces of the oil industry in one place,"" Bill Gilmer, an economist in Houston for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, wrote in a recent publication. ""The same principles, of course, are what draw moviemakers to Hollywood, financial service providers to New York and automakers to Detroit."" 
And, it seems, energy companies to Houston.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Energy deal savings set to increase.
By ANDREW HILL.

Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved
ChevronTexaco yesterday increased the annual savings it expected to achieve from the merger between the two oil groups to $1.8bn by March 2003. 
David O'Reilly, chief executive, told analysts that the combined company would also meet its original synergy target of $1.2bn within six to nine months of the deal, which was completed last month.
Mr O'Reilly also said it expected oil and gas production to grow at an annual rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent over the next five years, and dismissed worries about the falling oil price. 
""Our business is used to swings and volatility - if you want a stable price environment you don't want to be in this business,"" he told reporters after addressing analysts in New York. 
Mr O'Reilly said the news of the latest big merger in the industry - the $35bn deal between Conoco and Phillips Petroleum - only made him more confident that the ChevronTexaco deal was right. 
ChevronTexaco now claims to be the third-largest energy company in terms of global oil reserves and the fourth-largest in global oil and natural gas production. He said the synergies translated into gains of about $1 per share after tax. 
ChevronTexaco has an important role in Dynegy's rescue bid for Enron, the rival energy group. ChevronTexaco has a 26 per cent stake in Dynegy and immediately invested $1.5bn in convertible preferred shares of Dynegy to fund its direct equity infusion in Enron. ChevronTexaco is committed to buying a further $1bn of Dynegy common stock once Dynegy completes its takeover. If the deal fails, ChevronTexaco can redeem the convertible preferred shares for $1.5bn in cash or convert to common shares, giving it a 36 per cent stake in equity. 
Mr O'Reilly said yesterday the group was committed to the deal, despite worries about potential hidden liabilities at Enron. 
ChevronTexaco is doing its own review of potential litigation risks at Enron, and Mr O'Reilly said there was ""a full suite of due diligence"" that needed to be done on other issues at Enron. 
* Enron's lenders welcomed the energy company's openness yesterday following a meeting in New York. Greg Whalley, Enron's president, led the meeting, which was postponed when Dynegy began talks with Enron two weeks ago. 
""Much of senior management was there and they were doing a good job,"" said one. Another banker said Enron management had been ""pretty upfront"" about the problems at the company, although he said most lenders were reluctant to air their concerns in full at the crowded meeting.

Enron restates Q3 to deeper loss; toils to restructure $690M payment
AP

HOUSTON (AP) _ As embattled Enron Corp. examines its books, the energy trader restated its third-quarter results Monday, increasing its loss for the period by three cents a share to 87 cents. 
The company also disclosed it is trying to restructure a $690-million obligation that could come due Nov. 27.
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended. 
``We are working with the lenders to restructure or extend the term on the obligation,'' he said. 
Palmer said that when Enron's credit rating was reduced it triggered a clause in one of the ``limited partnership agreements that could cause that $690 million obligation to become due beginning next week.'' 
Houston-based Enron, being purchased by rival Dynegy Inc. to escape a spate of problems and shattered Wall Street confidence, also increased nine-month earnings by a penny to 20 cents a share. 
Dynegy is purchasing the company for $7.8 billion in stock. 
In an SEC filing Nov. 8, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ``should not be relied upon'' and that outside businesses run by Enron officials during that period should have been included in the company's earnings reports. 
That would have reduced Enron's profits for those years by $586 million, from $2.89 billion to $2.31 billion. 
In addition, the company revised its debt upward in each year from 1997 to 2000; at the end of 2000, Enron's debt was $10.86 billion, or $628 million more than previously reported. 
By not disclosing the debt earlier, Enron presumably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations _ trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets. 
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
In the filing, Enron reiterated it is developing a plan to exit $8 billion in non-core businesses that are performing ``below acceptable rates,'' and expects to use the proceeds to repay debt.

Enron restates third-quarter earnings

HOUSTON (AP) - As embattled Enron Corp. examines its books, the energy trader restated its third-quarter earnings, increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a share to 87 cents. 
The company also disclosed it is trying to restructure a dlrs 690 million obligation that could come due Nov. 27.
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended. 
""We are working with the lenders to restructure or extend the term on the obligation,"" he said. 
Palmer said the obligation could come due because of Enron's lowered credit rating. When the rating was reduced, it triggered a clause in one of the ""limited partnership agreements that could cause that dlrs 690 million obligation to become due beginning next week."" 
Houston-based Enron, which is being purchased by rival Dynegy Inc. to escape a recent spate of problems and shattered Wall Street confidence, also increased nine-month earnings by a cent to 20 cents a share. 
Dynegy is purchasing the company for dlrs 7.8 billion in stock. 
In an SEC filing Nov. 8, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ""should not be relied upon"" and that outside businesses run by Enron officials during that period should have been included in the company's earnings reports. 
That would have reduced Enron's profits for those years by dlrs 586 million, from dlrs 2.89 billion to dlrs 2.31 billion. In addition, the company revised its debt upward in each year from 1997-2000; at the end of 2000, Enron's debt was dlrs 10.86 billion, dlrs 628 million more than previously reported. 
By not disclosing the debt earlier, Enron presumbably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations - trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets. 
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
""We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation,"" said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of the special committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
The merger is expected to go through by next summer. Dynegy, backed by major investor ChevronTexaco Inc., will also assume dlrs 13 billion of Enron debt. 
Enron agreed to be bought after its stock price plunged about 80 percent in the weeks after it disclosed a third quarter loss followed by an acknowledgment that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating partnerships run by company officials. 
The partnerships led to a dlrs 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity and allowed Enron to keep about half a billion dollars in debt off its books. 
Credit services also have diminished Enron's long-term debt to just above junk grade. 
In the filing, Enron also reiterated it is developing a plan to exit dlrs 8 billion in non-core businesses that are performing ""below acceptable rates,"" and should be able to use the proceeds to repay debt. 
Shares of Enron were up 6 cents to dlrs 9.06 in trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron announced its latest filing after the market close.

USA: Enron sounds debt alarm, reduces reported earnings.
By C. Bryson Hull

11/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Humbled energy giant Enron Corp. on Monday warned that it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt by next week and reduced its already-abysmal third-quarter earnings. 
The Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on Monday with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Among the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week. That marked the start of a nine-day period that expires on Nov. 26, during which Enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships. 
If not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. 
The company is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat. 
Enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share. The move reflects adjustments made after the quarter's end, Enron said. 
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001. On Nov 8, Enron said it had restated earnings for 1997-2000 and that net income for the four-year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported. 
It also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust. 
Such an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and ""would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" the company wrote. 
Enron had released those figures earlier, but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability. 
CREDIT COULD BE A KILLER 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for Enron to ""Baa3"" and ""BBB-minus,"" just one notch above ""junk"" status. Each warned it may cut its respective ratings again. Moody's also cut Enron's short-term debt rating, which affects commercial paper, to ""Not Prime,"" a junk rating. 
In nearly all of its partnership deals, Enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue Enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels. At the close of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were at $9.06 - well below the trigger prices. 
All of the partnerships, which Enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet, have become the once-proud company's bane. The SEC is investigating potential conflict-of-interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow served as general partner. 
Enron had to extract itself from those partnerships, which led to a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity. 
The revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory, leaving Enron to be bought on Nov. 9 by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. for the fire-sale price of $9 billion in stock. 
In an unusual note, Enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant, per SEC regulations, because of ""the need of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditors, to complete their review procedures."" 
Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion.

Enron Warns That Raft of Problems May Hurt Its Fourth-Quarter Profit

11/19/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Enron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quarter earnings, Tuesday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron (ENE) stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said.
In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a ""demand obligation,"" on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note. 
""We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets,"" said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash. 
Enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake of a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet. 
The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
Monday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the company reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 million last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was widened to $664 million. 
Enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily final because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its review, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accounting practices.

Enron Files 10-Q For 3Q With SEC

11/19/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) filed its Form 10-Q for the third quarter and said its previously reported third quarter loss of 84 cents a share was widened by 3 cents to reflect adjustments made subsequent to the end of the quarter. 
As reported, Enron was restating financial statements from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001 due to questions over its finances.
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $618 million on revenue of $47.6 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30. 
In a press release Monday, the company said its earnings of 19 cents a share for the nine-month period of 2001 were increased by 1 cent a share. 

Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures. 
In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits. 
According to the company's Form 10-Q, the special committee's investigation may identify additional or different information concerning these matters, which would require additional or different restatements. 

Dow Jones Corporate Filings Alert reported Monday that Enron is currently preparing a restructuring plan aimed at taking aggressive steps to rationalize the company's existing cost structure, accelerating the process of divesting non-core businesses and assets and restructuring scheduled maturities of debt and other obligations. 
Enron said it is unable to estimate the timing of restructuring or the financial impact, but said fourth quarter results of operations will likely be hurt by employee severance, restructuring and other charges, according to Corporate Filings Alert. 
The company had $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at Sept. 30. 
On Nov. 9, Enron and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) signed a definitive merger agreement that would give Enron shareholders 0.2685 share of a Dynegy share. The merger is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2002.

Fears Mount Over Enron/Dynasty Deal
Bruce Francis, Kathleen Hays

11/19/2001
CNNfn: Markets Impact
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.
KATHLEEN HAYS, CNNFN ANCHOR, MARKETS IMPACT: There are mounting fears about the fate of the Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) /Dynegy (URL: http://www.dynegy.com/) deal. Financial Times once again has a scoop. Robert Thomson is the U.S. Managing Editor of the FT joining us now with details. Robert what`s going on I thought this was suppose to be a done deal? 
ROBERT THOMSON, FINANCIAL TIMES, U.S. MANAGING EDITOR: Well that`s right Kathleen but the interesting thing that make it perhaps not so done a deal is what we might call the materially adverse clause. That there is a change in the conditions surrounding Enron that makes (INAUDIBLE) a downgrade of them possible and really leaves the financial institutions exposed to them. And these financial institutions in conversations interviews with the Financial Times are telling us that they have deeper fears about this materially adverse clause being enacted than people out there now realize.
HAYS: Well I must say I think this is very interesting and I`m surprised not that I`m an expert on the deal or even close to the deal itself but it seemed that part of the way that Enron was getting the deal done with Dynegy was to say look we dug up all the possible problems all the maybe kind of hidden not so great deals that are being investigated now and supposedly everything was on the table. So what, what do you think? What are you hearing that they`re finding now that makes things look worst than they already look? 
THOMSON: Well really that`s the issue. To be quite honest we don`t know but who would have known a month ago and particularly three months ago that Enron is in this situation that it`s now in and how far those problems stretch is really the issue that (INAUDIBLE) surrounding Enron still have it and that they suspect that Dynegy might have it. It looks quite more (INAUDIBLE) the deal. Now Dynegy is saying but we`re going ahead with this yes there is that clause there, yes it covers us in case we find something that we don`t like the look of or like the smell of depending on what it maybe but we don`t` feel it will have to activate it. But of course on the other hand they are going to say that but they do have that fall back clause if they need it. 
HAYS: Go ahead Robert I`m sorry. 
THOMSON: So, but the truth is you know the full extent of Enron`s exposure to various businesses really is hidden by the complexity of the transaction`s the company was engaging in markets where frankly very few people know a lot about it. 
HAYS: What happens if the deal falls through? What happen to Enron? 
THOMSON: Well there`s a real issue there that a downgrade may follow and this there`s certainly concern in the banking community. Again, that the level of exposure in counter party risk and so on to Enron isn`t fully comprehended and frankly that`s why they spoke to the Financial Times because they thought well there`s an impression that this is a done deal, that the Enron problem is solved. They`re saying actually not so. 
HAYS: Wow. Well I think we have just enough time to take a look at you`re you got us something in China again. You take us to that world part of the world frequently what`s going on there. 
THOMSON: Yeah we Beijing (INAUDIBLE) here. Essentially the IFC the International Finance Corporation arm of the World Bank is taking a large stake in Chinese Bank in Nanjing (ph). That is amazing really. It`s by far the largest stake, $27 million, 15 percent in the Nanjing(ph) City Bank and it`s really we here are going to be the first of three big investments in Chinese banks over the next year or so. There are two small ones there already where people have taken 3, 5 percent in Chinese banks but for the first time International institutions are in a position where they can think about Chinese retail banking in a serious way. 
HAYS: OK Robert well thank you very much I guess that`s something for investors to watch. Particularly people who are global investors.

Enron Reduces Earnings, Warns $690 Mln Payment Due (Update2)
2001-11-19 22:03 (New York)

Enron Reduces Earnings, Warns $690 Mln Payment Due (Update2)

     (Adds in first paragraph that note payment may come next
week.)

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which agreed to
a takeover by Dynegy Inc. after a financial crisis threatened it
with bankruptcy, revised third-quarter earnings for the second
time this month and said it may have to make early payment of a
$690 million note next week.

     The Houston-based company lowered results by 3 cents a share,
bringing its third-quarter loss to 87 cents, or $664 million,
according to a Securities & Exchange Commission filing.
Liabilities from an affiliated partnership may reduce fourth-
quarter earnings by $700 million before taxes, Enron said.

     The disclosures don't indicate that Enron is in much worse
shape than on Nov. 8, said John Olson, an energy analyst at
Sanders Morris Harris. That's when Enron lowered its earnings back
to 1997 by $586 million, reflecting losses by affiliated
partnerships that it had wrongly kept off the books.

     ``I don't think anyone would be particularly surprised that
they had to adjust third-quarter earnings (again) considering they
restated earnings for the last four years,'' said Olson, who
doesn't own shares of Dynegy or Enron. ``I don't think it's a
problem.''

     Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing partnership may cut
Enron's fourth-quarter earnings. Enron is obligated to back
Whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock. Because
Enron's stock has plunged, it may have to write down its assets by
$700 million, the filing said.

                       Partnership Problems

     Enron said that the Dynegy buyout could collapse if Enron is
forced to pay judgments of more than $2 billion to settle lawsuits
over its dealings with affiliated partnerships. Dynegy has said it
can cancel the transaction if Enron's litigation costs and other
liabilities grow to $3.5 billion or more. Enron faces at least 23
such lawsuits.

     Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and
take debt off its books. Its shares plunged by 89 percent this
year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were
being used to hide losses from failed investments.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said earlier this month
that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost
Enron shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity. The company wrote
off $1.01 billion in investments in water, telecommunications and
retail-energy sales in the third quarter.

     A drop in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-'' by
Standard & Poor's on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off the $690
million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee
the debt taken on by another affiliated partnership, the company
said.

                        Brazilian Liability

     Without repayment or collateral, investors in a partnership
that owns Brazilian natural-gas assets can begin to liquidate the
partnership's assets, Enron said. Enron said it's working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.

     ``If we can't talk lenders into refinancing, there is the
possibility that . . . note would be due next week,'' said Karen
Denne, an Enron spokeswoman.

     As of Friday, the company had $1.3 billion in cash on hand.
It expects to close on $450 million in additional financing
tomorrow, and to complete $800 million in asset sales by the end
of the year. It's also trying to find investors who will put $500
million to $1 billion into the company.

     The company has raised cash in recent weeks by using its
pipelines as collateral. It received $1.5 billion from
ChevronTexaco last week as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In
return, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights in an
Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. Dynegy can
acquire the pipeline even if the merger falls through.

     Enron closed on a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. on Wednesday that was secured
with assets of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline Co. It expects to
close on another $450 million loan, secured with other Northern
Natural Gas assets, this week, Denne said. The commitment for the
loans was announced Nov. 1.


                      $3.9 Billion Liability

     The company also has huge liabilities that could push it into
financial crisis before the merger closes. A further drop in its
debt rating, which would put it below investment grade, would
trigger repayment of $3.9 billion in debt owed by two other
affiliated companies, Enron said.

     The rating drop would force it to repay $2.4 billion in debt
owed by Osprey Trust, and $915 million in debt taken on by Marlin
Water Trust, the company said in the filing.

     Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor, didn't grant final
approval of its financial statements in the filing because of an
internal investigation of its dealings with affiliated
partnerships, Enron said. The SEC is also investigating the
partnerships, which were run by Enron executives.

     The filing was released after the stock market closed. Shares
of Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06. Dynegy rose $1.13 to $43.60.
ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy and is
providing $2.5 billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout, fell
54 cents to $82.91.


ChevronTexaco Sees Investor Suits as Threat to Enron (Update1)
2001-11-19 19:53 (New York)

ChevronTexaco Sees Investor Suits as Threat to Enron (Update1)

     (Updates with Enron reducing third-quarter results in last
paragraph.)

     New York, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s exposure to
investor lawsuits is the biggest hurdle in its proposed buyout by
Dynegy Inc., said David O'Reilly, chief executive officer of
ChevronTexaco Inc., which is helping to back Dynegy's purchase.

     ChevronTexaco is ``paying particular attention to the
litigation risk,'' though ``we still think it's a good deal for
Dynegy and an even better deal for ChevronTexaco,'' Reilly said at
an analyst meeting in New York.

     ChevronTexaco, the second-biggest U.S. oil company, owns 27
percent of Dynegy. It agreed to provide Dynegy $2.5 billion as
part of the Enron purchase. Dynegy can cancel the bid if Enron's
legal liabilities, including investor suits, exceed $3.5 billion.
Enron said today in a regulatory filing it can't calculate the
cost of shareholder suits.

     Dynegy agreed 10 days ago to buy rival Enron, the largest
energy trader, for stock and debt now valued at $20.7 billion.
Enron's stock had plunged in recent weeks because of concerns it
was using affiliated partnerships to mask losses and hide debt.

     Gold Bennett Cera & Sidner LLP filed a class action suit in
Houston today alleging Enron misrepresented its business and
results. Other investors have filed similar suits.

     ChevronTexaco will have a clearer picture of the legal risks
in the next few months, O'Reilly said. ``There is no transaction
that is risk free,'' he said.

     Shares of Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06 today. They have
tumbled 89 percent this year. Dynegy gained $1.13 to $43.60. The
stock has declined 22 percent this year. Both companies are based
in Houston.

     ChenvronTexaco, based in San Francisco, fell 54 cents to
$82.91.

     Earlier this month, Enron reduced its earnings in the past
four years by $552 million because of accounting errors involving
affiliates. Enron ousted its chief financial officer, and it fired
its treasurer and a company attorney for making improper
investments in one of the affiliates.

     Enron reduced third-quarter earnings for a second time and
said it may have to make early payment on a $690 million note
this month, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.




Enron Says It May Have to Pay Off $690 Mln Note Next Week
2001-11-19 18:16 (New York)

Enron Says It May Have to Pay Off $690 Mln Note Next Week

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron said a drop in its
credit rating may force it to pay off a $690 million note by Nov.
27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt.

     Repayment was triggered by the Nov. 12 downgrade in Enron's
senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- by Standard & Poor's, the
company said in a securities filing.

     Enron must post collateral equal to the amount of the note or
repay it, the Securities and Exchange Commission filing said.

    Without repayment, partners in a Limited Partnership that owns
natural gas assets in Brazil can immediately begin to liquidate
the partnership's assets, Enron said. Enron said it's working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.

     A further drop in its debt rating, which would put it below
investment grade, would trigger repayment of $3.9 billion in debt
owed by two affiliated companies.

     The rating drop would trigger repayment of $2.4 billion in
debt owed by Osprey Trust, and $915 million owed by Marlin Water
Trust, the company said in the filing.

     Enron is being bought by Dynegy Inc. for $25 billion in stock
and debt. Enron also said in its filing that if shareholder
lawsuits result in judgments totaling more than $2 billion, the
Dynegy deal could collapse.

    The filing was released after the stock market closed.  Shares
of Houston-based Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06. Dynegy shares rose
$1.13 to $43.60. Shares of ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26
percent of Dynegy, fell 54 cents to $82.91.



Enron's Azurix May Have to Sell Assets If It Can't Borrow
2001-11-19 14:35 (New York)

Enron's Azurix May Have to Sell Assets If It Can't Borrow

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Azurix Corp., Enron Corp.'s
water unit, may have to sell assets if it can't find financing to
continue operations, the company said in a regulatory filing.

     Enron took Azurix public in June 1999 and then, after the
water company's stock plunged, took it private and paid off
investors in March.

     Azurix isn't sure it will be able to renew or refinance about
$113.3 million in long-term debt, including bank loans, that
matures before Sept. 30 at a ``reasonable'' cost, it said in a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
company also had $326.3 million in short-term debt as of Sept. 30.

     The loans are Azurix's ``primary sources of liquidity,'' the
filing said. If the company can't raise the funds, it might have
to use the proceeds from planned asset sales to refinance debt and
get cash, the filing said.

     If those asset sales don't generate enough money, ``Azurix
may need to sell other assets, which could result in Azurix
incurring losses in future periods,'' the company said.

     Azurix, though it still must file with the SEC, no longer
trades as a separate stock. The shares of Houston-based Enron fell
8 cents to $8.92 in early afternoon trading.

     Enron agreed earlier this month to be acquired by rival
Dynegy Inc. in a transaction currently valued at $24.9 billion.
The buyout came after Enron's shares plunged amid an SEC
investigation of the company's dealings with affiliated
partnerships.



U.S.'s Dingell Seeks Probe of Arthur Andersen, Dow Jones Says
2001-11-19 15:24 (New York)


     Washington, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Representative John
Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, has requested a special
investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP's audits of Enron Corp. and
Waste Management Inc., Dow Jones Newswires reported.

     Dingell sent a letter to Public Oversight Board Chairman
Charles Bowsher asking for the review, the newswire said.

      Andersen, the world's fifth largest accounting firm, served
as Enron's outside auditor for more than a decade, assuring
investors the company's financial statements conformed with
generally accepted accounting principles. Earlier this month, the
company reported that it overstated earnings by $586 million over
four-and-a-half years, inflated shareholder equity by $1.2 billion
because of an ``accounting error,'' and failed to consolidate
results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet.

     In June, Andersen reached a $7 million settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in which it neither admitted
nor denied allegations of fraud related to its audit of Waste
Management, Inc. Andersen is now undergoing a peer review by
Deloitte & Touche, Dow Jones said.


ENRON RESTATES Q3 RESULTS
From CBS.MarketWatch.com

By Leticia Williams

8:35 PM ET Nov 19, 2001

WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) - Embattled Enron Corp. restated its third-quarter
earnings Monday,  increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a share
to 87 cents, according to an SEC filing.

Houston-based Enron (ENE), which is being purchased by rival Dynegy to
escape a recent spate of problems and shattered Wall Street  confidence,
also increased nine-month earnings by a penny to 20  cents a share.

Dynegy (DYN) is purchasing the company for $7.8 billion in stock.

Enron must also pay off or refinance $690 million in debt obligations
by Nov. 26 or risk triggering nearly $4 billion in additional payments,
according to the SEC filing.

If the company doesn't make the payment on that date, the investors
have the right to immediately begin to liquidate the assets of a certain
limited partnership for an amount equal to the note payable.

In addition, Enron may sell the limited partnership's assets for
amounts below their carrying values.

""The net proceeds from the sale of such assets can be used to repay
Enron's obligation, "" according to the company's 10Q filed Monday with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Enron is in talks with lenders to ""develop a mutually acceptable""
amendment or waiver to avoid having to issue payment on the $690 million
note.

If the company fails to make the payment or if its credit rating falls
below investment grade, it will be forced to pay off or refinance up to
an additional $3.9 billion, the company said.

Standard &amp; Poor's currently has the company rated at BBB-, a notch
above speculative grade. Fitch rates the company's credit at BBB-,
evolving. Moody's Investor services rates the company Baa3, under
review. All ratings apply to the senior unsecured debt of the
corporation.

A note trigger would force the company to repay, refinance or cash
collaterize certain facilities in the amount of $3.9 billion, which
primarily consists of $2.4 billion in Osprey Trust and $915 million in
Marlin Water Trust, Enron said in the filing.

The company's (ENE) shares gained 6 cents to close at $9.06.

Company officials didn't immediately reply to questions about where it
would raise the money, since it's effectively barred from the capital
markets.

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

There will be a ticker with the same information all week , next week on EnronOnline.
The modified version of the GTC will be available on EnronOnline all week, next week for any customers wishing to have their legal departments review it before they accept it.

"New Reporting Contact for Natural Gas Teams","Hello everyone!
Just wanted to send a quick note to let those of you who don't know already that I will be moving into a new position within the next week or so and will no longer be the Reporting Contact for the Natural Gas Teams.  I am moving over to manage the Reporting Groups for the Back Office and Group Teams.  Please welcome Laynie East as my replacement.  She can be reached at X3-3131 and you may begin calling her with any Natural Gas Team related needs immediately.
I will certainly be assisting in the transition process and will assist her with any of your requests on an as needed basis for a while.  Please forward this note to anyone in your groups who may need this information.

It has been a pleasure working with each of you over the last several months.

Thanks,

"Enron Center South (ECS) Move Back-up Plan","


A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

The Enron Chain Saw Massacre 
Dan Ackman, Forbes.com, 01.11.02, 8:16 AM ET 

The Enron scandal is becoming more and more like a horror movie: It's not what's on screen that scares you, it's the unseen monster in the dark. 

Yesterday, Enron's accountants and the presidential Cabinet officers added to the scare and sent the burgeoning scandal in new directions. 

Arthur Andersen, the esteemed accounting firm, admitted it had destroyed Enron documents. That's bad, but what Arthur Andersen says it doesn't know may be worse. It says the records included ""a significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence."" 

The firm goes on to say, ""After receiving [an] SEC subpoena, the firm issued an instruction to preserve documents."" What, one wonders, was Andersen's ""instruction"" before it received the subpoena--to destroy Enron documents with abandon? Did the accountants comply with the directive to preserve the documents? Andersen doesn't know: ""At this time, we have not been able to determine whether that instruction was violated,"" the firm says in a statement. 

Andersen says it has ""also asked former U.S. Sen. John Danforth to conduct an immediate and comprehensive review of Andersen's records management policy and to recommend improvements."" It does not say how much it is paying Danforth for his counsel, but it can have this policy tip for nothing: Don't destroy documents related to a scandal that led to a bankruptcy that wiped out $70 billion in shareholder value. 

These unanswered questions are part of a pattern with Enron. No one really knows how it got so rich, or what it was doing with the many private partnerships managed by its executives. No one knows what prompted former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling to quit the company in August 2001. Indeed, at a bankruptcy court hearing earlier this week, it was revealed that Enron does not know the location of 79 of its top executives or even if they still work for the company. 

Separately, the White House revealed that Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans to warn them of the company's looming bankruptcy. This disclosure came with an additional announcement that Attorney General John Ashcroft has recused himself from the criminal investigation of Enron because of contributions he's received from company executives. 

Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said Lay telephoned O'Neill amid Enron's collapse ""to advise him about his concern about the obligations of Enron and whether they would be able to meet those obligations.'' Lay added that Enron ""was heading to bankruptcy,'' Fleischer said. 

O'Neill received calls from Lay on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8, said Treasury Spokeswoman Michele Davis. By then, Enron made its stunning disclosure of a $638 million third-quarter loss. Still, as of Oct. 28, Enron was still trading at over $15 per share. 

In a separate phone call to Don Evans, Lay similarly worried about the default on its bank and bond debt. He ""was having problems with his bond rating and he was worried about its impact on the energy sector,'' Fleischer said. 

Fleischer did not say what Evans or O'Neill told Lay, but they spoke to each other ""and they both agreed no action should be taken to intervene with their bond holders,'' and indeed no action was taken. The spokesman had said earlier he did not know of anyone in the White House who discussed Enron's financial situation. Did he even ask--or was not knowing the better option? 

Ashcroft stepped aside from the criminal investigation of Enron because he received campaign contributions from Enron executives during his campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2000. In addition to contributing to Ashcroft's senatorial campaign, Lay also gave $25,000 to a leadership committee headed by then-senator Ashcroft, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Enron, Lay and other executives have also been major contributors to President George Bush, both during his 2000 presidential campaign and during his runs for the Texas statehouse. Prior to Lay's contacts with O'Neill and Evans, Enron officials had extensive contact with Vice President Dick Cheney and his aides, when they worked together on a response to a much ballyhooed but quickly deflated energy crisis <http://forbes.com/2001/05/02/0502nocrisis.html> in the spring of 2001. 

Trying to insulate himself from the scandal, President Bush has ordered a review headed by O'Neill of U.S. pension and corporate disclosure rules. That review is intended, the administration says, to avoid a repeat of the energy-trading firm's collapse, in which thousands of employees lost most or all of their life savings. But Fleischer dismissed suggestions that the Justice Department investigation announced earlier this week should give way to a probe by an independent counsel. 

The president, for his part, saw Lay at a Houston charity event last spring at the White House with other business leaders last year. But he said he never discussed Enron's finances. ""I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company,"" 

Bush said yesterday. ""I have not met with him personally."" That's good: The last thing you want to do in a horror movie is meet with the villain alone. 


USA: NYSE says Enron trading halt to continue.

NEW YORK, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange on Friday said the trading halt on shares of collapsed energy giant Enron Corp. would continue pending information on the terms of the proposed transaction with Swiss bank UBS AG. 
The stock exchange said it continues to review Enron's listing status in light of recent events.
On Friday, Enron said UBS agreed to take control of its key energy trading unit after an auction left rival bidder Citigroup Inc. empty handed. 
Trading in shares of Enron were suspended on the New York Stock Exchange all day Friday. The stock closed Thursday at 67 cents, a fraction of its former value of $90 a share 18 months ago.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron spread the wealth around Washington.
By Susan Cornwell

01/11/2002
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2002. 

WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Former energy-trading giant Enron Corp. not only lavished campaign donations on President George W. Bush, but was one of America's biggest political contributors, spreading money across both parties on Capitol Hill. 
Nearly half the current U.S. House of Representatives and almost three-quarters of the current Senate have been beneficiaries of Enron largesse in recent years, say the Washington watchdog groups that monitor campaign cash.
Since 1989, Enron has made a whopping $5.8 million in campaign donations, 73 percent to Republicans and 27 percent to Democrats, says the Center for Responsive Politics, an organization that tracks political giving. 
Nearly half of these funds were donated during 1999-2000, when Enron was one of the top 50 organizational donors in the United States, the Center says. 
The money kept coming in until just before Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2. Since then, as the controversy around Enron has grown, some donations have been given back. 
Texans were by far the biggest Enron recipients, and Republicans got more than Democrats. Bush, being both a Texan and a Republican, and a friend of Enron chairman Kenneth Lay to boot, did very well. 
Enron was Bush's biggest political patron as he headed into the 2000 presidential election. In all it has made $623,000 in contributions to his campaigns since 1993, when he was raising money for his first Texas gubernatorial race, according to the Center for Public Integrity, another follow-the-money group. 
'MONEY FOR ACCESS' 
But the giving did not stop after election day. Enron officials contributed $10,500 to his Florida recount committee, and when the recount was ended, they donated $300,000 for the inaugural celebrations, said Holley Bailey, researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics. 
""I think what is interesting about their giving over the last year, is that they used any method possible to support President Bush's campaign run,"" she said. 
What Enron got in exchange for the money was access, Bailey asserted. She noted that Lay had met Vice President Dick Cheney during last year's California energy crisis, at the same time the administration was formulating its energy policy. 
""One thing is clear. They have written checks to a lot of people in this town and I guess that gets their phone calls answered when they call Cabinet secretaries,"" Bailey said. 
It was disclosed this week that Lay telephoned two Cabinet officials last fall as the company's financial situation worsened. Enron on Dec. 2 made the largest bankruptcy court filing in U.S. history. 
The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into Enron's collapse, which wiped out the pensions of thousands, and several congressional committees are also investigating. 
MIDAS TOUCH 
The White House points out, accurately, that Enron also contributed money to lawmakers, Democrats among them. Indeed, on Capitol Hill, few have escaped Enron's Midas touch. 
Texas Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and Phil Gramm, both Republicans, top the list, having received $99,500 and $97,350 respectively in campaign contributions from Enron, the Center for Responsive Politics says. 
But senior Democrats and those on committees relevant to Enron's energy-trading business got donations too. For example, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, a Democrat, received $21,933, the Center said. He is on the energy committee. 
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota received $6,000 in Enron contributions. Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who chairs the governmental affairs committee that will probe Enron's fall, got a $2,000 donation. 
In the House, the top beneficiary of Enron generosity, Democrat Ken Bentsen of Texas, has received $42,750 in contributions since he was elected in 1994. 
But Bentsen is giving back $2,000 of Enron money he has received since the last election - not to Enron, though. He is looking for a fund that will help its laid-off employees. 
He's not the only one shunning Enron money now. The National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee as well as the Republican Governors Association recently returned Enron donations totaling $160,000. 
And the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is giving to charity a $100,000 Enron donation that it received in late November, just days before Enron filed for bankruptcy. 
Asked why he topped the House list of Enron recipients, Bentsen explained that his district is in the greater Houston area, where Enron is based, and that he has had to raise a lot of money over his career fighting well-financed challengers. 
""The bottom line is somedays I've enjoyed support from Enron and other days I haven't,"" Bentsen added. He recalls Lay supported his opponent, Dolly Madison McKenna, in 1996. 
""He (Lay) said, 'I think she's going to be better than you.' It really made me mad,"" Bentsen said.

Senator Says Panel to Subpoena Enron And Arthur Andersen, Among Others

Dow Jones Newswires 
DETROIT -- U.S. Sen. Carl Levin said Friday a congressional panel will issue 51 subpoenas to embattled energy-trading giant Enron Corp., its auditor Arthur Anderson, and others following Anderson's disclosure it destroyed documents related to its work for Enron.
At a press briefing in Detroit, Mr. Levin (D., Mich.), said the Anderson subpoena will require that the firm submit all information, including e-mails and other documents. The return date on the subpoena is Jan. 31. 
""It is troubling that when there's an investigation going on that they (Arthur Anderson) would destroy the documents of their clients,"" Mr. Levin told reporters. 
Mr. Levin said he learned about the destruction of documents Thursday. Enron (ENE) hasn't responded to the subpoenas. 
Enron, Houston, went from a being a darling of Wall Street to making the largest bankruptcy filing in the nation's history in December. The Justice Department is investigating the company because of questions about the company's accounting practices and possible criminal wrongdoing. 
""The criminal investigation by the Department of Justice is not surprising in light of what is known so far,"" Mr. Levin said in a statement. 
Mr. Levin also said at the briefing that it's likely that the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will learn about other things that will ""no doubt lead to other subpoenas.""

Federal Judge Declines To Transfer Enron Case To Houston
By Kathy Chu

01/11/2002
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal bankruptcy judge declined to transfer beleaguered Enron Corp.'s (ENE) bankruptcy case to Houston - as some creditors have requested - giving the company its second taste of victory Friday.
The move, by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, was widely expected by many bankruptcy experts and is an attempt to maintain stability for a case that's almost six weeks old. 
Earlier Friday, Enron said that Swiss bank UBS AG has agreed to buy part of the bankrupt company's energy-trading operations. This deal is considered vital to reviving a stagnant business that generated 90% of the company's $101 billion in revenue last year. 

In his 42-page ruling issued late Friday, Judge Gonzalez said New York is the ""most efficient forum"" for administering Enron's bankruptcy case. 
""New York is a world financial center, and as such, has the resources that will be required to address the debtors' financial issues,"" he said. 
Also, because the parties ""most essential"" to reorganization are here, it makes sense for the court to retain jurisdiction, according to Gonzalez. 
The company's debtor-in-possession lenders, its financial advisers and the majority of its lawyers are based in Manhattan. Also, 11 of the company's 20 largest unsecured claims - belonging to a handful of financial institutions - emanate from New York. 

The judge said that, while he is ""sympathetic"" to the concerns of Enron's former employees - who have said it would be a burden for them to attend hearings outside of Texas - many of the issues concerning these workers will be addressed by congressional and federal investigations. 
Employees lost billions of dollars in savings when Enron's energy-trading operations collapsed after the company's debt was downgraded to junk. In the weeks leading up to the rating agencies' decisions, Enron restated more than three years of earnings and wrote down $1.2 billion in shareholder equity. 
The company's 401(k) plan holders, along with creditors such as former merger partner Dynegy Inc. (DYN), El Paso Merchant Energy LP and Dunhill Resources have all sought the case's transfer to Texas. 
When informed late Friday by Dow Jones Newswires of the judge's decision to keep the case in New York, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said, ""... Obviously, we are supportive of the decision.""

Ashcroft spoke to business group after Enron's Lay made request, Justice Department says

WASHINGTON (AP) - Shortly after he was confirmed as attorney general, John Ashcroft was invited by Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay to speak at an exclusive meeting of corporate leaders, Justice Department officials said Friday. 
Lay, who was vice chairman of the Business Council, introduced Ashcroft at the Feb. 22, 2001, meeting in Washington. Ashcroft spoke about the importance of lowering crime.
Government officials, including Federal Reserve members as well as Cabinet secretaries from all recent administrations, have spoken at other meetings of the Business Council, whose members are executives of the nation's largest companies. 
Ashcroft's speech was arranged by his schedulers and the attorney general never spoke directly to Lay, said department officials. 
The information was released in response to an inquiry by The Associated Press about Ashcroft's dealings with Enron since he became attorney general. 
Lay and Enron executives donated over $50,000 to Ashcroft's fund-raising committees in his unsuccessful campaign for Senate re-election in 2000. 
Ashcroft has recused himself from a Justice Department criminal investigation of the failed energy company. 
Lay's contacts with members of the Bush administration were the focus of intense scrutiny after officials disclosed that Lay and Enron's president had contacted two Cabinet members and a top Treasury official for help when the company was in a financial tailspin.

Enron asked Treasury official to `call the banks' to help avoid bankruptcy
By TOM RAUM
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - Enron sought the Bush administration's intervention with banks in an effort late last year to stop the company's spiral into bankruptcy, the U.S. Treasury Department disclosed Friday as the White House worked to control political fallout from a widening investigation. 
""This dog won't hunt. That's a reference to the politics of it,"" said presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer amid the latest information on the collapse of the Houston-based energy conglomerate.
Enron President Lawrence ""Greg"" Whalley telephoned Treasury's undersecretary for domestic finance, Peter Fisher, ""six to eight times"" in late October and early November, said department spokeswoman Michele Davis. 
It was the first indication that the energy trading firm, which has ties to many top Bush administration officials, had asked for government intervention as it faced collapse. Once the seventh largest U.S. company, Enron delcared bankruptcy Dec. 2. 
""As Enron's negotiations with its bankers for an extension of credit neared a decision point, the president of Enron asked Undersecretary Fisher to call the banks,"" Davis said. 
Fisher ""inferred he was being asked to encourage the banks to extend credit. He made no such calls,"" she said. 
The announcement followed disclosures that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, one of President George W. Bush's biggest political contributors, had called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in the days leading up to the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history last fall. 
Administration officials have denied that any government aid was ever extended to the beleaguered company. 
Democrats, seeing the disclosures as an opportunity to chip away at Bush's high approval ratings, are emphasizing the close ties between Enron and administration officials and the impact of the failure on Enron employees. 
Thousands of workers were laid off and many saw their retirement nest eggs vanish when Enron stock plunged in advance of the bankruptcy filing. 
White House officials worked Friday to try to limit the damage, and to put distance between the president and the Enron chief. 
""This needs to be fully investigated to determine if there was any criminal wrongdoing by Enron,"" said Bush press secretary Fleischer. He said the president also is pressing for a review of rules governing 401(k) retirement plans like those at Enron. 
""If anybody else wants to focus on politics, that's their prerogative. But the president's focus is on getting to the bottom of this fully,"" Fleischer said aboard Air Force One on a presidential trip to Pennsylvania. 
Meanwhile, senior Bush adviser Karl Rove offered his view of the relationship between Bush and Lay. ""The president knows him. He is a friend. But the idea that he is a friend in the sense that this is a guy who's a close intimate is just ludicrous,"" Rove said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
When Bush was the governor of Texas, Lay was chairman of the governor's business council. ""They had quarterly meetings and he'd come in and talk to the then-governor about what it was they hoped to achieve at the meeting and they'd go over the agenda,"" Rove said. 
Bush has described Lay as ""a supporter."" He said he saw Lay twice last year, but that they did not discuss Enron's finances.

Congress Demands Documents From Enron, Andersen (Update2)
2002-01-11 18:10 (New York)

Congress Demands Documents From Enron, Andersen (Update2)

     (Adds Fisher's lack of holdings in 12th paragraphs.)

     Washington, Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Congress demanded
documents and personal files from executives at Enron Corp.,
auditor Arthur Andersen LLP and 49 current and former officers and
directors in an effort to find out what led to the biggest U.S.
bankruptcy.
     The House Energy and Commerce Committee asked for the
personal files of David Duncan and five other Andersen partners
involved in the audit of Enron, after Andersen said its employees
had destroyed documents and e-mails, committee spokesman Ken
Johnson said. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations subpoenaed papers from both Enron, once the biggest
energy trader, and Andersen.
      Congress acted a day after President George W. Bush's
administration said Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, a long-time
political backer of the president, had unsuccessfully sought
government help for Enron from Commerce Secretary Don Evans and
Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill. Today Treasury disclosed that
Enron President Greg Whalley called Undersecretary Peter Fisher at
least six times in October and early November to ask him to
contact bankers on behalf of the company.
     ``This debacle is so massive, it requires speed and
thoroughness,'' said Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who
is chairman of the Subcommittee on Investigations. ``The subpoenas
are necessary in order to get prompt and thorough review of the
documents in question.''
     Levin said the subpoenas were changed at the last minute
yesterday to request information on Andersen's destruction of
documents, a development he said was ``very troubling.'' Responses
to the subpoenas are due Jan. 31, Levin said.

                         $26 Billion Loss

     Enron said Nov. 8 that it had inflated earnings by $586
million over four years. The company filed for bankruptcy
protection Dec. 2 after a seven-week stock slide that erased $26
billion in value. Employees who were unable to sell Enron stock in
their retirement plans say they lost about $850 million.
     At least six congressional committees are investigating
Enron's collapse. Committee leaders say they need to understand
exactly what happened at Enron to determine whether new laws and
regulations are needed to improve disclosure, change accounting
practices or protect employee retirement accounts.

                        Contacts Disclosed

     After declining to comment in detail on Enron's bankruptcy
for several weeks, yesterday the administration said Lay called
Evans on Oct. 29 and asked him to intervene with Moody's Investors
Service to prevent a downgrade of Enron's debt, Commerce spokesman
Jim Dyke said.
     ``Evans decided that taking any action would be
inappropriate,'' Dyke said. ``There was no information exchanged
between Mr. Lay and Secretary Evans that was not part of the
public domain.''
     Lay also spoke with O'Neill about how a collapse of Enron
might hurt financial markets, Treasury spokeswoman Michelle Davis
said yesterday. O'Neill also decided to take no action.
     When Whalley called Fisher, ``Undersecretary Fisher inferred
he was being asked to encourage banks to extend credit,'' Davis
said. ``He made no such calls.''
     Treasury said that while a trust in his parents name included
Enron shares, Fisher ``does not now and never has held common
stock in Enron.''
     Evans and O'Neill didn't tell Bush about the calls until
yesterday, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said. Bush said he
hasn't spoken to Lay in more than six months.

                      Campaign Contributions

     Lay raised more than $100,000 for Bush's presidential
campaign and let Bush aides use Enron's corporate jet on at least
30 occasions. Enron and its employees together were Bush's 12th-
largest backer for the election, giving $113,800. Enron and its
employees gave Democrat Al Gore $11,250.
     Representative Henry Waxman of California, the senior
Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, today sent
letters to O'Neill and Evans, requesting details on all contacts
between Enron and officials at Treasury and Commerce. He also
wants to know what the two departments told the White House.
     ``The purpose of this request is to determine why the
administration apparently did nothing to mitigate the harm of the
Enron bankruptcy to thousands of its employees and shareholders,''
Waxman wrote.

                         Senate Subpoenas

     The documents sought by the Senate include working papers and
notes from the auditors, memorandums from executives putting into
place internal controls, and memos outlining and describing
financing vehicles used for off-balance-sheet financing and other
transactions.
     Lay, who got $101 million from the sale of his Enron shares,
according to plaintiff's attorneys representing shareholders, is
among those receiving subpoenas from the Senate committee.
     Jeffrey Skilling, the former chief executive officer who
resigned on Aug. 14, is also subpoenaed, along with former Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.
     Members of the board of directors also were receiving
subpoenas, including former Commodities Futures Trading Commission
Chairwoman Wendy Gramm, the wife of Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas
Republican, and a member of Enron's audit committee.

                       Partnerships Targeted

     The Senate subcommittee is targeting ``offshore entities,
special-purpose entities and limited partnerships that Enron
used,'' Levin said. It is asking whether the financing techniques
Enron used should have raised flags for Enron's board and
Andersen.
     SEC Enforcement Director Stephen Cutler said yesterday the
SEC will add Andersen's document destruction to the Enron-related
matters it is investigating.
     ``Destruction of documents is obviously an extremely serious
matter,'' Cutler said.
     Lawyers representing investors in lawsuits against Enron are
watching the subcommittee because it is likely to obtain
information sooner than will the civil courts.
     Most of the shareholder lawsuits were filed in federal court
in Houston and won't move to the discovery phase, in which lawyers
may interrogate defendants and demand documents, for six months.
     ``Skilling was clearly moving the company from an asset-based
model to a pure trading machine,'' said Patrick Daniels, a lawyer
at Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach. ``You would hope someone
inside Enron was doing some analysis of how these deals would
benefit Enron.''
     Milberg Weiss represents the University of California, which
lost $144 million in Enron's stock slide, and Deutsche Asset
Management, which lost $61 million.

Treasury Spokesman Nichols Comments on Fisher's Enron Holdings
2002-01-11 18:02 (New York)


     Washington, Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Following are comments by
U.S. Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Rob Nichols on
Undersecretary of Treasury for Domestic Finance Peter Fisher's
holdings in Enron Corp.

     ``Peter Fisher does not now and never has held common stock
in Enron Corp. Fisher has a potential, partial, revocable interest
in a trust which includes a holding of Enron shares that could
pass to him only upon that death of both of his parents.
     ``At the start of the fourth quarter, the holdings were de
minimis. De minimis is a regulatory term that means less than
$5,000. The law expressly permits a government official to
participate in a matter in which there is only a de minimis
interest.''

Justice Dept. Enron Probe Overseen by Former Senate Counsel

Justice Dept. Enron Probe Overseen by Former Senate Counsel

     Washington, Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Justice
Department probe of Enron Corp. will be overseen by a lawyer with
more than 20 years of prosecution experience, including running
the U.S. Senate's investigation into the Whitewater scandal.
     Michael Chertoff, the head of the department's criminal
division, was Republican counsel to the special committee that
investigated the involvement of former President Bill Clinton and
his wife in the failed Whitewater real-estate development.
     The Justice Department's investigation into the collapse of
the world's largest energy trader will be led by Joshua Hochberg,
the head of the department's fraud section since December 1998.
Hochberg will be the acting U.S. attorney for the case.
     ``Hochberg will be the day-to-day supervisor. Chertoff would
be involved in big decisions -- decisions to indict or make a deal
with low-level employees,'' said Gregory Wallance, a former
federal prosecutor.
     U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft won't be involved in the
investigation, having announced yesterday his recusal from Enron
matters. The Houston-based company was a major contributor to his
2000 Senate campaign.
     Next in line is Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, who
is expected to have little involvement in the investigation, legal
experts say.

                            Task Force

     The Justice Department is establishing an Enron task force,
to be headed by Leslie Caldwell, the chief of the criminal
division for the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco.
Caldwell, who has prosecuted organized crime and while collar
crime, will report to Hochberg.
     Enron announced Nov. 8 that it had inflated earnings by $585
million over four years. On Dec. 2, it filed the biggest U.S.
bankruptcy after a seven-week stock slide that erased $26 billion
in market value, wiped out 5,000 jobs and cost employees about
$850 million in retirement savings.
     During that period, employees were unable to sell Enron stock
in their 401(k) plans. Top executives who had large holdings
outside of the retirement plan were able to sell.
     The investigation will likely concentrate on whether
executives purposely misled investors about Enron's financial
condition to prove criminal wrongdoing, experts say.
     Deliberate misrepresentation of a company's financial
condition transforms what is usually a civil violation of federal
disclosure rules into a crime punishable by as much as 10 years in
prison and a $1 million fine.

                    `Best and Brightest'

     The investigation will be based in Washington and include
lawyers from the criminal division, including the fraud section,
and from U.S. attorneys' offices throughout the country. Lawyers
from the New York and San Francisco offices, which specialize in
securities law and white collar crime, are expected to be
involved, a Justice Department official said.
     ``We're bringing in our best and brightest,'' said Justice
Department spokesman Bryan Sierra. ``You go where they are known
for this type of investigations.''
     The decision to centralize the investigation makes sense
because ``there's an enormous amount of legwork that goes into a
case like this,'' said Wallance. ``It's inefficient to duplicate
efforts.''
     A grand jury is either already in the works or about to be
impaneled, experts say. Investigators will be culling through
documents, computer records, bank records and conducting scores of
interviews, experts say.
     ``They will be looking at what was being said, to whom it was
being said and why it was being said,'' said Joe Whitley, a former
acting associate attorney general.
     Document destruction by Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor,
will also be examined to determine if the firm can be charged with
obstruction of justice, Whitley said.

                    Recusals, Recusals

     Ashcroft's announcement that he wouldn't participate in the
Enron probe followed a call to step aside by U.S. Representative
Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, who cited about $55,000 that
Enron and its Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay made to
political groups aiding Ashcroft's unsuccessful re-election bid.
     When Ashcroft recused himself from the investigation, he was
unaware of the letter sent to his office by Waxman, a Justice
Department official said.
     The U.S. attorney's office in Houston also recused itself
from the investigation because of the ``fact that a number of
attorneys in the office, including the U.S. attorney, have family
relationships with individuals who are arguably affected by the
Enron bankruptcy,'' according to a statement released by U.S.
Attorney Michael Shelby.
     The Justice Department said it hasn't determined yet how it
will conduct the investigation in Houston, though it may use
Federal Bureau of Investigation facilities there.

                           Men in Charge

     In addition to the Enron probe, Chertoff is also running the
investigation into the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
     A Harvard Law School graduate, Chertoff was U.S. attorney in
New Jersey between 1990 and 1994. He was in charge of prosecuting
``Crazy Eddie'' Antar for securities fraud, New York's former
chief judge, and the kidnappers and murderers of an Exxon Corp.
executive. After leaving the U.S. attorney's office, Chertoff
became a partner in the law firm of Latham & Watkins.
     Hochberg prosecuted the brother of former New York Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato for mail fraud, resulting in a conviction. A
former deputy chief of public integrity at the department,
Hochberg reviewed Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's Whitewater
investigation and declined to call it off.
     ``He's a career prosecutor,'' said Whitley. ``He's capable
and able to cause people to collaborate. He will be an effective
leader.''

Enron Bankruptcy to Stay in New York; Move to Houston Denied
2002-01-11 17:42 (New York)

Enron Bankruptcy to Stay in New York; Move to Houston Denied

     New York, Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy
case, the largest in U.S. history, will stay in New York, a judge
has ruled.
     The decision is a defeat for Dynegy Inc. and other Enron
creditors who had asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez
to move the case to Houston. Enron and Dynegy, rival energy
traders, are both based there.
     Gonzalez also denied Dynegy's request to transfer a $10
billion lawsuit Enron brought against Dynegy for backing out of a
merger that was supposed to rescue Enron.
     Enron's Chapter 11 case and the lawsuit were filed Dec. 2 in
Manhattan, where a small unit, Enron Metals and Commodity Corp.,
is based.
     Dynegy argued in court papers that both cases should be
shifted to Houston ``in the interest of justice and for the
convenience of the parties.''
     Enron, once a dominant force in the energy trading business,
collapsed after announcing on Nov. 8 that it inflated earnings by
$586 million over four years. The disclosure triggered a loss of
confidence among investors and customers and the cancellation of a
planned $23 billion merger with Dynegy.
     The effort to move the case to Houston divided Enron's
creditors. Some banks, including several based in New York and led
by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., opposed a transfer.
A committee appointed to represent Enron's unsecured
creditors also favored keeping the case in New York.
     Some Houston-based creditors of Enron, such as El Paso Group
Inc., Reliant Energy Services Inc. and a group of Enron 401(k)
plan holders, supported Dynegy's request for a change of venue.

Andersen's Berardino Gave Incorrect Enron Testimony to Congress
2002-01-11 17:36 (New York)

Andersen's Berardino Gave Incorrect Enron Testimony to Congress

     Washington, Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Arthur Andersen LLP Chief
Executive Joseph Berardino gave inaccurate testimony to Congress
last month about its audit of an Enron Corp. partnership because
he didn't know the facts until this week, an Andersen spokesman
said.
     ``We're still trying to understand why he didn't know about
it,'' Andersen spokesman David Tabolt said. ``There are millions
of Enron documents we have to deal with, and we're doing the best
we can.''
     Berardino, who has headed the fifth largest accounting firm
for a year, identified incorrectly who joined Enron in investing
in an affiliated partnership of the company. That partnership,
called Chewco Investments LP, was kept off Enron's books, enabling
the energy trader to inflate earnings by $400 million starting in
1997.
     Andersen's accounting of Enron is under investigation by the
Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and
Congress. Andersen said yesterday that some of its employees
destroyed a substantial number of documents related to its Enron
audit.
     Berardino learned of the correct information earlier this
week when a news reporter called with an inquiry and Andersen
looked up the answer, Tabolt said. The mistake was inconsequential
because it would have had no effect on how Andersen handled its
Enron audits or on the substance of Berardino's testimony, he
said.
     Berardino told the House Financial Services Committee on Dec.
12 that Andersen informed Enron's audit committee ``of possible
illegal acts within the company'' involving Chewco. Andersen
wasn't aware during the audits of the extent of Enron's financial
commitment to Chewco, information that would have compelled the
partnership to be included on Enron's books, Berardino testified.

                         Small Companies

     Enron's partner in the investment was ``a large financial
institution,'' Berardino told Congress. This institution, which
the Wall Street Journal identified as Barclays Plc, a British
banking group, was to have its losses covered by Enron, Berardino
said. Andersen wasn't aware of the extent of Enron's commitment,
he said.
     The Chewco investor wasn't ``a large financial institution''
but two limited-liability companies called Big River and Little
River, Tabolt said. These two small companies borrowed about $11
million from the large bank, he said. A Barclay's spokesman
declined to comment.
     Andersen discovered Berardino's error this week while
researching the answer to a Wall Street Journal reporter's
question, Tabolt said.

                       `No Material Effect'

     ``The mistake had no material effect on Mr. Berardino's
testimony,'' Tabolt said. ``We're still trying to understand why
we weren't made aware of the information at the time of the
audits.''
     Spokesmen for House Financial Services Committee Chairman
Mike Oxley and Representative Richard Baker, chairman of the
panel's subcommittee on capital markets, didn't respond to
requests for comment.

Enron CEO Resigns From Compaq's Board of Directors (Update5)
2002-01-11 17:39 (New York)

Enron CEO Resigns From Compaq's Board of Directors (Update5)

     (Adds more comment from Lorsch in the eighth paragraph.)

     Houston, Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. Chairman and
Chief Executive Kenneth Lay resigned from the board of Compaq
Computer Corp., as Congress increases scrutiny of Enron's
bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history.
     Lay, 59, stepped down ``to focus on his other
responsibilities,'' said Sarah Thobae, a spokeswoman for Houston-
based Compaq, the second largest-personal computer maker. A
director since 1987, Lay resigned effective Dec. 31, she said.
     Enron, once the biggest energy trader, said Nov. 8 that it
had inflated earnings by $586 million over four years. The company
filed Dec. 2 for bankruptcy protection after a seven-week stock
slide that erased $26 billion in value. Lay quit as a director of
Eli Lilly and Co. on Dec. 11 and left the board of directors of I2
Technologies in October.
     ``It could be that he knows something that's going to happen
that will be embarrassing'' for the companies regarding the
bankruptcy, said Jay Lorsch, a Harvard Business School professor
who's written about corporate governance. ``He might want to avoid
them that embarrassment.''
     Lorsch said he doesn't think Lay was forced from the boards
because so much time passed between the resignations.
     Yesterday, President George W. Bush's administration said Lay
unsuccessfully sought help for Enron from two Cabinet secretaries.
Lay called Commerce Secretary Don Evans on Oct. 29 and also spoke
with Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill. Neither took action on
behalf of Houston-based Enron, the administration said.


                      President's Task Force

     Bush yesterday appointed a task force to investigate Enron's
collapse and at least six congressional committees are
investigating. Congress today demanded documents and personal
files from executives of Enron and its auditor, Arthur Andersen
LLP.
     ``If there are some kind of legal actions being taken against
him, he might want to free himself of the connections'' to other
boards, Lorsch said.
     The shares of Compaq rose 50 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $11.50
in regular U.S. trading and have fallen 40 percent in the past
year.
     Lay in October sold 124,596 Compaq shares valued at $1.15
million, according to a regulatory filing. He still owned 340,724
shares at the month's end.
     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Lay remains on the board
of TCW Group Inc., a money-management firm with more than $75
billion in assets under management.
     Compaq now has seven members on its board and has no
immediate plans to name a new member, Thobae said.
     Compaq agreed to be acquired by rival Hewlett-Packard Co. on
Sept. 3 after a unanimous vote by the board. If the deal is
completed, its proposed acquisition of Compaq, five Compaq
directors will join Hewlett-Packard's board.

USA: Enron shares in stay in doldrums after downgrade.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s share price hovered above seven-year lows touched in earlier trade Monday after Moody's Investor Service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of North America's largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status. 
Enron, the largest electricity and natural gas trader in North America, also on Monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks.
Enron shares were down $1.40, or 9.03 percent, to $14.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier in the session trading below $14 for the first time since December 1994. 
Moody's also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded to Baa2, as well as its rating for the Enron's commercial paper. 
Enron's credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day trading operations and its trading partners' perception of making good on trades. With a credit rating hovering above junk status, the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. 
Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

USA: US companies' credit quality to worsen-Moody's.
By Jonathan Stempel

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better, a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on Monday. 
Moody's Investors Service said that in the third quarter, it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 U.S. companies. At the same time, it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies.
That 5.5-to-1 ratio is far greater than the 1.3-to-1 ratio in the second quarter. 
In dollar terms, the situation looks more dire. Moody's warned it may downgrade $543 billion of debt, dwarfing the $66 billion Moody's said it may upgrade by 8.2-to-1. 
""Particularly in light of September 11, the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. ""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year."" 
Rating reviews are significant because, unlike actual rating changes, they are not a ""lagging"" indicator, and suggest the future direction of corporate credit. Moody's normally wraps up its reviews within three months. 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. These include the weakening U.S. economy, an inability of marginal companies to raise cash, debt-financed merger activity and fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance, and travel. 
For example, Moody's in July warned it may cut Comcast Corp.'s ratings after the Philadelphia-based company bid $44.5 billion for AT&T Corp.'s cable TV operations. 
Then last month, Moody's warned it may cut Chicago-based Boeing Co.'s ratings because of the attacks' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes. 
In the third quarter, Moody's warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative-grade, or ""junk""-rated, companies, and raise the ratings of just 11. For investment-grade companies, the gap was even more yawning: 68-to-11. 
And in the fourth quarter? Through Friday, Moody's warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four. On Monday, it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp., and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade. 
Puchalla, however, said the decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues,"" he said. ""That is a positive for credit quality."" 
The third quarter was the 14th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades. The record is 19 quarters, set between 1988 and 1993.

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

     (Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.30, or 8.4 percent, to
$14.10 in midday trading. Earlier, they touched $13.55, down 12
percent. The company's credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors
Service after it wrote down the value of its assets.

     The stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months.

USA: Enron shares drop despite further triage attempts.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron shares slipped to a new six-year low in early trade as North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader said it was talking to banks about tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron's shares were trading down 90 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $14.60 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares crashed through $15, a low not seen since February 1995.
Last week, Enron shed almost $14 billion in market value as its stock price tumbled more than half since last week, when a series of piecemeal disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
However, many industry observers see Enron's request for an additional credit after tapping its banks for $3.3 billion last week after as a sign a weakness not of strength. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carole Levenson, research analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
Enron shares sank 50 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $15 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. ((David Howard Sinkman, New York Newsdesk 646-223-6094)).

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a new move to shore up investor confidence after it tapped about $3 billion in credit last week, and to stop a plunge in the company's stock that set new six-year lows. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line.
Enron shares crashed through a psychological barrier of $15 a share, shedding $1.66, or 10.65 percent, to $13.85 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost more than half of its value in the past two weeks, losing more than $14 billion in market capitalization. 
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston. 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
""Clearly, both the stock and bond market view Enron as being in dire straits,"" said independent research firm Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead it's an act of desperation.""

POWER POINTS:Enron May Have To Rethink Asset-Light Focus
By Mark Golden

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- On the face of things, it's hard to understand the stock market's headspinning reaction to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks.
Why the talk of a ""death spiral"" for North America's premier energy trading company? The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), for example, saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12-month period. Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco. 
The difference is that over the past few years, Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question. 
If you're buying network components, you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier. After all, you're buying something you can touch. But if you're buying power or gas, what you're really buying is a commitment to deliver. If your supplier doesn't come through when the market gets tough, you're left totally exposed. In Enron's energy trading business, then, credibility at every level is critical. 
For now, Enron looks to be more than viable. But the company's asset-light strategy might not be. Gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1.65% in the third quarter from 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, asset-heavy energy companies like Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure. 
Two weeks ago, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. That didn't send investors running, however. In fact, its stock price rose a bit on the news. 
What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets, or ""shareholders' equity,"" by $1.2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. That, along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission produced a $15.6 billion drop in Enron's market value. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enron's senior, unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, leaving it two steps above junk-bond levels. The agency kept Enron's ratings on watch for further downgrade. 
Long-Running Concerns 

A 50% hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a 10% reduction in shareholders' equity. The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enron's loss of credibility. Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them, but few on the call believed that. 
For some analysts, Enron's revelations only fed long-running concerns about the company's lack of financial disclosure. 
Cary Wasden, managing partner of Reed Wasden Research, has had a ""sell"" recommendation on Enron since March. Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms, Wasden isn't in the business of selling stock. His firm isn't involved in brokerage and isn't a hedge fund. Wasden gets paid for his research, and the company doesn't invest in the securities it covers. 
A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from one-time sale of physical assets in operating income. His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years - a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldn't immediately respond. 
""Don't believe by any means this is the end of the story,"" Wasden said. 
Wall Street sell-side analysts have largely kept Enron as a ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" as the stock fell from $90 to $20. But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enron's reporting. 
For now, the plunge in the price of Enron's shares and bonds, which last week started trading like junk-rated debt, hasn't hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners. 
""We haven't changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices. We're watching it, and so is everybody else, but they are a solid company,"" Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction. ""This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that I'm sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point."" 
Keeping Talent A Challenge 

Enron is a big company - far too big to ignore. But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders' transactions with Enron. If the company's investment-grade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed, risk managers won't be able to ignore it, whatever else Moody's does. 
Assuming that doesn't happen, Enron still faces a tough road ahead. Like all companies, Enron is the combination of capital and talent. For financial companies, talent is the more important ingredient, and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time. 
New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August, and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year. The losses can be expected to continue. Much of the top management cashed out when the company's stock price was high and moved on. Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on, if they haven't already. 
Over the years, Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry. Those options are now nearly worthless. If Enron's debt-service costs rise, the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America. 
Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top. When Skilling left, nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lay's assurances that it was for ""personal reasons."" When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week, Lay said, ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO."" 
That's putting words in Wall Street analysts' mouths. Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer? 
""I don't know anybody who said that,"" Wasden said. ""What did the CFO do, what did Skilling do, that Ken Lay wasn't part of?"" 
Real change will have to come from without, Wasden said. 
""Enron has been a cult, more than a company,"" he said. ""Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company, it just changes the disciples. Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside."" 
Nevertheless, Wasden thinks Enron's stock has reached its natural floor and, if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money, it can recover over time. 
""There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets, like pipelines and power plants,"" he said. 
That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating. Given the bind Enron is in, Lay won't have much choice. Enron will survive, but it won't be the same company at all.

OFFICIAL CORRECTION Enron long-term ratings downgraded to Baa2 - Moody's

10/29/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

(Moody's corrected its stance on Enron ratings to a downgrade) 
NEW YORK (AFX) - Moody's Investors Service said it has lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Enron Corp from Baa1 to Baa2 following a deterioration in Enron's financial flexibility since the company announced significant writedowns as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments.
The long-term debt ratings remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said. 
Moody's also placed the company's Prime-2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade. 
Moody's initially placed Enron's long-term debt ratings on review on Oct 16. The write-downs and equity charges led to a substantial loss in investor confidence that has led to a more than halving of Enron's share price and difficulties in rolling over commercial paper, according to Moody's. 
In response to these events, Moody's said Enron has shored up its near-term liquidity position by drawing down on all of its committed revolving credit facilities and buying back its outstanding commercial paper, leaving the company with a net cash position of approximately 1.2 bln usd. 
Moody's said it plans to focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties.

USA: Moody's cuts Enron to 2 notches above ""junk"".

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp.'s senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status, and warned it may cut that rating again, as well as its rating for Enron's commercial paper. 
The rating agency cut Houston-based Enron's senior unsecured debt to ""Baa2"" from ""Baa1,"" and said it may cut Enron's ""Prime-2"" commercial paper rating, which affects short-term debt. Its rating actions affect $13 billion.
Moody's said Enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write-downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments this month. This triggered ""difficulties in rolling over commercial paper,"" Moody's said. 
Enron, which has about $63.4 billion in energy assets, said on Monday it is talking with banks to get more credit, after last week drawing down $3 billion from a bank credit line to buy back its outstanding commercial paper. 
Its shares traded Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.75, down $1.75, or 11.3 percent. They have fallen 62 percent since Oct. 12, from $35.81. 
Rating agency, Standard & Poor's, on Thursday revised its outlook for Enron's ratings to ""negative"" from ""stable.""

UK: Europe energy firms wary of Enron on credit worries.
By Stuart Penson

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy companies in Europe are shying away from trading with troubled U.S. energy group Enron amid concerns about the company's credit status, industry sources said on Monday. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron - one of Europe's biggest gas and power traders - as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements, the sources said.
""I think Enron's approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow,"" said the head of risk management at one UK utility that halted its trade with Enron last week. 
""They are talking with us about bank letters of credit,"" he said. ""The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis."" 
A spokesman for Enron's European headquarters in London headquarters declined to comment. 
Reluctance to trade with Enron in Europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five-year lows. 
Triggering the slide was news last week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer. 
Houston-based Enron trades a large amount of its volume in the U.S. and Europe through its Internet EnronOnline system. 
Last Friday the company said trade on EnronOnline was above average levels with more than 8,400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $4 billion. 
Traders said Enron's plight could hit liquidity in European gas and power markets, where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years. 
One industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the UK electricity market had put on hold their trading Enron, which is among the biggest five traders in the market. 
In mainland Europe, where Enron has been a major driver of liquidity, potential counterparties are treading with care. 
""We are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a 'sleeve' (a third party trader),"" said a senior trader at one of Germany's big utilities, who declined to be named. 
French traders said wariness about dealing with Enron had dampened liquidity although Enron was still in the market on Monday morning. 
""Enron is a major player so counter parties are looking to see if there is a problem,"" said one French trader.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Puts Spotlight Back On Broadband
By Michael Rieke

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Thanks to Enron Corp. (ENE), the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money.
But it won't be traders who will cash in on this new potential. It will be class-action attorneys. They're already lining up to sue Enron in at least five shareholder suits. 
As of Oct. 25, two of lawsuits had been filed against Enron in federal court and three more in Texas state court. Most of them name as defendants Ken Lay, Enron's longtime chairman, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence Oct. 25. 
Still another suit, which isn't a class action suit, was filed naming as defendants members of Enron's board of directors. 
All the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships Enron set up, many of them managed by Fastow. Most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the Fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with Enron. 
The transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband, water and other Enron investments. 
Fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions. As Enron's chief financial officer, he was being paid to manage the corporation's finances. As general partner of two LJM partnerships, he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with Enron. He shared in profits of those partnerships. 
When investors began demanding information about the transactions, Enron's share price began to slide. With the heat on, Enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals, among other things. 
That's when the class action attorneys went to work. So far, at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs. Enron didn't respond to calls asking about the lawsuits. 
Among the law firms representing plaintiffs is Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit. The release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $30 billion from class action lawsuits. 
The lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market. Some of the deals with the LJM partnerships run by Fastow ""purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market,"" according to Abrams and Franks v. Enron et al. 
That could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months. Market skeptics have said Enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth. 
Enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties, a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year, according to Enron. 
Now market watchers will want to know if any of Enron's trades were done with the LJM partnerships managed by Fastow. 
They will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with Chewco Investments. That Houston company, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, was managed by Michael Kopper and was set up in 1997 when Kopper was a managing director with Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. He left Enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by Fastow. 
Do the plaintiffs' attorneys know whether Enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships? 
""I think if is too early to tell,"" Thomas Bilek of Hoeffner & Bilek told Bandwidth Beat. ""As you know, (information) is coming out in drabs and dribbles from Enron."" 
It could be several months before plaintiffs' attorneys get a chance to ask Enron officials those questions, Bilek said. 
It's also too early to tell what potential damages plaintiffs could win, said Steven Schulman, an attorney with Milberg Weiss. ""At this point, you can only talk about it in terms of (shareholder) losses, and the losses are in the billions."" 
Total losses will depend on the price each shareholder plaintiff paid for the stock and the price at which each shareholder later sold the stock. 
Enron's share price topped out between $90 and $91 in the summer of last year. It set a 52-week low Oct. 26 at $15.04. That spread leaves plenty of room for losses. 
Schulman told Bandwidth Beat that the record for losses in shareholder cases is $11 billion in a case involving Cendant Corp. (CD). Damages are usually a substantial portion of losses, Schulman said. 
""Whether (the Enron case) is bigger or less, I couldn't opine,"" he said. ""This is a big case, by any means.""

Enron Considered Moving 401(k) Blackout Period
By Jennifer Corbett Dooren

02/05/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) employee benefits managers said Tuesday they considered moving the blackout period that kept employees from making changes in their 401(k) retirement accounts last fall as the firm's stock price continued to slide.
Because Enron was changing retirement plan administrators, the company didn't allow employees access to their retirement accounts from Oct. 26 to Nov. 12. Such blackout periods are common when companies change plan administrators. 
In testimony Tuesday before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Cindy Olson, Enron's executive vice president for human resources, and Mikie Rath, Enron's benefits manager, said they considered moving the blackout period partly because of concerns about Enron's falling stock price, but were advised by a lawyer it was too late. Those discussions occurred in late October, only a few days before the Oct. 26 lock-down date. 
Rath and Olson's accounts were confirmed by representatives from the Northern Trust Retirement Consulting LLC and Hewitt Associates LLC, the firms that kept records for Enron's 401(k) plans. Both companies said they were contacted by Enron about the possibility of moving the blackout period to Jan. 1, 2002. Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, 2001. 
Rath said the decision was made to go forward with the Oct. 26 blackout period because the company would have been unable to notify 11,000 retirees and former employees. Rath and Olson said it was during the anthrax scare when mail service was slow. They said the lawyer advised them there could be problems if current employees and retirees were treated differently. 
Rath also said even though there were indications that Enron was in financial trouble no one knew the extent of the problems in mid-October. 
""If someone said Enron was going to file for bankruptcy I wouldn't have believed them,"" Rath said. She said most employees didn't believe the first news reports that were coming out ""were factual."" 
Rath and Olson's testimony came after tearful testimony from Deborah Perrotta, a former Enron administrative assistant, who lost $40,000 in her 401(k). She recounted how Enron executives including former CEO Kenneth Lay repeatedly told company employees that Enron's future was bright and that the stock price would go up. Enron's stock had been falling all year from about $80 in January 2001. 
During the blackout period that prohibited employees from shifting assets in their 401(k)s, Enron's stock price went from $15.40 to $9.98. 
Lawmakers said that some type of 401(k) legislation would be enacted this year, noting that current laws regulating employee retirement accounts were created before the advent of 401(k) plans where the employee and not the employer is primarily responsible for the investment decisions. 
""The Enron debacle reveals how serious those risks can be for typical American workers when mixed with an undiversified portfolio and corporate deceit and mismanagement,"" said Senate Governmental Affairs Chairman Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn. ""It's time for the law to catch up with reality and protect our workers' 401(k) retirement plan."" 
Several legislative proposals have been introduced in Congress. Some would require employers to give employees impartial investment advice while others would place a cap on the amount of employer stock that can be placed in 401(k) funds. Enron's 401(k) funds had more than 60% of assets in Enron stock.

Congress issues subpoenas to Lay 
Andersen CEO seeks to distance firm from Enron failings

Arthur Anderson CEO Joseph Berardino was questioned harshly Tuesday by a congressional panel investigating the Enron collapse.

By Brock N. Meeks
MSNBC

WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 -  The House Financial Services Committee became the second congressional panel to subpoena ex-Enron chairman Kenneth Lay Tuesday, after the Senate Commerce Committee voted to compel Lay to appear to testify about the circumstances surrounding the failure of the energy-trading firm.

       THE HOUSE SUBPOENA requires Lay to appear before the committee on Feb. 14. Committee chairman Mike Oxley, R-Ohio, said he has received indications from Lay's lawyer that Lay will indeed show up, NBC's Mike Viqueira reported.
       In the Senate, even as lawmakers stressed how important Lay's testimony would be to unearthing the dark logic behind Enron's collapse, all acknowledged there was virtually no chance he would reveal anything beyond invoking his Fifth Amendment rights. ""We have no choice, based on what we've learned"" but to call for a subpoena, said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. ""There truly was a culture of corporate corruption."" 
       In issuing the subpoena, there will be no offer of immunity, said Jay Rockefeller, D-W.V., noting that he wanted to make sure there was no opportunity for thwarting any pending criminal prosecution that may flow from the Enron debacle. In the past, such grants of congressional immunity have tripped up prosecutors, experts said.
       Lay flew back to Houston from Washington on Monday, according to a spokeswoman, who said he would deal with Congress through his lawyer.
       Lay spokeswoman Kelly Kimberly said there was no mystery as to his whereabouts. ""He's here. He came home from Washington yesterday,"" she said.
       However, all a subpoena can do is force someone to appear; it does not compel testimony. If and when Lay does appear before Congress, he is expected to invoke his constitutional right to not testify. In doing so, Lay would be following the footsteps of other ex-Enron executives also expected to do so on Thursday in another round of hearings. 
       ""It's not possible to figure out what caused this huge Enron ship to capsize if you can't hear from the captain,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
       Lay, 59, severed his remaining ties to Enron on Monday, resigning as a member of the board a day after announcing he would not appear before Congress on the advice of his attorney, Earl Silbert. Lay resigned as Enron's chairman and CEO last month.
       In a statement, Lay said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization. Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."" 
       At least 11 committees and subcommittees and the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the collapse of Houston-based Enron, which left thousands of workers unemployed and their retirement funds in shambles because most of their 401(k) investments were in Enron stock that now is nearly worthless.
       As a result of the Enron debacle, President Bush has called for an overhaul of 401(k) laws.
       The Commerce Committee chairman, Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., said a special prosecutor should investigate Enron. He said the Justice Department could not act objectively because of Bush administration officials' ties to the company. 
       The Justice Department said in a statement that it sees no reason to appoint a special counsel to investigate Enron. ""No person involved in pursuing this investigation has any conflict, or any ties that would require a recusal,"" the department said.
       Lay, who lives in Houston but also has homes elsewhere, including Galveston, Texas, and Aspen, Colo., resigned Monday from Enron's board after relinquishing his position as Enron chairman on Jan. 23. Enron and Lay have been among Bush's largest campaign contributors. 
       Opening a week of Enron hearings, lawmakers made clear Monday that they wanted to learn more about what Lay and Enron's board of directors knew about the complex web of questionable partnerships that Enron established to hide financial losses and hundreds of millions of dollars of debt.
       Senior Enron executives involved in the partnerships ""enriched themselves ... by tens of millions of dollars that they should never have received,"" William Powers, the dean of the University of Texas Law School, who headed an internal Enron investigation, told a House Financial Services subcommittee Monday.
       
ROUND ROBIN HEARINGS 
       Powers was questioned Tuesday by the House Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee on his findings, as the CEO of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's former accounting firm, was being grilled by a Financial Services subcommittee.
       Powers restated the findings of the internal Enron investigation he headed that found a ""systematic and pervasive"" attempt by senior Enron managers to ""misrepresent the company's financial condition"" through the use of partnerships that had no economic value to Enron except to hide debt and artificially inflate profits on Enron's balance sheet.
       Rep. Bill Tauzin, R-La., said Powers' report ""tells an old story of insider theft"" and its findings point to ""a high probability of securities fraud and it didn't leave Mr. Lay out.""
       The now infamous off-the-balance sheet partnerships used by Enron to hide debt were laced with acronyms and names taken from characters in the Star Wars series of movies. Noting that, House Oversight subcommittee Chairman James Greenwood, R-Pa., asked Powers was if Lay was ""the Luke Skywalker or the Darth Vader of Enron?""
       ""Well, he's not the Luke Skywalker, but he certainly is responsible,"" said Powers choking back a laugh.
       Powers said Lay approved the arrangements under which Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, created the partnerships and that the Enron chairman ""bears significant responsibility"" for not preventing the abuses that this ""inherent conflict of interest"" created.
       Powers said he was able to interview Lay for about four hours during the preparation of his report. ""I think he felt that he had not been watching carefully enough,"" Powers said of Lay's comments at the time. ""He felt like he had been betrayed and should have looked more carefully"" at the way business was being conducted, Powers said.
       Arthur Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino also appeared before House subcommittee to answer for his company's involvement in helping foist Enron's non-existent profits on an unsuspecting public. 
       Berardino's testimony took on the air of a school boy making contrition for some act of classroom mischief. He said the company was taking ""immediate steps"" to shore up public confidence, including the creation of a new internal office of ethics and compliance at Andersen. 
       But Berardino also sought to distance his company from the failings of Enron. 
       ""It is clear that something very tragic and disturbing happened at Enron,"" Berardino said. ""All involved with Enron must face up to what happened and take appropriate responsibility."" However, he said Enron did not provide critical information to its Andersen auditors about one of the partnership's arrangements with Barclays Bank of Britain, Berardino said. Had Andersen been given that information in 1997, he said, Andersen would have objected to Enron's accounting for the partnership.
       In addition, the Power's investigation ""did not speak to people at Andersen,"" Berardino told the House Financial Services panel. Suggestions that ""we did not cooperate with the investigation, nothing could be further from the truth.""
       However, Berardino later acknowledged that investigators working for Enron ""did talk to some of our people. ... Then they fired us. ... We begged them talk to us.""
       
The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.


Appearing Soon
Lawyer Says Ex-Enron Chief Will Appear; Lawmakers Rip Accountant
 

Feb. 5 - Faced with a pair of congressional subpoenas one day after angering lawmakers by his failure to testify at congressional hearings, former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay has now agreed to appear on Capitol Hill. 

This afternoon, the House Financial Services Committee sent a subpoena to Lay's lawyer, Earl Silbert, asking that Lay testify at a hearing on Feb. 14. Silber now says Lay will appear before Congress. 
Earlier today, the Senate Commerce Committee, the other panel spurned by Lay on Monday, voted unanimously to send its own subpoena to the former head of the failed energy firm. 
The House panel had attempted to serve Lay with a subpoena on Monday, but a committee spokeswoman said Silbert told them he could not accept it because he didn't know where Lay was. 
Kelly Kimberly, a spokeswoman for Lay, said this morning that Lay was currently in Houston, having flown back from Washington on a private aircraft Monday. 
But a subpoena cannot force the former head of Enron to talk. He could still exercise his Fifth Amendment rights and refuse to answer questions. 
Lay, who resigned as CEO on Jan. 23, announced Monday he was also resigning from Enron's board of directors, saying he did not want to be an unnecessary distraction for the now-bankrupt company. 
Andersen CEO in the Line of Fire 
Amid a wave of hearings on Enron in Congress this week, the House Financial Services Committee today grilled Joseph Berardino, CEO of Enron's now-fired accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. 
Berardino unveiled a series of proposed reforms for his firm and the accounting business in general, including a change from the current system in which an accounting firm simply approves a publicly held company's financial report. Instead, Berardino suggested that accountants give grades to the risks taken by the companies they audit. 
""The whole system needs to be looked at,"" said Berardino, who also proposed that it should be a felony to lie to or withhold facts from an accounting firm. He added, ""I'm embarrassed by what happened at my firm."" 
And in the face of repeated hostile questions from the committee, he sought to minimize Andersen's responsibility for Enron's murky financial practices, insisting Enron did not disclose crucial documents to top managers at Andersen. 
""Information was withheld from us,"" Berardino said. 
The October Surprise 
Andersen has been in the eye of the Enron storm since October, when Enron announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and declared it was worth $1.2 billion less than it had previously stated. Andersen, as Enron's auditor, had approved the earlier financial reports overstating the energy firm's worth. 
Enron had masked its large debts and losses by attributing them to investment partnerships that did not have to be included in the company's financial reports. Such partnerships can be kept off a company's books if outside firms own at least 3 percent of them. 
That was not the case for at least one of the Enron partnerships, Chewco, which was founded in 1997. Berardino has said Andersen only found out last fall that an outside investor did not own 3 percent of Chewco, thus making the arrangement a violation of accounting rules. 
Enron fired Andersen soon after the accounting firm's Jan. 10 admission that it had shredded documents pertaining to Enron last fall. 
At a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Monday, however, the prime topic was a highly critical internal report issued by members of Enron's board over the weekend. 
""What we found was appalling,"" testified William Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school, who co-authored the report with two other Enron board members. ""We found a systematic and pervasive attempt by Enron's management to misrepresent the company's financial condition."" 
Powers pointed a finger directly at Lay, as well as former Enron President and CEO Jeffrey Skilling, and cited ""misconduct"" by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and ""other senior employees"" who set up the company's undisclosed partnerships. Slightly less emphatically, he said the Enron board did not perform its watchdog role, noting, ""The board of directors failed in its duty to provide leadership and oversight."" 
Investigations Roll On 
In addition to questions about Enron's use of investment partnerships to hide its losses, seven congressional committees are holding hearings this week about issues of corporate governance, accounting standards, retirement plan reforms, and the Bush administration's many connections to the Houston-based company. 
The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee heard testimony this morning for former Enron employees who lost tens of thousands of dollars after the company went bankrupt. Enron's stock, which constituted the bulk of the 401(k) plans for many employees, is now virtually worthless. 
In addition to Congress' hearings, the Department of Justice is performing a criminal inquiry into the Enron case, while the Department of Labor and the Securities and Exchange Commission are also investigating. 
And with the release of the internal report, some members of Congress are increasingly suggesting that criminal charges could ultimately be pressed against some of the principals. 
Said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Energy Committee, ""Maybe somebody ought to go to the pokey for this.""

Lay, Former Enron CEO, Subpoenaed by Senate Panel
2002-02-05 13:45 (New York)

     Washington, Feb. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Kenneth Lay was subpoenaed by the Senate Commerce Committee to appear next week to explain the sudden collapse of Enron Corp. Lay's lawyer refused yesterday to accept a House subpoena ordering the former chairman to appear today, saying he couldn't locate him in time.
     An investigation sponsored by Enron's board and released this weekend said Enron executives enriched themselves while hiding at least $1 billion in losses from 3,000 partnerships. This morning Arthur Andersen LLP Chief Executive Officer Joseph Berardino urged Congress to enact tougher penalties for companies that mislead auditors, saying that's what Enron did.
     ""As we have learned painfully from the Enron experience, a company's failure to disclose important material to its auditor may have catastrophic consequences,'' Berardino said.
     The Senate Commerce Committee voted 23-0 to subpoena Lay to answer questions about the largest bankruptcy and the loss of about $850 million in pension funds.
     ""When you juxtapose what happened to the people at the bottom of Enron with those at the top, it really makes you sick,'' said Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat. ""We have no choice but to require a subpoena.''

Subpoena Refused

     Lay's lawyer late Sunday sent letters saying Lay wouldn't keep dates to appear yesterday and today before the Senate committee and a House Financial Services subcommittee. Attorney Earl Silbert cited ""inflammatory'' comments by members of the committee that he said were prejudicial to his client.
     Silbert yesterday refused to accept a subpoena requiring Lay to testify today because Lay was in Houston and Silbert said he didn't know how to reach him, committee aides said. ""He was unaware of his client's whereabouts,'' said Peggy Peterson, spokeswoman for the House Financial Services Committee.
      Lay's spokeswoman confirmed that Lay is in Houston. ""He's here looking after his ill father-in-law,'' Kelly Kimberly said.
     Lay, who just months ago was frequently visible on Houston's social circuit at political fund raisers and benefits for the United Way, the Holocaust Museum and the YMCA, is now in virtual seclusion in his condominium, located on the 33rd floor of a high-rise in Houston's River Oaks neighborhood.
     Lay and his wife Linda bought the unit in 1991. It was most recently valued at $7.11 million, according to the Harris County Central Appraisal District's Web site.

Little Expected

     Senators said today that even when compelled to appear, they don't expect Lay to answer questions.
     ""I'll bet you a dollar to a doughnut that Lay won't testify, that he'll invoke his Fifth Amendment right'' and decline to answer questions, said Senator John Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat.
""The American people need to know that lawmakers care about making sure this never happens again.''
     Dorgan said after the hearing that Lay and other witnesses called in the committee's inquiry wouldn't be given immunity from prosecution.
     Former Enron Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling is ""absolutely'' planning to testify before Congress on Thursday, his spokeswoman, Judy Leon said. Skilling isn't under a subpoena.
     ""He's voluntarily testifying in response to their invitation,'' she said. Asked where Skilling is, Leon said she wouldn't disclose his whereabouts.
     Senator Ernest Hollings, the committee's chairman, said Lay was one of President George W. Bush's biggest campaign donors and that the Enron affair represents ``a culture of corporate corruption and a culture of political corruption.''

Special Prosecutor Sought

     Yesterday Hollings called for a special prosecutor to take over the Justice Department's investigation of Enron. Hollings listed a number of Bush administration officials who he said had ties to Enron, including Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and budget director Mitch Daniels. Hollings said with so many links, a special prosecutor was needed.
     The Justice Department rejected that idea and today White House spokesman Ari Fleischer criticized Hollings. ``It is not helpful if a United States senator simply makes things up, such as he did about Mitch Daniels and Secretary O'Neill,'' Fleischer told reporters on Air Force One as Bush traveled to Pittsburgh.
     Bush later said Enron's collapse ""is a business problem and my Justice Department is going to investigate. And if there's wrongdoing, we'll hold them accountable.''
     During a tour of a laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Bush said members of Congress should focus on passing pension reform legislation. It ``will help protect workers and they ought to get after it,'' Bush told reporters.
     Yesterday Lay resigned from the board of the company he founded in 1985, saying it was in the ""best interests'' of former and current Enron employees and ``other stakeholders,'' according to a statement.
     William Powers Jr., the head of the Enron's internal special investigation, told a congressional panel yesterday that Lay and the rest of the board failed to halt ``a systematic and pervasive attempt'' by management to deceive investors about the energy dealer's finances.

Judge Allows Enron Creditors Group Access To Audit Papers

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal judge here agreed Tuesday to give bankrupt Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) official creditors committee access to audit information held by Arthur Andersen LLP.
The approval allows the 15-member committee to subpoena Enron-related paperwork dating back to 1995 and to depose Andersen executives. 
The creditors group, in court documents filed last month with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, said that a ""thorough examination"" of Enron's business dealings could shed light on the company's liabilities. 
""Further, the Committee is entitled to a complete examination of Andersen regarding the accounting irregularities disclosed by Enron and the resulting financial implication that in part precipitated the bankruptcy filing,"" according to the filing.

USA: Andersen CEO says Enron panel rebuffed auditor input.
By Kevin Drawbaugh

02/05/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - An Enron Corp. special board committee probing the energy trader's collapse ignored efforts by the company's long-time auditor Andersen to tell its side of the story, the chief executive of the Big Five accounting firm said on Tuesday. 
""We begged them to talk to us,"" said Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino in testimony before the congressional panel. ""This committee did not talk to us.""
As Congress continued intensive Enron hearings, Berardino's appearance before the House Financial Services capital markets subcommittee drew harsh questioning from lawmakers frustrated by a lack of detail in his remarks. 
""Your ship is going to go down and you're going to be lashed to the mast unless you start talking to us,"" said an angry New York Democratic Rep. Gary Ackerman. 
The hard-hitting Powers Report released on Saturday by the Enron special committee said Andersen was closely involved in the creation of a web of off-the-books partnerships Enron executives used to hide losses and enrich themselves. 
That web unraveled with amazing speed last fall, causing Enron to file the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history on Dec. 2, devastating investors and destroying thousands of jobs. 
Berardino said the special Enron board committee led by William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School, rebuffed Andersen's attempts to offer information. 
The chief of America's fifth-largest accounting firm said it knew about transactions involving the partnerships. ""We were aware of the transactions,' Berardino said. 
But contrary to the Powers report, he said Andersen did not help develop the partnerships. ""We did not help to establish. We reviewed the accounting that others developed,"" he said. 
Berardino repeatedly parried questions about who knew what and when at Andersen, pleading ignorance of exactly how Enron employees interacted with Andersen employees, some of whom destroyed thousands of Enron-related documents and e-mails. 
""There are a lot of facts we don't know,"" Berardino said. ""I apologize I can't answer a lot of those questions about what happened."" 
ANDERSEN, ENRON SPLIT UP 
Enron fired Chicago-based Andersen as its auditor on Jan. 17, ending a long relationship in which some Andersen accountants ended up working for Houston-based Enron. 
Andersen's involvement in the Enron affair has sullied the firm's reputation and those of other accountants, setting off a wave of concern in markets about financial reporting quality. 
Responding to market concerns, Berardino called for changes to the accounting industry in response to the Enron affair, which he called ""painful, but instructive."" 
He said U.S. accountants should drop their simplistic pass/fail corporate auditing system and replace it with more flexible quality grades. 
""I would suggest that we replace the current 'pass/fail' system with an auditor's report that grades the quality of the company's accounting practices,"" Berardino said. 
Berardino said companies should tell the public more about ""the imprecision of certain amounts in financial statements."" 
Echoing long-standing suggestions from others, he called for more disclosure of information about unusual events, segment and trend data and ""plain English"" reports. 
Touching on a sore point for Andersen, which has said it was left in the dark by Enron on certain questionable transactions, Berardino said, ""We should give serious thought to strengthening the penalties for misleading auditors."" 
He suggested ""making it a felony to lie, mislead or withhold information from the auditor."" 
Berardino also reiterated that Andersen will no longer accept assignments from publicly traded U.S. audit clients to design or implement financial reporting systems, or internal audit outsourcing engagements. 
He also said the firm would take internal steps to improve its auditing and that it has appointed former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to chair a committee charged with overhauling the firm's auditing practices.
ENRON 'WITHHELD' INFORMATION
Andersen reported the document destruction to the Justice Department when it became aware of it and is probing how it came about, the CEO said. 
""I'm embarrassed by what happened at my firm,"" Berardino acknowledged under questioning. He said efforts are underway to retrieve electronic documents that were destroyed.
As for Andersen's work to help Enron devise off-the-books partnerships, Berardino said ""we were aware of the transactions,"" but may not have known all the details. 
""Information was withheld,"" said Berardino. ""Who withheld it, we don't know."" 
Investigation is complicated by the fact that since Enron fired it, Andersen no longer has access to company documents, executives or employees, Berardino noted. 
Enron used numerous partnerships and special-purpose entities and kept them off its books thanks to accounting rules permitting that if outsiders invest 3% in the deals. 
Andersen initially opposed the so-called 3% rule, but failed to stop it, said Berardino. When advising Enron on such deals, ""we said 'no' a lot,"" he stressed. 
In one of Enron's off-the-books deals, Andersen made a bad call about whether it passed the 3% test, said Berardino, and in a second, he said auditors didn't realize it violated the 3% rule because they didn't have all the facts. If they had, he said Andersen would have objected to it and Enron wouldn't have had to restate earnings to reflect the error. 
Tougher rules for special-purpose entities may be in the cards, but Berardino said that won't prevent future problems, warning that clever accountants and lawyers can figure out how to get around new rules within days after the Financial Accounting Standards Board spends years devising them. 
Lawmakers praised Berardino for voluntarily appearing before the House panel for a second time, but he came in for sharp criticism from some quarters. 
Enron employees who lost their jobs and retirement savings when the company collapsed have seen their lives ""destroyed,"" in part because of Andersen's accounting work, charged Rep. Max Sandlin, D-Texas. 
Berardino rejected suggestions that Andersen caused Enron's demise. 
""At the end of the day, we do not cause companies to fail,"" he told lawmakers. He said Enron went bankrupt because it ""made bad business decisions.""

Enron Energy Trading Profits Shrank Months Before Bankruptcy
2002-02-05 11:23 (New York)

     Houston, Feb. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s earnings from energy trading withered in 2001, and the unit the company described as its most profitable may have been losing money months before it filed the largest-ever bankruptcy on Dec. 2, according to Enron documents and analysts.
     Enron's Wholesale Services unit reported third-quarter earnings rose to $696 million before interest and taxes, and its profit margin dropped to 1.6 percent, company documents show. The margin, or the ratio of profit to sales, doesn't include money borrowed to finance $2.8 billion in daily trading by EnronOnline, the company's Internet exchange.
     ""I can't see how this operation made any money with numbers like that before interest and taxes,'' said Cary Wasden, an analyst with Bellevue, Washington-based Reed Wasden & Associates, which provides investment recommendations on energy companies. Wasden told investors to sell Enron shares in March.
     Enron's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show energy-trading revenue rose 54 percent to $43.4 billion in the third quarter, the last period for which figures are available, from the year-earlier quarter.
     Former Enron Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling in July said the trading unit, which accounted for 97 percent of revenue in 2000, was ""dramatically expanding and profitable.''
     In the third quarter of 2000, Enron had $28.1 billion in revenue from trading and a profit of $627 million, or a 2.2 percent margin before interest and taxes.
     Houston-based Enron's other businesses, such as a water utility and a unit that traded space on fiber-optic networks, lost billions of dollars, according to company filings.

$1 Billion in Losses

     Enron also set up 3,000 affiliated partnerships to hide as much as $1 billion of losses, according to a report by William Powers, the University of Texas law school dean hired by Enron to investigate its finances.
     Some energy industry executives said Enron's losses may have been too large for any trading unit to overcome.
     ""They were all about volume,'' said Jeffrey Foose, managing director of commodity trading at PSE&G Energy Resources and Trade in Newark, New Jersey. ``It's the old joke that you make up for the losses in volume.''
     The company never supplied details on its trading, such as borrowing costs, that are needed to calculate the unit's profits. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer didn't respond to interview requests made by telephone seeking information about energy trading, profit margins and asset sales.

Borrowing Costs

     The company booked trading profits without fully accounting for the cost of borrowed money, said Ogan Kose, a former Enron oil trader. ""That made the operation seem more profitable than it was,'' he said.
     Enron's energy trading made a 1 percent profit after taxes and interest last year, estimated John Olson, a stock analyst at Houston-based investment adviser Sander Morris Harris Group Inc. Enron was capable, prior to bankruptcy, of generating $200 billion in annual revenue in coming years, Olson said.
     ""On $200 billion, that is still $2 billion in profit,'' Olson said.
     Enron executives such as former Chief Executive Officer Andrew Fastow and former General Manager Michael Kopper set up and ran affiliated partnerships backed with Enron stock to hide debt and operating losses, according to the Powers report.
     Some of the partnerships, such as LJM Management LLP, Chewco Investments LLP and Jedi Capital II, bought power plants and swapped debt and stock with Enron during the past two years, just as the profit margin from trading fell, a review of company filings shows.
     One partnership, called Whitewing Management LLP, bought 14 Enron power plants for $800 million in 1999, getting the money for the purchase by selling bonds backed by Enron shares.

Asset Sales

     Enron sold billions of assets from 1999 to 2001 to independent companies, sometimes at losses of 50 percent, according to company documents. In 1999, it sold a London power plant for $247 million after opening it 10 months earlier at a cost of $500 million. In 2001, Enron sold water company Azurix Corp. for $1.4 billion after paying $2.8 billion for it in 1998.
     University of San Diego finance and law professor Frank Partnoy, testifying before the Senate Government Affairs Committee, which is investigating Enron's bankruptcy, said, ""Most of what Enron represented as its core businesses were not making money.''

USA: Treasury's O'Neill-need more CEO accountability.

02/05/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, speaking as the Enron scandal unfolds, said on Tuesday the Bush administration would push for more accountability from corporate chieftains in a planned revamp of business disclosure requirements. 
""The key is accountability and responsibility for corporate officers and directors, accountants and auditors. We are committed to the president's call to hold corporate America to the 'highest standards of conduct,'"" O'Neill said in testimony prepared for delivery to the Senate Banking Committee.
""I am confident that the working group's recommendations will point the way to strengthening our disclosure regime,"" he said. 
The Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, have been charged by President George W. Bush with finding ways to close loopholes in the nation's corporate accounting system in the wake of the collapse for former energy trading giant Enron Corp. . 
O'Neill's remarks came a day after the Wall Street Journal reported the Treasury chief favored barring executives from using insurance to cover the costs of shareholder lawsuits. 
A ban on that type of insurance would be important ""so there is no ambiguity about the responsibility of executive officers - that they have a responsibility to know and a responsibility to share"" information with shareholders, the paper quoted O'Neill as saying. 
In his testimony on Tuesday, O'Neill also urged schools to take up financial literacy within the framework of teaching basic reading and math skills. 
""Teaching a child how to balance a checkbook reinforces basic addition and subtraction. Learning how to calculate compound interest provides an excellent way to exercise knowledge of percentages,"" he said.

Former Enron Executive's Suicide Note Sent to Attorney General
2002-02-05 15:25 (New York)

     Sugar Land, Texas, Feb. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Former Enron Corp. Vice Chairman John Clifford Baxter's suicide note was sent to the Texas Attorney General's Office for a ruling on whether it can be made public, a spokesman for the city of Sugar Land said.
     The attorney general has 55 days to make a decision, spokesman Doug Adolph said. The city, which made the request today, likely would release the note ""very quickly'' if it gets approval, he said.
     Baxter, 43, was found in his 2002 Mercedes-Benz at 2:23 a.m. on Jan. 25 with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. He was alone in the car, parked about a mile from his Sugar Land home, and a revolver was found near his body.
     The suicide note found at the scene said Baxter was distraught over Enron's collapse and the prospect of testifying against friends who worked there, CNBC reported the day of his death. Baxter resigned in May after a decade with Enron.
     The company is the subject of numerous shareholder lawsuits, as well as Congressional and criminal investigations, after filing the largest bankruptcy in corporate history in December.
     Sugar Land police continue to investigate Baxter's death, which was ruled a suicide by the Harris County Medical Examiner's Office. Police have said the contents of the note raise right-to-privacy questions under Texas law.

Enron may strike out in stadium deal
Houston Astros want to change name of ballpark

ASSOCIATED PRESS


HOUSTON, Feb. 5 -  The Astros want to shed the name of Enron Field. The baseball organization asked a federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Tuesday whether the whether the team should continue its Enron Field naming and license agreement with Enron Corp.

       ""THE HOUSTON ASTROS have been materially and adversely affected by the negative public perception and media scrutiny resulting from Enron's alleged bad business practices and bankruptcy,"" Astros vice president of business operations Pam Gardner said.
       The team filed a motion requesting guidance on the issue from the court overseeing Enron's bankruptcy proceedings.
       ""We have worked diligently with Enron to transition the stadium name, but we've been unsuccessful,"" Gardner said. ""At this point, we have no other alternative but to seek relief from the bankruptcy court."" 
       Enron paid $108,000 for a 14-person luxury suite on Jan. 22 as part of its deal with the Astros and paid nearly $90,000 for 35 season box seats on Monday, the team said.
       ""We speculate that the only reason that Enron continues to make these expenditures is that Enron believes it can sell the baseball stadium's naming rights to someone else without the consent of the Astros,"" Gardner said. ""In accordance with the terms of the agreement and by law, Enron cannot do this, and it is for this reason that we are asking the court to decide now whether the naming rights agreement should continue."" 
       In April 1999, the Astros and Enron agreed to a $100 million, 30-year contract. The Astros said the company has made three annual payments totaling $10.25 million and that $3.65 million is due Aug. 31.

USA: Houston Astros want Enron name off stadium.

02/05/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

HOUSTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The Houston Astros said Enron Corp. will not play ball with a plan to take the disgraced company's name off their stadium and filed a motion in bankruptcy court on Tuesday to have a judge make the call. 
The baseball team said the name ""Enron Field"" has hurt its image because of its association with the company's ""alleged bad business practices and bankruptcy.""
Enron, once the nation's largest energy trader but now a corporate pariah, agreed in 1999 to pay $100 million to put its name on the stadium, then still under construction, for 30 years. 
The company's former chairman, Ken Lay, threw out the ceremonial first pitch when Enron Field opened in 2000. 
Now, the Astros want to buy out the agreement and rename the stadium, but Enron has refused, said Pam Gardner, the team's president of baseball operations. 
She said Enron has spent nearly $200,000 since filing for bankruptcy in December to keep up the naming rights agreement by buying seats and suites required under the deal. A payment of $3.7 million is due in August, Gardner said. 
She believes the company wants to sell the stadium name to someone else without the Astros' consent. 
""Enron cannot do this and it is for this reason that we are asking the court to decide now whether the naming rights agreement should continue,"" Gardner said in a statement. 
""We do not believe that it is appropriate for Enron to continue to spend these large sums of money to have a baseball stadium named after it,"" she said. 
An Enron spokesman was not immediately available for comment.

02/05/2002
Fox News: The O'Reilly Factor
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.

BILL O'REILLY, HOST: Hi, I'm Bill O'Reilly, thanks for watching us tonight. 
First of all, congratulations to the New England Patriots, who through sheer hard work and determination are the Super Bowl champs, great game.
Why did heavily favored St. Louis lose? We'll tell you later on in the most ridiculous segment. It's something few have pointed out. 
""Talking Points"" memo this evening is about the growing Enron scandal. Even if you don't care about the stock market or economics, you should pay attention to this story, because this goes to the heart of our justice system. We all know the rich and powerful can do things that everyday Americans cannot do. They can buy justice, dodge probing questions, and generally get away with a lot more than you can. 
That's not fair, but that's the way America is. We are a society built on money. And money buys privilege, even when it comes to crime. 
Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay canceled his appearance in front of a congressional committee today, his lawyer saying Mr. Lay would not be given a fair hearing. But the real reason Lay didn't show up is that he's a rank coward, a man who sold $100 million worth of Enron stock before it tanked but who told his employees two months before bankruptcy to buy the stock. 
Lay also hid behind his wife's skirt when she showed up on the ""Today"" show to tell America the family was broke. Yeah, sure. 
The truth is that Enron was run by dishonest cowards who committed fraud and hoped their political connections would save them. What can you say about Enron vice chairman Cliff Baxter? He commits suicide knowing he has a wife and two children sleeping at home. Nice. 
And another Enron CEO, Jeffrey Skilling, cashing in his chips for $67 million before the fall. The list goes on and on. 
There is no question that Enron tried to buy political pull, and in the rotten campaign finance system we have, the company was able to give big money to both parties. Democrats are trying to tie the Enron rock to Bush-Cheney, but after DNC chief Terry McAuliffe's Global Crossing bonanza, that will not be so easy. 
All these power guys take corporate money, and most of them get inside information from the big business chieftains. Again, it's not right, but unless the feds set up an ethics police, the Beltway ain't gonna change. 
The end zone here is this, millions of Americans trusted the Enron Corporation to be honest and the company was not. So the executives of the company must stand trial. If convicted, they should go to prison and pay massive fines. 
By the way, here's Kenneth Lay's leisure resume, $7 million in Houston, private plane, two homes and property in Aspen, Colorado, currently for sale, price $15 million. And at least 10 other properties in Texas. Mrs. Lay was lucky she chose the ""Today"" show. Peddling her line of bull here would have been quite a different story. 
And that's the memo. 
Now for the ""Top Story"" tonight, two others views of the Enron situation. First here in the studio, Fox News senior business correspondent Terry Keenan. And ""Forbes.com"" editor and lawyer Dan Ackman. 
Now, when we last left Terry, she was placing some of the onus on stock -- on people who bought the stock, saying you shouldn't buy what you don't know. OK, and I agree with that. But... 
TERRY KEENAN, ""CASHIN' IN"" HOST: You shouldn't put 100 percent of your net worth into the stock, either, especially if you don't know what... 
O'REILLY: OK. Everybody knows that. But everybody doesn't know what their pension plans are invested in, what their mutual funds are invested in, and they're trusting that these things will go at least in an honest way. 
I can't imagine either of our two guests objecting to the most stringent Justice Department investigation. You (UNINTELLIGIBLE). 
KEENAN: Yes, these guys should go to jail if they indeed perpetrated the fraud that it looks like they did. That's what happened in the late '80s when Rudy Giuliani got on the white collar criminals down on Wall Street, and a lot of that shenanigans stopped. Nothing happened during the 1990s, and look what we got. 
O'REILLY: All right. What did you think of Mrs. Lay going on saying they didn't have any money, that she -- they're the victims? What did you think? 
KEENAN: I mean, come on. First of all, if he's going -- if he's going to talk, he should go out and talk and not do -- not have... 
O'REILLY: Right. That's cowardly, right? 
KEENAN: ... his wife do the talking. I think so, yes. 
O'REILLY: And then what she said? 
KEENAN: I mean, we've seen it before. The ""Today"" show has a long tradition of that, Hillary Rodham Clinton... 
O'REILLY: Yes, she did the same thing, right. 
KEENAN: ... among them. But come on, I mean, the kids are on the payroll, all sorts of inner dealings with Mr. Lay's son Mark revealed, all sorts of things going on, and they spin the properties, and... 
O'REILLY: All right. So you're taking... 
KEENAN: ... in terms of... 
O'REILLY: ... a hard approach now, Miss Keenan, right? You're not deflecting it any more like you did the first time. And not to say that you didn't see the wrongdoing, but you were very, very intense, and FACTOR viewers will remember this, and so was Cavuto, about, Well, it -- you know, the people should know what they're investing in. 
KEENAN: I still think you got to look at the red flags, because life isn't perfect. We were in a huge mania for stocks in a bubble economy, particularly for the tech stocks. You got to look at the red flags. This was a year-long train wreck. It took a year for this Enron stock... 
O'REILLY: Yes, but they still kept lying, they... 
KEENAN: ... to go from (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
O'REILLY: ... still kept lying. 
KEENAN: ... 250 days to look at some of the flags... 
O'REILLY: And -- all right, but... 
KEENAN: ... and maybe sell out... 
O'REILLY: ... all of the experts, all the brokerage houses, buy, buy, buy. How do you see this, counselor? 
DAN ACKMAN, STAFF EDITOR, ""FORBES.COM"": Well, one of the things about, you know, saying that people should have known is that when you hear about these scandals where people call up on the phone, people they don't know, and they say, Buy this stock that you've never heard of, and some people do, and you're amazed that anyone does. But when it's your own boss telling you to buy the stock... 
O'REILLY: Yes. 
ACKMAN: ... the owner of your own company, it's another story. And I think people have some justification for believing the lies... 
O'REILLY: Well, here's my -- here's my problem. I'm, I got my account with Merrill Lynch. OK? I think many Americans... 
ACKMAN: Merrill Lynch is another problem. 
O'REILLY: ... have big brokerage houses. 
KEENAN: Yes, and that's not (UNINTELLIGIBLE). 
O'REILLY: OK, and I do it for convenience and because the -- my broker's a good guy, and I've trusted him, been a long time. Now, I look -- I don't believe Merrill Lynch per se, in a sense, when they say, you know, buy, I don't buy all the time. But I do believe that they're smart enough to know when a company's fraudulent or not. 
Merrill Lynch had a buy on this damn thing about two months before it went down. 
KEENAN: And their executives were... 
ACKMAN: It was more, it was more, it was less... 
KEENAN: ... invested in their partnerships... 
ACKMAN: It is less than two months before... 
KEENAN: ... in secret partnerships. 
ACKMAN: ... like, two weeks before... 
O'REILLY: Yes. 
ACKMAN: ... it went down. And Terry's right, they had their -- they were raising a lot of money for Enron, as was everyone else on Wall Street. Enron raised billions of dollars in the years before they went bankrupt, and that's probably why, I mean, a lot of people say that the Wall Street system of analysts is totally corrupt, and Enron is a case in point. 
O'REILLY: Do you believe, counselor, that the Wall Street system of analysts are totally corrupt? Do you believe that? 
ACKMAN: I, I, I, I don't know if I would say they're totally corrupt. But when 12 out of 13 analysts are saying, Buy this stock, and then you talk to them afterwards and you say, What did this company do? and they don't know, and you say, What did -- how did the company book its revenues? and they don't know, that's a joke, and that's... 
O'REILLY: All right. So what... 
ACKMAN: ... that's corrupt. 
O'REILLY: ... what you're saying is, we need a complete overhaul here about how our financial systems are run. 
ACKMAN: Well, I think you're right, people should probably -- as of now, shouldn't be listening to sale-side analysts. They should be looking elsewhere for their advice. They were... 
O'REILLY: Elsewhere? 
ACKMAN: Well, there are newsletters and other... 
O'REILLY: Oh, they're a bunch of crap, most of those newsletters. 
ACKMAN: Oh, no, they're actually -- some of the newsletters actually did call Enron pretty early on. 
O'REILLY: Not many. 
Now, Terry, the situation here is that we have an investigation by Congress, which doesn't mean very much. All right? And the Justice Department, who knows? I mean, if it -- if the Marc Rich investigation is any setup, you know, who knows whether... 
KEENAN: Yes, who knows, and we're playing with fire here. The Dow is down 220 points today because a lot of people are saying, Hey, we can't believe a lot of these other numbers, and therefore we're going to sell now, we'll ask questions later. And we're not... 
O'REILLY: Right, because we got... 
KEENAN: ... going to be a victim again. 
O'REILLY: ... we got Global Crossing, right? We got Tyco, they're in trouble too, right? 
KEENAN: WorldCom down very sharply today. 
O'REILLY: What did WorldCom do now? 
KEENAN: Well, they have a pattern that's very similar to Enron. And I'm not saying that there's any fraud involved, but they... 
O'REILLY: So the people are scared. 
KEENAN: ... were acquiring a lot of companies with their stock. Every time you acquire something, you write off something, no one knows what's there. 
O'REILLY: Do you believe as the counselor does that the analysis is corrupt on Wall Street? 
KEENAN: The analysis is beyond corrupt. This situation with Enron is a can of worms that is way bigger than I even expected. And the situation with Merrill Lynch, the executives were investing in these secret partnerships. Congress, reporters, no one knows who else were in those partnerships. One reporter discovered that Merrill executives were part of these secret partnerships. 
Who was the head of the partnership? The CFO. Who decides what business is going to Merrill Lynch? The CFO. The conflicts are just mind-boggling. 
O'REILLY: All right. So what I'm hearing from both of you is that we need a total overhaul, and, and a -- probably a new federal agency, because the SEC doesn't seem to have a clue, to monitor this financial, you know, colossus that we have in this country. 
ACKMAN: Well, I'm not sure if you need a total overhaul. I don't know if most companies do anything close to what Enron did. I mean, I'm saying Enron is the only... 
O'REILLY: But Enron thought they could get away with it. They thought they could get (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... 
ACKMAN: Well, they thought they could get away with it. But, I mean, ultimately they didn't. I mean, they -- a lot of people lost money, but I think people will go to jail, as Terry said. 
O'REILLY: All right. Thank you both for being here. We appreciate it. Of course, we'll stay on the story. 
And coming next, a Super Bowl commercial bought with taxpayer money ties drug use to terrorism. Is that fair? Right back with that debate.

Risky business
How did Enron break into the elite Wall Street world of bankruptcy insurance?
- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Damien Cave, Salon.com
Feb. 5, 2002 | Congressional investigations, class-action lawsuits, campaign contributions and 401K reform.  Paper shredding, books cooking and wives crying for ""Today Show"" cameras. 
Enron's collapse has generated so many huge stories that it's been easy to miss one of the most ironic and self-revealing of all its myriad ventures. Enron, now famous for the largest corporate bankruptcy in American history, was also a big player in the relatively new market for buying and selling bankruptcy protection. 
Enron's whiz kids dabbled in a wide variety of high-finance maneuvers. But its presence in the market for what are technically called ""credit derivatives"" was eye-opening -- or should have been, to anyone paying attention. The credit derivative game is dominated primarily by huge banks -- just seven institutions handle 96 percent of the multibillion-dollar business. 
With good reason. Credit derivatives are designed to minimize risk. They are, in their simplest form, insurance policies on other assets. By buying a credit derivative, a bank, for instance, will pay another entity to assume the risk of a loan that it fears will not be paid back. If its hunch proves correct, the seller of protection will have to cover the loan. Since credit derivatives carry the potential for sudden, huge payouts, buyers rarely want to purchase credit derivatives from a risky provider. So sellers tend to be big and rich enough to handle large defaults without going bankrupt. 
So what was a supposed energy trader from Texas doing in a market that epitomized Wall Street? According to derivatives experts, the Houston company bluffed and cajoled its way to the table, pretending to be bigger and more stable than it really was. At the same time, it used its formidable lobbying power in Washington to ensure that federal oversight over precisely this type of market was to all practical purposes nonexistent, and then proceeded to screw it up on a vast scale. 
Operating without a net -- or a watchdog -- Enron trotted into one of the world's most complex financial arenas and made a colossal, billion dollar mess, inserting risk into a market designed specifically to avoid it. According to Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, Enron's collapse has thrown at least $3 billion worth of credit derivatives contracts into limbo. So far, Enron's bankruptcy hasn't set off a wider financial panic, but according to some experts, the credit derivatives fiasco nevertheless reveals larger systemic problems. The company's push into credit derivatives not only proves that it's possible to dupe some of the best financial minds in the world, but it also exposes potentially dangerous loopholes in the U.S.'s financial regulatory system. The SEC regulates the investment banks that typically dominate credit derivative trading. But Enron wasn't a bank -- so it escaped supervision. 
Because derivatives markets are easy to enter and disclosure rules are weak, some experts believe that it's only a matter of time before another rogue derivatives player surfaces, fails and sends even greater shock waves through the system. 
""There are other potential time bombs ticking,"" says Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of trading and markets at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). ""We don't know how many other companies like Enron are out there."" 
The term ""derivatives"" is used to describe a class of financial contracts that are derived from another asset and priced according to that asset's value. Also known as a form of ""risk management,"" over the past 20 years derivatives trading has become increasingly popular on Wall Street as a way to ""hedge"" risk; to protect yourself from an investment bet that goes sour or from swings in interest rates or currency prices. Over the course of those 20 years, the debate on whether to regulate such trading has been one of the more abstruse battlegrounds between Washington and Wall Street -- and Enron has been a major player in that fight. 
One of the first derivatives to gain popularity in the newly deregulated financial markets of the 1980s was the ""interest-rate swap,"" which takes its value from underlying loans. Interest-rate swaps allow a bank that has, for example, a majority of variable rate loans to protect against the risk of falling interest rates -- which would decrease borrowers' payments and thus bank profits -- by ""swapping"" the loans for fixed rate debts held by another bank. The actual loans never change hands; the contract allows the banks to trade only the interest-rate risks, with the price of the deal being determined by the size of the loans and the probability of interest-rate fluctuations. If it looks like the Federal Reserve will raise rates, the fixed-rate bank will pay a higher premium. But if the Fed signals a cut, the bank with a high level of variable rate loans will pay a larger fee. 
New kinds of derivatives are constantly being dreamed up by everyone from Nobel Prize laureates to MBAs fresh from the finest business schools. It is hardly an exaggeration to call derivatives the cutting edge of capitalism, the fanciest way humans have yet devised to gamble for big bucks. Credit derivatives, specifically, are one of the more recent products of this high-finance drive to innovate. For a company like Enron, which considered itself able and willing to trade anything, bankruptcy protection was just another commodity. 
Dreamed up about 10 years ago in order to protect banks from risky borrowers, credit derivatives extended the concept of risk trading to all forms of credit risk, not just interest rates. They grew from a simple mix of reality and logic: ""When you have a portfolio of loans, some are strong and some are weak,"" says Kathryn Dick, director of treasury and market risk for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a division of the Federal Reserve. ""Trying to keep a good balance, that's what started the thinking that became credit derivatives."" 
Large investment banks, led by J.P. Morgan, began to tout the idea in the early '90s. The first ""products"" focused specifically on bank loans. ""Credit default swaps,"" for example, gave a bank in the Midwest that had mostly manufacturing loans -- which are especially sensitive to business cycles -- the ability to insure its debt by paying a New York bank to take on the risk of default. If the borrower couldn't pay, the New York bank ponied up the cash. 
Each player in this equation has an incentive to make a deal. The mediator, or trader, bringing both sides together picks up a percentage of the price paid; the firm buying protection gains the ability to extend more credit without holding onto the risk, while the firm selling protection brings in extra cash by agreeing to cover for loans that it thinks it won't have to cover. 
Banks also enjoy other advantages from the use of credit derivatives. If a bank sells a loan to another bank -- an older way to get rid of risk -- it then must inform the borrower that the loan has been picked up by another party. But because credit derivatives are not actual assets but rather meta-level contracts, lenders can keep the loans on their books without telling borrowers what's going on behind the scenes. 
""One of the reasons that banks like credit derivatives is because of the way that the financial world has evolved,"" says Dick. ""Banks now have very large corporate clients. They don't want to keep all of that exposure, but they want to maintain a relationship with the client. Credit derivatives let them do that."" 
Even with these incentives, many banks at first hesitated to buy or sell protection on their own loans, bonds or other securities. The pricing models were untested. The laws surrounding the new product remained murky. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission had exempted credit derivatives and other swaps from federal oversight in 1993, but because each contract was tailor-made to the deal at hand (instead of traded on a formal or over-the-counter exchange), the language of the contracts tended to vary too much for the bankers' tastes. It wasn't clear what would hold up in court in the case of a ""credit event"" like a bankruptcy. 
""The problem with the market then [in the mid-'90s] was that the contracts were all different,"" says Mickey Mandelbaum, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, which began researching credit derivatives in 1994. ""There was a big joke that the busiest person on the derivatives desk was the lawyer."" 
Big investment banks eventually managed to standardize the contracts. J.P. Morgan and Credit Suisse launched credit derivatives products lines in 1997. Others followed, and in 1999 the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), the industry's trade group, issued formal rules. The market began to quickly swell. In 1997, $55 billion in debt was covered by credit derivatives contracts; by the fourth quarter of 1999, that figure topped $287 billion. 
The massive run-up spawned a recapitulation of age-old debates. Proponents of financial innovation argue that products like credit derivatives are nothing less than tools of progress -- market-oriented weapons that protect against instability and risk. But critics contend that new, untested markets always give con men and unscrupulous wheeler-dealers more room to hide. 
Altogether, by the end of 1997, derivatives contracts represented more than $25 trillion in real assets. The question of whether the government should regulate the market or let it grow, untethered by red tape, began to heat up, fueled by some high-profile derivatives failures. 
""Congress started saying that we need to regulate this stuff,"" recalls Greenberger, who was then the director of trading and markets at the CFTC. ""Dingell [Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., a ranking member of the House Commerce Committee] wanted to introduce legislation creating a derivatives exchange."" 
Enter Enron. The energy trader was fast leaving behind its commodity trading and delivery roots, and moving ever more aggressively into the world of pure finance. Enron, unsurprisingly, opposed the formalization of derivatives regulation. In April 1993, aggressive Enron lobbying had encouraged the CFTC to grant a broad exemption to the trading of energy derivatives, in which electricity dealers and wholesalers sign contracts that let both sides hedge against future price swings. But energy derivatives were just one front on which Enron's executives were advancing. 
""They had an exciting agenda,"" said one East Coast finance professor who did some consulting for the company. Some of the brightest minds in finance and risk management wanted to work with Enron because, he said, ""they were trying to move forward."" 
Wall Street also opposed derivatives legislation, but for slightly different reasons. The big banks argued that new laws would be too costly. Derivatives were not like the futures contracts used to lock in prices on grain and other commodities, they argued, so the CFTC should leave them alone. The SEC seemed willing to go along. 
There was one dissenting voice. Brooksley Born, a Clinton appointee who became the head of the CFTC in 1996, refused to accept the industry's stance. ""In late 1997 and early 1998, she said the emperor has no clothes,"" says Greenberger. ""She said that derivatives are futures contracts and that the CFTC had jurisdiction."" 
On May 7, in a 62-page report, the CFTC announced that changes in the derivatives market ""require the commission to review its regulations."" Born called for public comment and hearings. 
But Enron refused to buckle. Protests from Wall Street's major players drew more attention than Enron's opposition, but a July 4, 1998, Washington Post article revealed that Enron was forging ahead at that very moment in an attempt to create an entirely new market for ""weather derivatives"" -- in which contracts on energy supplies would be dependent on bets as to whether the weather was hot or cold. Such contracts would be exactly the kind of new product that CFTC regulators would likely examine. 
A handful of legislators, including Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, kept the forces of regulation at bay. For Gramm, derivatives deregulation was a family affair: His wife, Wendy Gramm, chairwoman of the CFTC from February 1988 to January 1993, had earlier shepherded through the exemption that (in April 1993) let Enron trade energy derivatives without federal oversight. (A few months after passage of the exemption, she quit the CFTC and took a seat on Enron's board of directors.) Enron also found a set of allies in the U.S. Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the SEC. All three agencies, though headed by Born's fellow Clinton appointees, scorned the new CFTC proposal. They even issued a rare joint statement declaring that ""we have grave concerns about this action and its possible consequences. We seriously question the scope of the CFTC's jurisdiction in this area."" 
Congress, caught in the middle of a regulatory turf war that involved some of the country's most generous campaign donors, also declined to show interest in regulation. It maintained this stance even as, in September 1998, the huge hedge fund Long Term Capital Management warned the Fed that, in part because of its derivatives strategy, it was about to go under -- and threatened to drag several major banks down with it. 
But despite the link between LTCM and derivatives, calls for regulation fell on deaf ears. After organizing a bailout of LTCM, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan -- along with SEC chairman Arthur Levitt; William J. Rainer, Born's replacement at the CFTC; and Lawrence Summers, secretary of the treasury -- penned a 42-page report that favored less, rather than more regulation. 
Congress followed suit, passing the Commodity Futures Modernization Act in December 2000. 
""The CFMA made it clear that this kind of trading would be exempted,"" Greenberger says. ""Only a handful of congressmen and senators probably realized that they were enacting this deregulatory provision."" 
Brooksley Born ""had it just right,"" and should be considered a hero, adds Martin Mayer, a finance expert and author of more than a dozen books on the U.S. banking system. ""The whole political establishment, from Rubin and Greenspan and Levitt and Phil Gramm, turned on her."" 
And Enron forged on, stepping up its involvement in derivatives markets dramatically. The company's spokespeople failed to return calls for comment; Born also refused to comment because her law firm now represents several Enron creditors. But observers argue that the CFMA essentially let Enron move forward with its plan to aggressively court derivatives buyers and sellers. 
By the end of 2000, a year after the launch of Enron's Web-based trading site EnronOnline, the company's derivatives business had more than quintupled in a single year. Assets increased from $2.2 billion to $12 billion; derivative-related liabilities increased from $1.8 billion to $10.5 billion. 
It's not clear how much of this growth came from credit derivatives, although S&P's finding of $3.3 billion in exposure at Enron suggests that it played a major role. But regardless, Frank Partnoy, a law professor at the University of San Diego who cited Enron's derivative growth figures in testimony before Congress on Jan. 24, argues that Enron should never have been able to become such a powerful derivatives player. The financial and government institutions that protect the financial markets shouldn't have let the company gain so much as a foothold, he says. 
""The collapse of Enron makes plain that the key gatekeeper institutions that support our system of market capitalism have failed,"" he told the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. ""The institutions sharing the blame include auditors, law firms, banks, securities analysts, independent directors and credit rating agencies."" 
Specifically, Partnoy argues that the derivatives market is too easy to penetrate because all that's required is ""credit worthiness and decent reputation."" If one of the nation's three credit-rating agencies -- Moody's, Standard & Poor's or Fitch IBCA -- give a company an investment grade rating, it can essentially act like J.P. Morgan Chase or Citigroup, two of the world's biggest banks. But Enron was able to offer credit without being required to keep a set amount of capital in place, as banks are. And whereas traders dealing with securities or futures contracts must pass difficult licensing exams, companies that trade only in derivatives often can do as they please. 
Enron managed to become a major player in the derivatives market not just by taking advantage of these loopholes. The company also built up its reputation through a mix of deceit, hobnobbing and bravado. Its high credit rating was maintained by hiding billions of dollars of debt in off-balance sheet partnerships. Its gravy train included prominent economists, politicians and journalists. By dint of ceaseless self-promotion, executives like Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling made Enron's name synonymous with successful financial innovation. 
Investment bankers now speak with derision of Enron's arrogant attempt to invade the turf of the big boys. And many in the investment community are quick to separate themselves from Enron's taint. The fault for Enron's collapse lies with Enron, they argue -- not the lack of regulation. The company gamed the system and paid the price. New rules, they stress, would only punish the innocent companies with higher costs and more red tape. The lesson of Enron's collapse is not that government needs to save the markets from themselves, but rather that bad companies fail, says Nik Khakee, director of Standard & Poor's structured finance derivatives group. 
""Some people would argue that it's good for there to be more players in the derivatives market, but you need to make sure that they're all operating under an accepted set of rules,"" he says. Enron, he implied, made up its own rules. 
Proponents of credit derivatives, in particular, dismiss the idea that Enron's fall has any larger systemic importance. Enron's derivatives will simply be redistributed, they argue. In fact, Enron's involvement with credit derivatives should be seen as ""a bright spot,"" according to William Harrison, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, who defended them on Jan. 16, according to a Financial Times report. Without credit derivatives, Harrison and others have argued, Enron's $33 billion debt default would have been more highly concentrated, forcing banks that had a direct relationship with Enron to lose massive amounts of money, or close. 
In other words, credit derivatives make the system more stable, so as to prevent disruption when events as catastrophic as Enron's failure happen. But not everyone shares this view. Enron may not create a chain reaction of economic disruption by itself, but if dozens of companies engage in the same kind of practices, free from any kind of government oversight, a series of failures could threaten to undermine even the most stable banks and financial firms, Partnoy, Greenberger and others argue. 
Clarifying disclosure rules may not even be enough to protect against another Enron, according to Greenberger. ""You need to have some sort of regulatory structure,"" he says, noting that banks have federal examiners in-house. ""You can debate what kind of structure to put in place, but you need stronger enforcement because financial statements are not going to protect the public from imprudent, unsound or fraudulent practices."" 
Ultimately, as Partnoy pointed out in his testimony, ""Congress must decide whether, after 10 years of steady deregulation, the post-Enron derivatives markets should remain exempt from the regulation that covers all other investment contracts."" 
As Partnoy noted in his Senate testimony, the gatekeepers failed, and their continued failure may set the stage for even greater economic distress. Enron's derivatives adventures, ultimately, leave us with one major, and as yet unanswered, question. Who will guard the gatekeepers?

Silver lining in the Enron cloud
Terry Bedford, CNBC, 02/05/02
It may not seem like it, but the Enron accounting scandal may eventually lead to very good things on Wall Street. 

One of the things that most small investors fail to realize is that most Wall Street brokerage firms make the lion's share of their revenues by providing merchant banking and other corporate finance services to leading corporations. I'm not suggesting for a second that there is anything wrong in doing so, merely stating a fact.

The problem is that these same Wall Street brokers also make recommendations to the public to buy the stocks and bonds of the very same firms with which they have banking relationships. OK, I know the Wall Street line: ""there is no conflict of interest because the banking and brokerage sides of the business are independent."" But when is the last time you saw a firm recommending that investors reduce exposure to a stock with which they had a banking relationship?

What we all need to understand is that Wall Street brokerage firms don't work for individual investors. They work for the big corporations from which they are trying to earn banking fees.

Now here is the tie to Enron. As we all know, evidence is beginning to point to the fact that at least some parts of the accounting community may also be ""in the pocket"" of corporate America. If you are like me, you are hoping that perhaps the outcry over Enron will be sufficient to make the politicians finally do something about these conflicts of interest. 

Of course, I'm not na?ve. I know that the politicians don't exactly have clean hands when it comes to doing the bidding of leading corporations. But as I said, I'm hoping that some good may come of the Enron mess.

Market faces crisis
Meanwhile, there is a crisis of confidence in the stock market. Investors are doing what they always do when they are nervous; they are selling first and asking questions later. They will continue to do this until the Enron mess ""goes away"". And therein lies the problem.

At least at this time, politicians are ensuring that Enron will not go away anytime soon. Let's count the ways. First, Vice President Dick Cheney is refusing to hand over documents regarding energy policy meetings with Enron executives. I know Cheney says it is a matter of principle and he may have a point, but he is prolonging the scandal and forcing responsible reporters to look to a political link to what is most likely a corporate governance issue. 

Second, various House and Senate Finance committee members continue to squawk on weekend talk shows about possible ""criminal charges"" at Enron. This virtually assures Enron executives will remain silent. Silence leads to uncertainty and innuendo -- and, of course, that leads to selling.

You can see where all of this is leading. It's like the various Clinton scandals, the presidential election mess and every other political crisis of the past two decades. As long as the crisis continues, stock prices will move lower. At least at this time, I don't see an easy way out for bulls. 

As for the technical picture, it could not be worse. There was a kickback rally late last week, but even as resistance levels were felled, volume declined. Wall Street analysts were out pounding the table with new ""buy"" recommendations -- but we are all know where their loyalty is. In short, the move higher last week was a classic sucker rally -- and you can bet that in the very near future, there will be talk of a test of the September lows.

In the short term, I will continue to play the game. Right now, the rules of that game are any firm with perceived questionable accounting practices is going to be branded with a scarlet letter ""E"" for Enron. It's not fair, but nobody said Wall Street was fair.

And where do you find potential ""guilt by association"" short-sale candidates? That's easy; look for every fast-growing firm where bears have at one time questioned accounting. Also look for firms where the chief financial officer has recently resigned.

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring

"FW: ETOCO bid - Intrastate pipes","
Brian, I asked Shauywn to send this to me as it shows that the rate HPL gave us for transport and the price they are apparently giving to ETOCO is  close to .19 apart (although the current contract they have w/ ETOCO is in evergreen so the producer may be in for a rude awakening from HPL soon)....let me know if you want to discuss more. Thanks.

Subject:	ETOCO bid - Intrastate pipes

Jill,
Per your request, below are the details of my interactions with ETOCO Inc.

On September 10th I spoke to Walter Cochran at Etoco and have the following notes from that conversation:
Friendly - they're moving most of their gas on HPL, most was 1-year term that has gone to evergreen and going month to month.  They dont do much hedging or other ""fancy stuff"", just simple gas contracts: [1] 5 miles north of San Jacinto Monument; 11,000/d (and expect that to increase) on HPL; getting HSC-.05  [2] west side, meter outside of Sealy; 4500-6000/d on HPL; getting HSC-.155 (getting dinged because of CO2 in gas)  [3] North of Deer Park, Jacinto Port; 7000/d on Kinder Morgan; getting 97% of HSC.  They'd definitely entertain bids on the gas, but dont know what we can do with HPL moving it.  He deals with John Payton at HPL.

They have a 30 day notice they have to give to get out of their current contract.  Also, he said they'd take a few weeks to make a decision to switch anyway.  Compare our price/bid to what they're getting and then see if we're competitive enough to pursue a contract with them.

He gave me this to bid on --> 10,500/day; Sralla road field, feeds into HPL; 2 meters (Etoco Highlands pipeline meter # 0989758-10 - 9000/day here) and (Etoco Hargrove Central point meter # 0989651 - 1500/day here).  I offered bid of HSC - .24

Today (October 18) I followed up with him on how our bid fared since I hadn't ever heard back from him.  He was friendly about it, but when I asked if we were close or on another planet, he said, ""another planet"".  We were off by 19 cents.   They dont really have anything on interstate pipes either, so doubtful any reason for us to continue bidding here.  He would like to keep in touch in case anything changes down the road.


Let me know if you need additional info.
Shauywn

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines In Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidity --- Firm Will Pay Debt, Keep Cash Cushion
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John R. Emshwiller, Rebecca Smith and Jathon Sapsford

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity. 
Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong. But, ""when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank,"" said an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, ""we are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."" 
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involved in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit. 
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday. 
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor's, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several notches. 
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. Together with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade rating would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of existing shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down six cents at $16.35. 
Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes more than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enron's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999. 
The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by underperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, particularly in today's slower economy. 
The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies that have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealings with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents related to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as much as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclosed its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other employee-related entity known as Chewco. 
Chewco was established in 1997 ""with approximately $400 million in capital commitments"" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the partnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a managing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the document. 
Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with employee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any comment regarding its dealings with Chewco. 
Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping to run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In response to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that ""Michael Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron."" Mr. Fastow repeatedly has declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partnerships in July. 
This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regarding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to report any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves ""any director or executive officer."" By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumably wouldn't have. 
However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a ""material"" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents in charge of major business units and ""other persons who perform similar policy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of management.""

Deals & Deal Makers: Enron Officials Sell Shares Amid Stock-Price Slump

Officials at Enron Corp., whose unusual transactions with its chief financial officer are under regulatory scrutiny, have steadily sold sizable amounts of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this year. 
Corporate officials had sold 1.8 million shares valued at about $106 million through July, as the stock fell to less than $45 a share from $83 at the start of the year. Since July, the stock has plummeted an additional 63% to $16.35, including a 50% plunge since the beginning of last week.
Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company, cashed in shares for $25.7 million so far this year, usually in transactions paired with options exercises. He sold 429,614 shares, leaving him with some 2.8 million shares as of July, the latest data available on his sales, according to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics. 
The dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all Mr. Lay's sales of Enron shares for 2000, which reached $30.7 million. In 1999, he sold shares for a total of $26 million. 
In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate officials. Enron also wouldn't comment on the number of options held by company insiders and called the sales ""a personal decision."" Many sales by Enron insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon after option exercises. 
Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines should raise red flags for investors, says Jonathan Moreland, research director of InsiderInsights.com, who uses insider-trading data to zero in on investment ideas. 
Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling -- who resigned in August -- sold 160,000 shares for $9.8 million during the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares. 
Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment. 
Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they sold 5.8 million shares for about $449 million. During 1999, insiders sold 3.4 million shares for $123.1 million. 
Since December 1999, only one Enron executive has reported buying company shares. The buyer was Andrew Fastow, who was ousted during the week as Enron's chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the company and Mr. Fastow. 
Mr. Fastow reported purchasing 10,000 Enron shares in August at $36.98 each, or a total of $369,800. Today, those shares are valued at $163,500, based on Enron's stock price of $16.35 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading. After the purchase, Mr. Fastow owned 110,586 shares, Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics says. 
Enron said Mr. Fastow wasn't available to comment. 
On Monday, a New York law firm filed suit in U.S. District Court in Houston, alleging that Enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down the value of investments in limited partnerships managed by Mr. Fastow. The suit, which seeks class-action status, also says Enron insiders sold $73 million of their own Enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001.

Credit Markets
Enron's Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Credit-Rating Concerns
By Jathon Sapsford and Suzanne McGee
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s bonds have held up better than its battered stock amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse. 
Not for long, some bond traders say.
In trading yesterday, the Houston company's five-year bond, a $250 million issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 6.4%, was quoted at 82 cents on the dollar, down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday, and representing a 16% drop during the past two weeks. 
That is far less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 disclosure of a $1.01 billion charge linked to soured investments, resulting in a $618 million third-quarter loss. But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is a widening from about three percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit, that kind of ""spread"" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single B or lower. 
Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound, disclosing late yesterday that it drew down more than $1 billion on its bank credit lines to shore up its finances. Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline, investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds. Yesterday's 82 bid, for instance, was for a block of less than $2 million in bonds, a small percentage of a typical trade. 
Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating concerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of troubles, including losses, a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer. 
""Even at these levels, there's very little buying interest,"" said Harold Rivkin, a principal at distressed-debt trader H. Rivkin & Co. in Princeton, N.J. 
In one sign of the ripple effects, the price investors pay to protect themselves from losses on Enron debt was surging. The cost of a ""default swap"" -- in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at face value in the event of default -- rose to 10% of the size of the credit being insured. That was up from 8% a day earlier, and more than holders of Lucent Technologies Inc. debt had to pay at the height of that technology company's troubles earlier during the year. 
Even with its woes, Enron remains an investment-grade company. Most credit-rating agencies rate Enron's senior unsecured debt at several notches above the noninvestment-grade level. 
Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investors Service last week. (Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Cos., stopped short of putting the company on its Creditwatch list, opting instead to revise its long-term ratings outlook to ""negative,"" citing concerns about the company's financial flexibility.) 
Meanwhile, the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for the worst. ""These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward distressed levels,"" said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at Credit Sights Inc., an independent fixed-income research firm in New York. ""They aren't distressed yet, but they are headed in that direction."" 
If Enron's credit ratings fall, it would have implications far beyond the company's ability to raise money. For an energy trader, a credit downgrade sends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to make good on its commitments. 
Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities. Though it is best known for trading electricity and natural gas, the company also is a huge force in the markets for other commodities such as lumber, metals, bandwidth capacity and steel. As a market maker matching buyers and sellers, Enron handles about a quarter of all the trading in the nation's energy and gas markets. 
Enron's credit-worthiness is hugely important. The better its credit rating, the cheaper it can hedge, or offset, its positions in all these commodities markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers. Without that credit rating, the cost of this high-margin, high-volume business starts to rise. A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to, or derived from, that of an underlying security or asset, such as a stock, bond or commodity. 
""Even if the company does retain its investment-grade rating, the perception that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses,"" said Mr. Reynolds at Credit Sights Inc. ""Any prudent risk [manager] at Enron's counterparties"" -- any institution on the other end of a financial agreement with Enron -- ""is going to be examining their exposure to Enron, and looking for ways to minimize it or offset it,"" Mr. Reynolds said. 
To be sure, Enron, despite its recent woes, remains a strong company, credit analysts said. ""I don't think anyone's seriously thinking that this is a company that would ever default,"" Mr. Reynolds said. 
""So far, our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are sticking with them,"" said Ron Barone, managing director of Standard & Poor's utility energy project finance group. ""No one has cut credit lines or asked for additional collateral that we have identified. And customers have publicly stated that it's business as usual."" 
Yet analysts say the arrival of distressed-debt traders on the scene could make life more difficult for Enron and its management. Traders expect Enron's new Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon and Chairman Kenneth Lay to make the rounds of Wall Street next week, meeting with rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
Treasurys 
Treasurys rallied on optimism that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates more than previously expected after a spate of economic reports that documented how weak the economy was after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
Prices also gained as the market finished digesting the week's flood of Treasury, corporate and agency debt issues. 
At 4 p.m. EDT, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 13/32 point, or $4.0625 per $1,000 face value, at 103 20/32. Its yield fell to 4.537% from 4.588% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices. 
The 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 22/32 point at 101 11/32 to yield 5.284%, down from 5.330% Wednesday. 
Fed policy makers are slated to meet on Nov. 6. Also providing support for longer maturities, the Treasury Department made another repurchase of issues outstanding. It received offers for $5.04 billion in callable 30-year bonds, of which it accepted $1 billion. The offer-to-cover ratio, an indication of demand, was 5.04.

Corporate Bonds 
Motorola Inc.'s offering of three-year mandatory convertible securities, expected late yesterday was boosted from a planned $875 million and could total as much as $1.15 billion (proceeds) if investors exercise their overallotment option. 
The securities were expected to have a dividend of between 6.75% and 7% and a conversion premium of 20% to 22%. Earlier indications were a dividend of 7% to 7.5% and a conversion premium of 18% to 22%. The deal was to come through Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney. 
Separately, LSI Logic Corp. repriced an offering of $450 million of five-year convertible subordinated notes, lowering the price to 99 from par, people familiar with the Rule 144a private placement said. 
The notes have a 4% coupon and a 41% conversion premium and now offer a yield-to-maturity of 4.22%. They were quoted lower at 98 1/2 early yesterday, a sign that the deal wasn't well-received after being brought overnight by Lehman Brothers.

Heard on the Street
Most Analysts Remain Plugged In to Enron
By Susanne Craig and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal

Enron: Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so little about. 
In recent years, Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly -- critics would say blindly -- enthusiastic about Enron, even as they acknowledge not always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted for its soaring profits. Now, Enron is reporting steep losses from some of its most complicated transactions, which many on Wall Street still can't figure out.
In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer conceded that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it difficult to value the company. The company's ""lack of disclosure and transparency,"" he says, is ""a longstanding Enron hallmark."" 
So is this a stock to avoid, in his view? Hardly. Goldman on Wednesday did bump Enron off its ""U.S. Select List,"" which consists of a few dozen top stock picks -- but Mr. Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm's larger but prestigious ""Recommended List"" of 200 or so favored stocks, where it has been since he joined Goldman in 1993. 
""Just because I can't be specific in being able to create a simple model . . . doesn't mean that you write off that industry and say `I can't analyze it' or `I can't figure it out,' "" says Mr. Fleischer, who owns an undisclosed number of Enron shares. ""If that were the case, there would be an awful lot of industries we couldn't follow."" 
Enron's shares have dropped about 50% since last week. 
""Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a black box,"" says Jim Chanos, principal of Kynikos Associates in New York, who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiting from its fall -- throughout this year. ""It was really a trust-me story, when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that level of trust."" 
True, no stock picker is immune from bad calls. And Wall Street analysts long have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias, particularly on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had. 
But Enron stands apart, precisely because so many of the analysts still recommending the stock have acknowledged that the company's disclosure practices are lacking. Which raises the question: How can an analyst recommend that others purchase a stock when key information about the company's operations is so often either unavailable or indecipherable? 
Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business aren't new. Many of the issues now plaguing Enron's stock were first raised more than a year ago by bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts. Yet time and again, Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the lingering questions about the company's various partnership transactions. 
Besides those partnerships, Enron also has been dogged by concerns about the secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings. 
Through it all, most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darling, publicly dismissing questions about the firm's accounting practices and level of disclosure. As of yesterday, of the 17 analysts who following the stock, 10 had a ""strong buy"" or equivalent rating on the stock, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Five others rated the stock a ""buy,"" though not strongly. 
Only Prudential Securities, which downgraded the stock this week, has a ""sell"" rating on Enron. 
The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile examples of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance, despite what in retrospect seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warranted. 
Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Index's general collapse, analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- particularly those who, like Goldman's Mr. Fleischer, own shares in the companies they cover. Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromised themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees and other revenue. 
Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms. For instance, for one $865 million equity offering in 1999 led by `Credit Suisse First Boston, Enron retained seven co-managers, including Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. 
""Enron is a big company, and I don't think you're going to find a firm that hasn't been involved,"" says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer, who still rates the stock a ""strong buy"" with a $40 price target. ""They pay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street."" 
He adds, ""We do our analysis every day based on the information we have. Are we here strictly to defend companies? That's ludicrous. We're here to provide information to investors. . . . Yes, I have the wrong recommendation on the stock. I don't think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has performed."" 
Mr. Fleischer, whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron, calls his holding ""a meaningful investment"" that is ""not small."" But he disputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised. Mr. Fleischer says his clients ""are happy to know"" he has a stake in Enron, because it shows he puts his money where his mouth is. 
In his research note Wednesday, Mr. Fleischer called for complete disclosures of Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships. Despite the resulting difficulty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company, he wrote that he and many other investors historically ""have given Enron the benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings"" and position as an industry leader. 
""There's not information to really model this and be able to predict accurately where revenues are going to come from and where they're going to make their money, but every quarter they do,"" he says. ""It's hard to get inside to know all the transactions, but they do deliver."" 
CSFB's Mr. Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company, occasionally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the financial press. On Monday, he wrote that he expects questions about Enron's partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue, but that he remains ""confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [Enron] and an ultimate recovery in the share price."" 
""I know I'm wrong on the stock,"" Mr. Launer says. But he says that at these prices, he isn't ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue as much as $2 billion worth of shares, diluting current holders -- the stock doesn't have much further to fall. 
Clearly, Messrs. Launer and Flesicher aren't alone. ""Even in relative terms, analysts remain very bullish on this stock,"" says Chuck Hill, director of research at Thomson Financial/First Call. The average rating for a stock on Wall Street is 2.2, or slightly shy of a ""buy"" rating. Enron scores a 1.6. ""This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad news is out,"" Mr. Hill says. 
In downgrading the stock this week, Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped it to ""sell"" from ""buy,"" with a brief stop at ""hold."" While she is the only analyst to recommend investors sell the stock, she openly concedes her recent downgrades come ""too little, too late."" 
Ms. Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years. She says the company's disclosure practices fall far short of ideal, and senior executives are often evasive, even when presented with direct questions. For instance, she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They said ""no,"" she says. 
In light of the company's acknowledgment this week of an SEC ""inquiry,"" she asked Enron about the previous denial. ""They told me it is an inquiry, not an investigation,"" she says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned of the SEC's inquiry only last Wednesday.

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose stock has
fallen on concern about the largest energy trader's transactions
with affiliates, drew down $3 billion in credit to restore
confidence in its financial strength.

     The Houston-based company will use about $2.2 billion to pay
off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash,
spokesman Mark Palmer said.

     ``Nothing instils confidence like cash,'' he said.

     Enron's shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as
investors worry that the company's credit rating will be cut after
$1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments.
Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading
partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     Investors say they are worried about $3.3 billion in
liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell Enron assets.
Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the company $35 million.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

     Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35 yesterday.

Enron Liked By Analysts Despite Complicated Dealings, WSJ Says
2001-10-26 06:12 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is liked by many
Wall Street analysts despite lingering questions about the power
trading company's complicated partnership transactions and the
techniques used to record earnings, the Wall Street Journal
reported in its ``Heard on the Street'' column.

     Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst David Fleischer, who owns an
undisclosed number of Enron shares, said that even though
inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the
company, that doesn't mean he will write off the industry or not
analyze Enron.

     Of the 17 analysts who follow the stock, 10 had a ``strong
buy'' or equivalent rating, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call, the paper said. Five rated it ``buy'' and one had a ``sell''
on Enron.

     Most analysts have stuck by the company, publicly dismissing
questions about Enron's accounting practices and level of
disclosure, the Journal said.

     The Securities and Exchange Commission is inquiring about
partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.


Enron Draws Down $3 Billion From Its Credit Lines, WSJ Reports
2001-10-26 00:28 (New York)

     New York, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. drew down about
$3 billion of its available credit, the bulk of its bank credit
lines, to restore confidence in the financial strength of the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

     The energy trading company, whose shares have fallen 52
percent since Oct. 16, will use part of the money to redeem about
$1.85 billion short-term commercial debt, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.

     Enron is talking to banks about a new, multi-billion line of
credit, the paper reported, citing the unidentified person. The
steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it
has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is
disrupted, the paper said.

     Enron said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire that it
drew on its credit lines to provide more than $1 billion in cash
liquidity. The steps come a day after Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commission
probe of partnerships he ran.

Action by Enron halts stock's fall 
But credit ratings are being reviewed 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
The recent freefall of Enron Corp.'s stock price stabilized Thursday, a day after the world's largest energy trader replaced its chief financial officer. 
Enron, under a cloud for a number of reasons, including an Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry, also made two announcements Thursday night aimed at reassuring the financial community. 
In the announcements, Enron said it had drawn more than $1 billion from its lines of credit and said that energy-trading business done through EnronOnline on Thursday was above average levels. 
Houston-based Enron banked the money and has no plans to spend it, a spokeswoman said. 
""We are making it clear that Enron has the full support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments in the ordinary course of business,"" Jeff McMahon, who took over Wednesday as chief financial officer, said in a written statement. 
Enron said it recorded more than 8,300 transactions through EnronOnline on Thursday. 
Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive officer, said: ""Enron continues to be the market-maker of choice in wholesale and gas power markets, our customers continue to put their confidence in us, and our core businesses are strong and performing well."" 
Earlier Thursday, two credit rating agencies took actions regarding Enron's ratings, which J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Anatol Feygin described as ""just more negative sentiment."" 
At one point in Thursday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, shares in Enron were up more than $1.50, but they closed down 6 cents at $16.35. As recently as Oct. 16, the stock closed at $33.84. 
Before the market closed, international credit-rating agency Fitch put Enron, which currently holds investment-grade credit ratings, on review for a possible downgrade. Then after the market closed, Standard & Poor's took two steps: It affirmed Enron's current ratings, but it also revised its long-term ratings outlook to negative. 
Moody's Investors Service put all of Enron's long-term debt on review for potential downgrade last week. 
Enron, which noted that losing its investment-grade rating would take downgrades of three notches, said Thursday it will do everything in its power to defend its current rating. 
In the SEC inquiry, federal securities regulators are reviewing transactions between Enron and two private investment partnerships formerly run by Andrew Fastow, who was removed as Enron's chief financial officer Wednesday. Enron removed Fastow as part of its bid to repair its damaged credibility. 
Wall Street is also questioning certain of Enron's financing vehicles and is wondering whether the company will face hits to its balance sheet in the months ahead. 
S&P said it was concerned that the sizable drop in Enron's market capitalization has negatively affected its financial flexibility and could hurt the company's plans to rebuild its balance sheet. 
But it also noted that the ""fundamental strength"" of Enron's energy marketing and trading business has remained steady. 
Unless Enron's rebuilds confidence among investors and business partners, Fitch said, it could ""impair Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital markets,"" which would hurt its ability to conduct business. 
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, said the actions by S&P and Fitch might make some of Enron's energy customers skittish. 


Corporate US on track for bailout

Battered corporate America will receive an immediate Dollars 25bn (pounds 18bn) tax rebate under a Dollars 100bn eocnomic stimulation package just approved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. 
The controversial package, worth an estimated Dollars 212bn over three years, includes Dollars 70bn for companies next year alone. It was approved by the House late on Wednesday by 216 votes to 214, but faces significant amendment in the Senate, which is now under Democrat control.
It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans, who favour corporate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession, and Democrats - who, in a reprise of the Roosevelt ""new deal"", prefer to see increased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects. 
Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars 6.3bn to the 14 biggest corporations - which, they say, are renowned for paying little or no tax. 
The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, or AMT, introduced in 1986 to make sure firms could not avoid all tax payments. This, strongly supported by President Bush, would be made retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded. 
The lobby groups and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service calculate that this would give a Dollars 1.4bn boost to computer group IBM alone, while General Motors would get back Dollars 833m and General Electric Dollars 671m. 
Others to benefit include TXU, the Texas-based utility that is the US's third largest energy supplier, which would would be given Dollars 608m. United Airlines, the US's second largest carrier - which is warning of bankruptcy - would receive Dollars 371m, and Enron, the energy trading group forced to sack its finance director this week, would be given Dollars 254m. 
Democrat leaders in the Senate are determined to erase this measure and dislike other proposals to boost firms, which include a 30% tax break for capital investment over three years worth Dollars 39.3bn this year alone. They say these amount to a ""giant corporate giveaway"". 
Mr Bush and other Republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would help companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay-offs and invest more, prompting an economic recovery that, at best, is likely to start in the new year. 
""Businesses are America's employers. They're the hardware store, the diner down the street, the gas station on the corner. They're not the enemy of working families,"" the author of the plan, Representative Bill Thomas of California, said. 
Democrats are especially incensed with the alleged paucity of the package's provisions for the growing numbers of jobless, arguing that much of the Dollars 12bn foreseen would not go to individuals but into the reserves of states. 
* A fresh round of global trade talks is essential to revitalise the world economy after the terrorist attacks on the US, trade secretary Patricia Hewitt said yesterday, writes Charlotte Denny 
As a new report predicted that global trade growth will collapse this year, Ms Hewitt warned that the world must not retreat into protectionism or isolationism in the wake of the attacks. WTO trade ministers are gathering in Doha, Qatar, in two weeks' time to discuss launching a new round of talks, the first since the collapse of their meeting in Seattle, nearly two years ago.

Harvey Pitt's S.E.C.: From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy?
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

CAN the new, friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy? 
Harvey L. Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman, set out this week to show that he is not like his predecessor, Arthur Levitt. In a speech to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior leadership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr. Levitt's reform efforts -- Mr. Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at his predecessor. 
From now on, he promised, ''the commission will make sound decisions, in a respectful, affirmative way, not in a demeaning, demanding or demonizing way.'' He spoke favorably of ''pro forma'' earnings reports, in ways that no doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make even the worst profit figures look pretty. There was no mention of Mr. Levitt's concerns about improper management of earnings.
On the heels of Mr. Pitt's speech, the S.E.C. used a minor enforcement action to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward to report their own errors. The decision itself was reasonable, although one could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a fraud that went on for years. But the way the S.E.C. trumpeted it raised questions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather than a guard dog. ''Is this amnesty for financial fraud?'' Jane Adams, the accounting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former S.E.C. staff member, asked in a report to clients. She was not sure of the answer. 
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pitt dismissed such worries. ''No one is going to get away with anything,'' he said. ''What we are trying to do is create an environment where people feel comfortable'' and can talk to the S.E.C. ''without feeling we are looking for a big splash.'' 
A major embarrassment for accountants is having the S.E.C. force a client to restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief accountant, Robert Herdman, are sending signals that fewer such demands will be made. ''I am very much in favor of a vigorous enforcement program,'' Mr. Pitt said in the interview, ''but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting statements and restatements.'' 
Mr. Pitt talks of companies ''getting it right the first time,'' which would certainly be nice. But there is a risk that companies will become more aggressive in their accounting, figuring there will be no real penalty, like a restatement, if they are caught. That would make life harder for auditors who try to resist misleading accounting. 
In trying to sound comforting to the accountants' group -- an organization that, as he noted, he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr. Pitt has done little to reassure investors of his independence. 
The proof, of course, will come in the performance. Fortunately, the mess at Enron gives the S.E.C. a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image. It will take time for the commission to determine if the company's accounting was proper. But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explain -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made with partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer. 
''This could,'' a former S.E.C. staff member said, ''focus the issue on whether companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosures.'' And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite.

Enron draws down at least 1 bln usd from credit lines to boost mkt confidence

10/26/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

HOUSTON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it drew on committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of 1 bln usd as part of moves to restore market confidence in the company. 
""We are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments in the ordinary course of business,"" said newly appointed Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon.
""This is an important step in our plan to restore investor confidence in Enron. Additionally, we will update investors over the next several days regarding our plans to maintain our long-term credit rating."" 
According to the Wall Street Journal, Enron drew down about 3 bln usd and will use part of the money to offer to redeem about 1.85 bln usd of outstanding commercial paper, with the remainder providing the energy concern with a cash cushion. The newspaper cited a person familiar with the matter. 
It quoted observers as saying the move may be is a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted. 
The source also said Enron is talking to its banks about a new, multi-billion-dollar credit line.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>
Staff Reporter
10/26/2001 07:08 AM EDT
URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10003035.html>
TheStreet.com
1. United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest
Rule No. 1 in CEO school: Never say that your company may soon collapse. 
Seems kind of obvious, but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief James Goodwin, who warned in a letter to employees that the company ""will perish"" next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses, which have worsened since the terrorist attacks. ""Today, we are literally hemorrhaging money,"" he wrote. 
In raising concerns about the financial viability of United, a unit of UAL (UAL:NYSE - news - commentary) , Goodwin only put into words what outsiders have speculated about. Since Sept. 11, the airline has laid off about 20,000 of its 100,000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25%. It's expected to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings. 
But in response to the disclosure, Goodwin has been roundly attacked. Feeling that he had been all too honest, investors have knocked an additional 24% off the stock's value. The shares are down 54% since Sept 11. Meanwhile, UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulties to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations. The leaders of one union have petitioned the company's board of directors to have him sacked. 
Bottom line: CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth, but sometimes it doesn't pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios, either. Especially when that scenario is the company's own demise. 
2. Forget the Victory Gardens; Let's Have a Comfortable War 
Sure, we're at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our annihilation. But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy some DVD players? Maybe even a nice new car? 
That was basically the message from the Treasury Department, on news that Congress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism efforts and rebuilding following the attacks. Officials at Treasury applauded the sentiment, then politely suggested it would be even better for the economy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff. ""The economy is perhaps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the war on global terrorists,"" says Betsy Holahan, a department spokesperson. ""War bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism."" 
For the record, we don't think an issue of war bonds would be dumb, just superfluous. After all, nothing's stopped Americans from buying generic savings bonds -- or better yet, Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by the federal government. 
In the meantime, it's a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop. War bonds notwithstanding, we're a long way off from the era of ration books. 
3. Enron Again
Last week, we noted the extent of alarm about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $1.2 billion, following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions. Following that disclosure, besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the company on what's delicately termed a ""leave of absence."" 
In July, Fastow exited a limited partnership, from which he had reportedly reaped large profits, after shareholders and analysts objected to his involvement. Concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowledged Fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confidence. 
But that won't be an easy task, given the resentment about Enron's disinclination to explain its problems. One analyst called Fastow's departure ""unsettling,"" noting that management had given the CFO its endorsement only the day before. Sounding a note of exasperation, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase, Banc of America Securities and Prudential all downgraded the stock. And there could be more trouble to come: The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued Enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions. 
4. Gold Diggers 
It's understandable that investors felt panicky in September. Unfortunately, some reacted by shoving their hard-earned money into gold funds. According to Financial Research Corp., which tracks fund flows, the specialty precious-metals category was the best-selling equity category during September, with net inflows of $101 million. 
Granted, that's not a huge sum in the mutual fund world. By comparison, during the same month, large growth funds saw net redemptions of $7.4 billion. But the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is noteworthy, given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long. 
Sure, under the bizarre circumstances of late, they've enjoyed somewhat of a pop. According to Morningstar, the average precious-metals fund is up 10.08% year to date. But over the past five years, the same category lost an embarrassing 14.68%. By comparison, even large-cap growth funds -- everybody's favorite whipping boy -- managed to post a positive return. In the same period, they were up 7.13%. 
Moreover, circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades -- a combination of attacks on the U.S. government and war -- still don't seem to have boosted gold prices significantly. Despite an initial surge in prices after the terrorist attacks, they're again approaching their pre-Sept. 11 levels. It's too early to say, but it's likely the gold bugs will confront disappointment once again. 
5. Amazon Amazes Once Again
Amazon (AMZN:Nasdaq - news - commentary) still maintains it will become profitable by the fourth quarter. Well, at least it will post a pro forma operating profit. 
OK, so maybe that wouldn't include Amazon's service on $2.17 billion in long-term debt or extraordinary charges. In fact, a pro forma operating profit is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy, meaningless aura of minor triumph. The company still hasn't said when it will turn an economic profit. 
For that matter, even the fourth-quarter prediction is iffy. After announcing the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit, CFO Warren Jenson added the humble qualifier, ""There are no guarantees."" Amazon simultaneously lowered its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue, predicting that sales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10% compared with a year ago. 
Third-quarter trends weren't encouraging. Though sales overall were up slightly in the third quarter from a year ago, revenue from the company's core books and music business actually fell 12%. At least the company has made progress in cutting costs: A spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses have decreased by 20% over the past year. 
Incidentally, in the wake of Amazon's earnings report, two analysts made the belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock, which has fallen 93% from its high back in December 1999. Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget and SG Cowen analyst Scott Reamer downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from previous buy ratings. ""We thought there might be upside to our estimates,"" noted Blodget. ""There wasn't.""

Stocks Post Gains After A Rough Morning

NEW YORK, Oct. 25 -- Selected buying of technology and energy shares pulled the stock market higher today, reversing a morning slide triggered by a pair of grim economic reports. 
Shares of semiconductor makers and equipment manufacturers did particularly well, as did energy traders, led by a surprisingly strong performance from Williams Cos., a Tulsa-based energy firm that had an 83 percent jump in third-quarter net earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed rose at 9448.78, up 103.16, reversing an earlier deficit of 167 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.29, to 1767.83, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was rose 12.79, to 1097.99. 
Earlier, a pair of dismal economic reports had compounded worries about the fallout from last month's terrorist attacks to send stocks lower. As in recent sessions, however, investors absorbed the bad news and focused on good news regarding individual companies. 
Williams Cos. surpassed analysts' estimates for the third quarter and raised its forecasts for full-year earnings for 2001 and 2002. Investors rewarded the company by driving its shares up $1.42, to $27.32, bringing several other parts of the energy sector along with it. 
Even the shares of Enron rose, a day after the embattled company dismissed its chief financial officer and replaced him with an another executive from within the company. Enron rose 28 cents, to $16.69. 
Semiconductor shares also rebounded, led by industry bellwether Intel, up 44 cents at $25.92, and Applied Materials, up $1.35 at 36.69. Leading data-storage maker EMC rose $1.06, to $13.54. 
Traders said the Senate's passage this afternoon of an anti-terrorism measure also helped lift investor sentiment. Late Wednesday, the House passed a $100 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the terrorist attacks on the economy. 
A surprisingly large drop in orders for durable goods had weighed heavily on the market in the morning, as did poor earnings results from American International Group and WorldCom. 
The Commerce Department reported orders plunged in September for the fourth consecutive month. The 8.5 percent decline was far worse than the 1.3 percent dip many analysts had forecast. 
The Labor Department also reported that the number of newly laid-off Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose by 8,000 last week, to 504,000, the second-highest figure in nearly a decade and a level that is generally associated with recessions. 
Other Indicators 
* The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.88, to 562.96; the American Stock Exchange index rose 5.10, to 828.67; and the Russell index of 2,000 small stocks rose 8.31, to 435.96. 
* Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 9 to 7 on the NYSE, where trading volume rose to 1.38 billion shares, from 1.35 billion on Wednesday. On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 3 to 2 and volume totaled 2.2 billion, up from 1.84 billion. 
* The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose $4.38 per $1,000 invested, and its yield fell to 4.54 percent, from 4.59 percent late Wednesday. 
* The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and the euro. In late New York trading, a dollar bought 122.87 yen, up from 122.76 yen late Wednesday, and a euro bought 89.25 cents, down from 89.42 cents. 
* Light, sweet crude oil for December delivery settled at $22.01 a barrel, up 32 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
* Gold for current delivery rose to $277.80 a troy ounce, from $275.90 on Wednesday, on the New York Mercantile Exchange's Commodity Exchange.

Sudhakar will head Enron probe panel

MUMBAI: Retired supreme court judge Sudhakar Kurdukar will head the judicial panel set up by the Maharashtra government to investigate into the controversial Enron deal. 
An announcement in this regard was made by chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh at a press conference held at Mantralaya on Wednesday.
The ruling Democratic Front (DF) coalition had differences over the appointment of the judge, with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) demanding that a retired judge of the Bombay high court head the judicial panel. The Congress and the Left Front partners in the DF, however, insisted on a supreme court judge. 
The issue was hotly debated in the coordination committee of the DF. The NCP members in the DF finally left the decision to Mr Deshmukh.

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines in Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidity

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Embattled Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liquidity, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
Enron (ENE) will use part of the money to offer to redeem around $1.85 billion in outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder used to provide a cash cushion. This person also said that Enron was talking to its banks about a new multibillion-dollar credit line. Some observers thought the moves were a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access to bank lines be interrupted.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong. But ""when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank,"" said an Enron spokesman. In a prepared statement, the company's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, ""we are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."" 
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over the Houston energy-trading firm in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Thursday, for example, Enron was involved in about $4 billion worth of deals through its EnronOnline unit. 
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. It has reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it did with entities run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday. 
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency, Fitch, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade while Standard & Poors changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Service has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade. In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several notches. 
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. Together with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment grade rating would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue millions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of existing shares. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down six cents at $16.35.

Enron chief executive resigns from board of i2 Technologies

10/25/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

DALLAS (AP) - Kenneth Lay, the chairman and chief executive of embattled Enron Corp., has resigned from the board of software company i2 Technologies. 
""This is a very painful decision,"" Lay said in a statement issued Thursday by Dallas-based i2 Technologies. ""But now that I am again taking on the CEO responsibilities at Enron, I must reduce my outside activities.""
Lay resumed the chief executive's job at Enron in August after Jeff Skilling surprised investors by leaving the Houston-based energy company. 
Enron officials did not immediately return calls from The Associated Press. 
In the past week, Enron has been rocked by questions surrounding partnerships that did business with Enron while they were managed by the company's chief financial officer. The official was replaced on Tuesday. 
Enron's stock price has fallen nearly 50 percent since interest in the partnerships intensified, and the company acknowledged that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the arrangements 
I2 makes software to help companies manage their supply chains, and its clients include Texas Instruments, Ford Motor Co. and Dell Computer Corp. 
I2 stock plunged nearly 25 percent on Oct. 17 after the company reported a $5.53 billion third-quarter loss and said it would cut 1,000 jobs, about one-fifth of the work force. 
Lay joined the board in October 2000. No replacement was announced. 
In trading Thursday, i2 shares rose 24 cents to $4.95, and Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35.

As Enron's woes unnerve investors about energy sector, analysts say its problems are isolated
By BRAD FOSS
AP Business Writer

10/25/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK (AP) - As it grew over the past decade into the country's largest natural gas and power marketing company, Enron Corp. became the de facto barometer of health within the energy trading sector. 
Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enron's competitors based in part on the huge success of the Houston-based company's business model. Now, executives and industry analysts hope to prevent Enron's internal tumult and free-falling stock price from undermining investors' confidence in the sector. They say the Houston-based company's problems should be viewed in isolation and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace.
""The marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was yesterday, a week ago or a month ago,"" said Jim Donnell, president of Duke Energy North America, a division of Duke Energy Corp. that generates and trades power. 
That opinion appeared to gain acceptance on Thursday as shares of Dynegy Inc., El Paso Corp. and Duke Energy Corp. rebounded from losses on Wednesday, when Enron's latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of its rivals. 
Enron's stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week (and nearly 80 percent since January) and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytime soon. 
The latest troubles began Oct. 16 when Enron reported third quarter earnings, and a longtime concern among Wall Street analysts that executives were not entirely forthcoming only got worse. 
First came reports that some of the company's losses stemmed from partnerships managed by Enron's chief financial officer at the time, Andrew Fastow. That raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Then on Wednesday, one day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay defended Fastow, the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence. 
""They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test and they didn't come through with flying colors,"" said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York. 
Enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old, which have little to do with the company's wholesale energy business, which accounts for roughly 80 percent of profits. 
Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the face of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices. 
""Even though (Enron) shot themselves in the foot, the basic business is still sound and not likely to disappear,"" Ellinghaus said. 
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone echoed that sentiment. 
""The collateral damage to the rest of the space - Dynegy and El Paso - is overdone,"" Barone said. 
On Thursday, Williams Companies Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., reported net income of $760 million and Reliant Resources Inc. of Houston reported $133 million in profits. 
""It's business as usual,"" said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel. 
Not for Enron, whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high-speed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype. The downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of then-chief executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign. 
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of $638 million in the third quarter, taking a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to investment losses, troubled assets and unit restructurings. Excluding the charge, Enron earned $393 million on $47.6 billion in revenues for the three months ending Sept. 30. 
Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enron's competitors were brought down Wednesday because of ""dire"" speculation that Enron's troubles might be so bad that it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of receivables to companies such as Duke and Dynegy. 
""All I'm hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality,"" Ellinghaus said. 
Enron did not return calls seeking comment Thursday. 
Donnell of Duke Energy said the Charlotte, N.C.-based company is paying close attention to the Enron situation and that there has been no indication of receivables not being paid. 
""They continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to credit,"" he said. ""They've never missed a deadline.""

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)
2001-10-25 18:59 (New York)

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s long-term
credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by
Standard & Poor's after the largest energy trader's shares fell
49 percent in the past week.

     S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's ratings of
``BBB+/A2,'' which are investment grade.

     The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the
possibility that Enron won't generate enough money from selling
assets outside the main trading business to repay debt. S&P did
say that ``the strategic direction of the company is likely to
become more credit-positive in the wake of recent management
changes.''

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses from investments
outside the principal business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew
Fastow resigned yesterday as the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission asks for information about related-party transactions
he conducted.

     ``The S&P write up was very positive,'' said Dorothea
Matthews, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., a research firm. ``It

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)

     (Adds new Enron CFO in 14th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Concerns Enron Corp. will run
short on cash haven't prevented commodities traders from doing
business with the largest energy broker, customers say.

     The company handles about 25 percent of U.S. power and
natural-gas trading, said John Kilduff, vice president of energy
risk management for Fimat USA. It's also a leader in complex
derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of
fluctuating commodities prices.

     Enron's credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at
Moody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's
long-term credit outlook to negative after $1.01 billion in third-
quarter losses from some soured investments. The company needs
good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from
demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     So far, there are no signs that Houston-based Enron is
handling less business, Kilduff said.

     ``If they were unable to perform, it would be a major
problem,'' he said. ``It could get like Long-Term Capital if
things really broke down because the numbers are that big.''

     Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment fund for
the wealthy, incurred massive losses making bond trades during the
1998 Russian currency crisis. The fund's portfolio plunged. More
than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $3.6 billion
to avoid a collapse.

                         Needs Cash Daily

     Enron trades electricity, natural gas, coal and other
commodities worldwide, as well as complex financial instruments to
hedge against price swings in the goods.

     ``As of now, Enron is active in the markets,'' Kilduff said.
``No one is cutting trading lines that I can see, or demanding
different terms than before.''

     Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every
day to settle positions, said Kilduff, whose company swaps natural
gas and other energy investments with Enron.

     Some days, Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall,
while Enron bets that they will rise. Natural gas usually does one
or the other every day, and someone pays the difference.

     ``The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor,''
Kilduff said. ``Someone is paying someone else every day.''

     Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough
money to operate normally, and can fall back on $3.4 billion in
bank credit lines if necessary. The company is determined to
protect the credit rating, Enron has said.

     ``We aren't even going to entertain worst-case scenarios at
this point,'' said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.

                        Investor Questions

     Enron, based in Houston, ousted Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow yesterday, two days after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he
ran that invested in company shares. Those trades cost Enron $35
million. Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets unit,
replaced Fastow, who went on leave of absence.

     Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week. They
fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's all rate
the company's debt at investment grade.

     The company also faces questions from investors about $3.3
billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed
to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants.

     The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to
meet them by selling assets. Enron doesn't know if the sale
proceeds will cover the debt. The company would have to make good
on any shortfall.

                            Little Time

     Enron asked Citicorp Inc. on Tuesday to arrange a $750
million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut
out of the money markets.

     Enron had about $1.85 billion of commercial paper, or short-
term unsecured debt, outstanding as of Tuesday, traders said. The
company, which has a $3 billion program, has had difficulty
finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC
investigation was announced, the traders said.

     Today, Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percent
yield, 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies.

     ``There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough
time to get their house in order,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright,
senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates.
``There's a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self-
fulfilling prophecy, so they have less time than they think to
pacify the market.''

                           Ripple Effect

     Some investors are concerned that Enron's complex book of
hedges, swaps, options and other derivative contracts involves so
many partners, participants and companies that a failure would
pose a risk to the economy, and force a bailout like Long-Term
Capital Management's.

     ``The talk in the financial markets is that some counter
party to Enron could fail if Enron can't perform,'' said Jeff
Caughron, manager of $400 million in investments for Tinker
Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City. ``If it goes down, there
could be a big ripple effect.''

     The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron won't
be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine
Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and NRG Inc., said Chris
Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. As a group,
shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week.

     ``Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are
fueling a sell-off,'' he said. ``Both traders and companies
selling power to Enron are suffering.''

     All four companies said they're trading with Enron as they
have in the past.

                         Market Maker

     Enron supplies services some customers consider
irreplaceable. The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges
weather risk through Enron, said risk manager Jim Tracy.

     The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay
Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate
at peak efficiency and capacity; in dry seasons, when the dams
can't operate as well, Enron pays the district.

     ``If Enron's credit went bad, or they folded up, that
agreement wouldn't get picked up by someone else,'' Tracy said.

     Enron also helps many U.S. utilities protect themselves from
electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it
helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little
rainfall. Any impairment on Enron's part to continue doing so
would trickle down to Main Street utilities, Tracy said.

     ``Utilities would start reserving more on their balance
sheets for price swings,'' Tracy said.

Enron Broadband Begins Closing London, Singapore Offices
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications unit will close down its trading offices in London and Singapore over the next six months. 
Enron Broadband Services executives have quietly begun to inform employees overseas and haven't made a public announcement of plans to consolidate Asian and European bandwidth trading operations at the company's Houston headquarters.
""It's a way to structure the business to fit the opportunities that are out there in the market now,"" Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Terrie James said in response to questions from Dow Jones Newswires. 
The London office has 20 or fewer employees, James told Dow Jones. The Singapore office has 15 or fewer employees. 
Americans working in the offices would probably choose to relocate in the U.S., James said. She didn't know how many of the employees are U.S. citizens. She didn't know what options might be offered to the non-American employees. 
James didn't know how much money Enron might save by closing the offices. 
The decision by Enron, the leading bandwidth market-maker, shows that international bandwidth markets are having tough times like the U.S. market. 
Earlier this year, as the U.S. market went sour, Enron executives had said that European and Asian telecommunications carriers might be more open to bandwidth trading, making the markets in those regions ripe for growth.

Calpine:No Exposure To Enron; No Calif Pwr Contract Talks

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Calpine Corp. (CPN) has no credit exposure to trading partner Enron Corp. (ENE), Calpine said Thursday in an earnings conference call. And the company hasn't been contacted by the state of California about renegotiating the billions of dollars in long-term supply contracts the company signed with the state earlier this year. 
Calpine's diluted net earnings for the third quarter were 88 cents a share compared with 48 cents for the same quarter last year. Setting Calpine's consistent earnings growth aside, Wall Street analysts in Thursday's conference call focused their questions on trouble spots in the energy industry, like Enron, California, and whether the U.S. will have a surplus of electric power stations in a few years.
Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week. Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure to Enron. 
""We continue to assess the situation, but right now don't have any net exposure to Enron,"" said Calpine's vice president of corporate risk management, Paul Pasoli. ""We continue to trade with them. We will adjust our credit threshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating."" 
When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be halted immediately, Pasoli said that, in fact, Calpine would owe Enron a little money. 
In another energy industry area of concern, Calpine was asked about the state of California's stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars of long-term power contracts. Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under those contracts, which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now than when California bought this past winter and spring. 
""Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif contracts. In general, we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties to do so as well,"" said Calpine cheif executive, Peter Cartwright. ""If there are any contract renegotiations that can result in a win-win, we would be happy to look at that, if California asks. We've done that many times."" 
As for future power prices, Calpine said that it's going forward with its program to build a portfolio of 70,000 megawatts of generation, which is about three times its current capacity and would be about 7% of all U.S. capacity. The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the difference between natural gas prices and power prices, and Calpine said that difference, or ""spark spread,"" has grown the past few months. Furthermore, the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all projects generate an after-tax return of 18% on the investment. 
As a result, the company expects earnings to grow at least 40% annually through 2005. Calpine will fund near-term cash needs in the debt markets and won't issue new stock until its stock price rises substantially.

Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. Files Class Action Suit Against Enron Corporation

10/25/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, against defendants Enron Corporation (""Enron"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: ENE), Kenneth L. Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). 
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of the Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors.
If you purchased Enron securities during the Class Period, you may, no later than December 21, 2001, move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff in this class action. A Lead Plaintiff is a representative, chosen by the Court, that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 directs Courts to assume that the class member(s) with the ""largest financial interest"" in the outcome of the case will best serve the class in this capacity. Courts have discretion in determining which class member(s) have the ""largest financial interest,"" and have appointed Lead Plaintiffs with substantial losses in both absolute terms and as a percentage of their net worth. If you have sustained substantial losses in Enron securities during the Class Period, please contact Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. at classaction@srk-law.com for a more thorough explanation of the Lead Plaintiff selection process. If you have relatively small losses, your ability to participate in any recovery will be protected by the Lead Plaintiff(s), and you need take no affirmative steps at this time. 
If you wish to discuss this action or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact plaintiff's counsel Robert M. Roseman toll-free at 888-844-5862 or via E-mail at classaction@srk-law.com. For more detailed information about the firm please visit its website at http://www.spectorandroseman.com.

TGS Q3 net profit up 22 pct yr-on-yr on higher NGL sales, transport revenues

10/25/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

BUENOS AIRES (AFX) - Perez Companc SA and Enron Corp pipeline joint venture, Transportadora de Gas del Sur SA, said its net profit in the three months to September rose 22 pct year-on-year to 37 mln pesos on the back of strong growth in sales of natural gas liquids (NGL) and increased revenue from transport. 
Total revenue grew 24 pct year-on-year to 147 mln pesos, as ""TGS continues to grow its revenues in all of its business segments,"" CEO Eduardo Ojea Quintana said.
NGL sales surged 86 pct year-on-year to 31.1 mln pesos, after a partial takeover of the Cerri complex's production at Bahia Blanca, although volumes declined as a result of the start-up of the Mega project at the beginning of 2001, Ojea Quintana said. 
Gas transport revenue rose 11 pct year-on-year to 109.6 mln pesos as average gas transportation contracted capacity rose 6 pct to 62.5 mln cubic metres daily, following a capacity expansion completed in June. 
However, he also noted ""important challenges, mostly associated with the relevant regulatory issues that remain unresolved, as well as the deep economic crisis that Argentina is currently undergoing."" 
""These negative factors have adversely affected our investment plans for the current year and for 2002,"" Ojea Quintana added.

Enron Draws Down Credit Facility

10/25/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) drew on committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity of more than $1 billion. 
In a press release Thursday, the energy company said it has ""more than adequate"" liquidity to fulfill business commitments.
Enron said the credit action is a step to restore investor confidence, and it plans to update investors in several days regarding plans to maintain its long-term credit rating. 
Earlier Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its long-term ratings outlook for Enron to negative due to concerns that the company's significant drop in market capitalization has hurt the company's flexibility and could impair plans to rebuild the balance sheet. 
Over the past week, Enron's shares have fallen more than 40% amid negative news from the company. 
The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares closed Thursday at $16.35, down 6 cents, or 0.4%, on composite volume of 39,212,300 shares. Average daily volume is 7,832,606 shares. 
Early last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. Enron also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
On Wednesday, Enron replaced Fastow with Jeff McMahon, effective immediately. 

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that some bond traders believe Enron's bonds won't continue to hold up better the company's stock. 
The company's five-year bond has decreased about 16% in the past two weeks, much less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 disclosure of the $1.01 billion charges. 
But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is widening from about 3 percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron is still an investment-grade credit, that kind of ""spread"" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of single B or lower, the Journal said. 
On Wednesday, Fitch put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investor Service earlier this week. 
Several energy trading companies said Thursday that although they have concerns about Enron's credit quality, they have made almost no changes in policy concerning the company. 
Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Aquila Inc. (ILA) said they haven't changed their credit policy concerning Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in U.S. power and gas markets. 
The Journal reported that bond traders expect Enron executives to meet with rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks next week.

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)
2001-10-25 18:41 (New York)

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)

     (Company corrects structure of standard compensation package
in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself on
sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting
record profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom,
employees are sharing the pain.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to the
bulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensation
package, most employees get stock options equal to
5 percent of their annual base salary, spokeswoman Meredith
Philipp said.

     Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the end
of 2000, all at average prices above the company's current share
price. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.

     ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said.

     Enron's board sets the strike price for the options in
December or January. Employees can't cash the options in and make
a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. At
the end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December,
the board set a strike price of about $80.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.
They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.

     Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission
was asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, who
was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. One
partnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62
million shares from a partnership at a cost of $1.2 billion.

     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets
group, as CFO late yesterday.

                         Unvested Options

     Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employees
hadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million of
them, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 a
share. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.

     Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in
other industries, such as technology and telecommunications, say
it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall
below their options.

     ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuantic
Buck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensation
consulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, and
it's a continued disincentive to them.''

     While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice its
employees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock option
grant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role as
the company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15
years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February.
Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.

     The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent of
employees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but was
exercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above
$36.88 since Aug. 29.

Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)

     (Adds comment from CFO Fastow in fourth paragraph, Enron's
short-term borrowing rates in seventh paragraph.)

     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest
energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 million
loan, ensuring access to credit if the embattled company is cut
off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter.

     Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company
said the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its
finances. The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75
percent this year amid concerns about failed investments, depends
on a $3 billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to
finance day-to-day operations.

     Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service placed all $13
billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for
possible downgrade. As a second-tier commercial paper borrower,
any drop in its rating may cut off Enron from the commercial paper
market and raise the costs of short-term debt.

     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to both
the capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.
He said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,
giving it enough cash to operate normally.

     Enron shares rose as much as 12.6 percent during the call to
$23.25. They pared the gain to $21.80, up $1.15.

     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,
declined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, declined
to comment.

                      Commercial Paper Rates

     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until
Oct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies
with the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not on
credit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for a
possible downgrade.

     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and
advice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the
company on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-
fired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, along
with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion
loan.

     Earlier this week, an investor sued Enron, saying two
partnerships cost the company $35 million and Fastow's leadership
of them was a conflict of interest.

     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated
companies headed by Fastow. Dismantling some of the partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors.

     Enron created partnerships and affiliated companies to buy
and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its
books.

     Investors said they were concerned that Enron may be forced
to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in
cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he may have
to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies if Enron's
debt ratings fall too far.

Enron CFO: Company Has Sufficient Liquidity
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the company had procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest in dealings between Enron and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the Houston energy trading company to provide additional information about the partnerships, which Enron said were off-balance sheet financing vehicles used to hedge against fluctuations in the market.
In a conference call held Monday to discuss investor concerns about the SEC investigation and related matters, Lay said there was a ""Chinese wall"" in place to protect the interest of Enron shareholders. 
The procedures were ""rigorously followed,"" Lay said. 
In previous filings with the SEC, Enron said the terms of the transactions with the partnerships were ""reasonable compared to those which could have been negotiated with unrelated third parties."" 
Fastow resigned from the partnerships, which were known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investments LP in late July. 
The company also is involved in other off-balance sheet financing vehicles, including Marlin Water Trust II and Whitewing. 
During the conference call, investors said they were frustrated by the complex nature of the trusts, and asked for more information. 
Lay said the company would be providing a list of ""Frequently Asked Questions"" on its Web site later Tuesday that may provide more details. 
After Enron disclosed the SEC investigation Monday, the company's stock sunk to its lowest level in 52 weeks, $19.67. Enron shares were recently trading up 47 cents, or 2.3%, at $21.12, in brisk volume that has already surpassed its average daily turnover of 6.3 million shares. 
Lay said he was ""extremely disappointed"" in the current stock price. 
""Our businesses are performing very well and we are continuing to conduct business,"" he said. 

During the conference call, Enron officials declined to specify Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fastow to create and run the partnerships. 
Enron officials also addressed concerns that investors had about the potential need to issue additional Enron stock. 
Under certain circumstances, for example, if both Enron's stock and credit rating fall to certain levels, the company would need to issue additional shares to the partnerships, diluting the holdings of current shareholders. 
Enron officials declined to say how much dilution would occur under a ""worst-case scenario."" 
However, the officials said they doubted there would be a need to issue the additional stock because the company plans to work with the credit-rating agencies to prevent such an event. 
Moody's put Enron on watch for a downgrade of its long-term debt last week after the company announced a $1 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 million loss. 
According to Lay, Enron's debt rating would need to fall several notches to below investment grade in order to trigger the need to issue more stock. 
""We are committed to maintaining our ratings,"" Lay said. ""Moody's said they would work with us,"" he added. 
Furthermore, Fastow said, Enron expects to have ""sufficient liquidity"" to meet all its capital requirements. 

Enron's efforts to unwind the LJM partnerships contributed to a reduction of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity. However, Enron's Lay said the lower number of shares outstanding wouldn't affect the company's earnings outlook. 
Enron has said it expects to earn $1.80 a share in 2001 and $2.15 a share in 2002. The numbers are in line with the consensus estimates reported by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
""Despite the economy going softer, we think we can meet that,"" Lay said.

Enron says shareholders' 'best interests' were sought in all LJM dealings

10/23/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp said it sought the ""best interests"" of its shareholders in all its dealings with LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, two partnerships which were set-up and run until recently by Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
""The board (of Enron) was fully aware and kept a real Chinese wall between Enron and LJM. Enron's shareholders best interests were sought in all LJM dealings,"" said Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay, in a conference call with analysts.
The company scheduled the call after Enron's stock slid 21 pct yesterday, when it revealed the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions. 
Overnight, two class action lawsuits were launched by shareholders against Enron and its officers, alleging that operating results were also ""materially overstated"" as a result of the company failing to timely write-down the value. 
In its third-quarter results last week, Enron announced a charge of 1.01 bln usd, of 1.11 usd per share, and an incremental 1.2 bln usd reduction in stockholders' equity, related to the unwinding of investments with the LJM partnerships. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, Fastow resigned from the partnerships in July, due to growing suspicion over potential conflicts of interests. 
During the call, Lay said that he, and Enron's board of directors, have ""the highest faith and confidence in (Fastow)."" 
Lay also said the company remained confident that its current liquidity position allows it to meet all its obligations, and is confident of the outlook for its corporate rating. 
Analysts have raised the possibility that, should Enron's credit rating and stock price continue to fall, the company may be obligated to issue millions of new shares to meet obligations with other entities it deals with.

US class action suit filed against Enron for misleading statements

10/23/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP law firm said it filed a class action lawsuit yesterday against Enron Corp alleging that it issued misleading statements between Jan 18, 2000 and Oct 17, 2001, thereby inflating the company's share price artificially. 
The suit was filed on behalf of Enron shareholders between the above period and is pending in the US District Court in Houston against Enron Corp, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned recently, and Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
The suit claims that Enron issued statements which failed to disclose that the company was experiencing a declining demand for bandwidth and that its efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth failed because many market participants were not creditworthy.
The company's operating results were also ""materially overstated as result of the company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships"" managed by the company's CFO. The suit additionally alleges that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. 
On Oct 16, Enron announced unexpectedly that it was taking third quarter non-recurring charges of 1.01 bln after-tax, or 1.11 usd per share, which it later revealed was due largely to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by Enron's chief financial officer. Enron also announced it was cutting shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd. 
Enron's share price consequently fell sharply. During the class period, Enron insiders disposed of 73 mln usd of personally-held Enron common stock. 
Holders of Enron stock between the class period in question may request appointment as a lead plaintiff no later than Dec 21, Milberg Weiss said. 
Yesterday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that it provide information regarding certain related party transactions.

Word of SEC probe puts Enron into deep dive: Problems mount

NEW YORK - Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20% yesterday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transactions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August. 
A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating.
The SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry. 
Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
The company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years, and took US$1.01-billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. 
Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after six months at the helm. 
Enron shares declined US$5.49, or 21%, to US$20.56 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, shaving off almost US$4.2-billion of its market capitalization. 
The stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8% yesterday, when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998. 
Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC's inquiry into ""certain related-party transactions"" involved the partnerships. 
""Related-party transactions"" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Mr. Fastow severed his ties with the partnerships in June. LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy- and communication-related investments. 
The Journal reported US$35-million of its third-quarter loss of US$638-million were connected with the limited partnerships 
Curt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should question Enron's use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets, ""most notably in telecommunications,"" have declined precipitously. 
""Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron's credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined,"" Launer said. 
Some analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke. 
""This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. 
""It's easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challenges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one."" 
The price of shares in the company is down 75% this year.

City - SEC inquiry sparks Enron share fall.
By Simon English.

The Daily Telegraph

(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001

in New York 
ENRON, the American power giant, saw its shares slump by a fifth yesterday after it revealed that the top financial watchdog is delving into firms managed by chief financial officer Andrew Fastow.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is requesting details of deals between the company and limited partnerships with which Mr Fastow has, or had, links. 
Enron chairman Kenneth Lay said in a statement: ""We welcome this request. We will co-operate fully and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest."" 
Questions were raised last week on Wall Street after the company announced a write-down of more than $1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses. 
The disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23pc. Yesterday they fell another $5.30 ( #3.80) to $20.75 in early trading. 
According to the annual report the ""related party transactions"", as Enron describes them, took place in 1999 and 2000, resulting in losses of $16m and $36m respectively. 
Mr Lay said that auditors approved the deals, but would not give further details of what they were. 
They are understood to have been hedging transactions against Enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment JP. 
""We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done,"" added Mr Lay. 
The relationship between the investment losses and the SEC probe is not clear, though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions. 
Enron owns Teesside Power Station and Wessex Water in Britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the US. Investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company's credit rating. 
An Enron spokesman said Mr Fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion. 
The SEC inquiry is ""informal"", says the company. The watchdog contacted Enron last Wednesday, the day of the results announcement. The SEC declined to comment. 
Enron made a loss of $638m in the third quarter, its first in over four years.

Shares of Enron Plummet 21% Energy: SEC requests information from company on series of unusual financial deals tied to executive.
NANCY RIVERA BROOKS
TIMES STAFF WRITER

Los Angeles Times

Shares of Enron Corp. set a 52-week low Monday on word that the Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the Houston-based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive. 
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said it had voluntarily provided information on ""certain related-party transactions"" that had been previously disclosed to the SEC.
""We welcome this request,"" said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive. 
""We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest,"" he said. 
The SEC request is the latest in a parade of bad news for Enron, which has seen investments sour in telecommunications, retail electricity sales and water. 
Investors have battered the company's stock, which once sold for nearly $85 a share in the last year, and many have criticized Enron's stingy meting out of financial information. But several Wall Street analysts remain upbeat on the stock, noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn. 
In August, Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, one of the main architects of the company's strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit, stunned Wall Street by resigning. 
Skilling cited personal, family-related reasons, but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company's stock price contributed to his departure. 
On Monday, Enron shares plunged $5.40, or nearly 21%, to close at $20.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Enron's stock has lost nearly 40% of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third-quarter loss of $618 million after $1.01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments. 
But the charge also included $35 million related to what Enron described only as the ""early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity."" 
In a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings, the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions. 
But investors were stunned when stories last week in the Wall Street Journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, and that Enron had whittled $1.2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $1.2-billion note it had received from the partnership. Shareholder equity now stands at $9.5 billion. 
The limited partnership, called LJM2, and Fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved Enron assets and stock, the Journal reported. 
Lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed. 
A shareholder lawsuit charging that Enron's directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in Texas state court. 
Many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes, but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them, analyst say. 
Investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that Enron has guarded financial information, making it difficult to analyze the company's complex web of businesses. 
And many are not confident that all the bad news has been released. 
Analyst M. Carol Coale, who follows Enron and other energy companies for Prudential Securities in Houston, downgraded Enron to a ""hold"" from a ""buy"" rating Monday out of such frustration. 
Coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of Enron. 
But Bob Christensen, energy analyst with First Albany Corp., said that despite Enron's recent difficulties, the bulk of the business remains strong. 
""I continue to tell investors that 70% of this company's business is growing at a 26% rate, and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on,"" he said. 
Investors are panicking because of a ""bad news story that doesn't reflect reality,"" said Jon Kyle Cartwright, senior energy analyst with the Raymond James & Associates brokerage firm in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
""They are the world's largest energy trader, and they are very good at that,"" Cartwright said. 
""The reality is that everything is fine here,"" although more charges, perhaps $500 million worth, are expected in the next few quarters, related to businesses that Enron is selling.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income.

Subject:	ERCOT load comparison

Please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from May 2000 and May 2001.  There are two tabs, one tab contains the days May 16-18, 2000 and the other tab contains the days May 14-18, 2001.  Each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question.  The days most directly comparable are May 17, 2001 (Thursday) and May 18, 2000 (Thursday), although the two days preceding May 18, 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding May 17, 2001.  The peak on 5/17/2001, 44,923 MW, is 2.78% higher than the peak on 5/18/2000, 43,709 MW.  With similarly warm days before 5/17/2001 as there were before 5/18/2000, the peak would obviously have been even higher.  This would put the year-over-year growth in excess of 3%.  I believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year-over-year from an earlier analysis, somewhere in the range of 3.5% to 4%.  

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

"Logistics Commercial Realignment","
After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

All-
Mom and Dad have fired Joycelyn.  I don't need to go into the details, her
personality is unbearable!  I have asked Homeinstead to provide another
caregiver from the hours of 2-6pm, M, W, F.  With Cena providing
transportation for all doctor appointments and Mom's standing hair
appointments on Fridays.  I have stressed to Homeinstead that they need to
take the time to find the right person for Mom and Dad because the hours
could expand if they would find the right person.
Love, Margaret

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created. Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron shares, diluting the position of current shareholders. 
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months.
Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. 
He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. 
""There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds"" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. ""But if we are wrong, we will issue equity."" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. 
Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share. 
During the past week, shares of the energy-trading giant have dropped more than 40%. Early last week, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. The company also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. On Monday, Enron disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions related to Mr. Fastow. Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper. 
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors. Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said while ""we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our businesses are performing very well."" Mr. Lay and other executives said Enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs. 
Mr. Fastow, the chief financial officer, took part in the conference call. But neither he nor Mr. Lay would answer any questions concerning the Fastow-related partnership, which was known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Mr. Lay said the SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement, which has raised conflict-of-interest questions among analysts and others. Mr. Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions. Mr. Lay said he was ""very concerned about the way Andy's character has been loosely tossed about."" He added ""we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy."" 
Internal LJM2 documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership. Billions of dollars of Enron assets and stock were involved in LJM2-related transactions, according to Enron SEC filings. 
During the conference call, analysts -- even some who have been longtime Enron fans -- challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement and the company's often opaque financial reports. ""There's the appearance you are hiding something,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer. ""You need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board."" 
Mr. Lay responded, ""We're trying to be as transparent as we can.""

Enron Tries To Dismiss Finance Doubts

c. 2001 New York Times Company

Enron has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs stemming from unusual financing activities. 
In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into.
But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer any questions about it. 
The conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000. 
Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. 
One of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. ''There is an appearance that you are hiding something,'' he said. 
After the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. ''They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand,'' he said in an interview. ''They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them'' as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. ''I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans,'' he said. ''In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here.'' 
Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.'' 
Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm. 
Mr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares. 
Mr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. ''I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,'' Mr. Lay said. ''But let's move on to the next question.'' 
Mr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. 
Mr. Lay said he was sorry about ''the misunderstanding'' that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises. 
The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct. 
After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company ''will look into providing'' such statements.

Options Report
Surge in Optimism Prompts Straddles In Enron and Cisco
By Kopin Tan
Dow Jones Newswires

C14
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Bullish calls traded heavily early as investors, encouraged by the ability of stocks to shrug off anthrax scares, bought calls to replace stock holdings and to ride any rallies. 
At one point, the ratio of equity calls traded to puts at the Chicago Board Options Exchange fell to 0.28, compared with 0.68 Friday and Monday's three-month closing low of 0.42.
The surge of optimism -- also evident in the CBOE market-volatility index, or VIX -- prompted traders to begin covering the downside, just as the widely watched stock indexes began to retreat. Contrarians believe the CBOE equity put/call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 0.40. By the session's end, the ratio was at 0.49. 
Buyers drove robust call trading in Cisco Systems, a maker of Internet switching equipment, and the implied volatility also rose, noted a trader at Letco, the CBOE specialist for Cisco options. One investor bought thousands of January 20 calls, paying about $115 a contract for the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at $20 a share until mid-January. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Cisco was down 42 cents at $16.41. The January 20 calls fell 10 cents to 90 cents on CBOE volume of 27,048 contracts, while 6,861 contracts traded at the Pacific Exchange. 
The implied volatility of Enron's near-month options remains high, even as the energy concern's executives sought to calm investors and address their concerns, following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the Houston company. 
The volatility spike makes Enron a viable candidate for investors looking to sell straddles -- selling calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration. In particular, Enron's at-the-money January 20 straddles offer rich premiums, said Lillian Seidman of the Seidman/Skupp options team at Miller Tabak & Co., of New York. With Enron down 86 cents at $19.79 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, selling January 20 straddles would earn an investor about $750 a straddle -- a rich premium that could offset the cost of buying stock. 
To be sure, selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the stock, which already had fallen about 38% in a week, makes a big move in either direction before the straddles expire. Investors typically buy straddles if they expect a big move in the underlying stock, while sellers pocket premium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range.

Lay tries to assure Enron investors 
Company's credibility questioned 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron had safeguards in place to protect shareholder interests while its chief financial officer ran two investment partnerships that did business with Enron, the company's chief executive officer said Tuesday. 
The Houston-based energy trader has been caught in a storm of criticism over Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's former role with two partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, that entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements with Enron. 
Enron disclosed Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an ""informal inquiry"" into transactions between Enron and the two partnerships. 
It declined to say if the SEC is looking into other transactions. 
After the disclosure, Enron's stock fell almost 21 percent Monday. Tuesday it dropped another 86 cents to close at $19.79. 
The news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on Wall Street that some of Enron's financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that Enron doesn't provide detailed enough financial data about its performance. 
Tuesday morning, Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay held a conference call for investors and analysts, aimed at addressing their concerns. 
It remains to be seen whether he succeeded, but based on the tenor of questions during the call, it's doubtful he achieved that result. 
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, told Lay that the company's credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that Enron's dealings are aboveboard. 
""I, for one, find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions,"" he said. 
Lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships because of the SEC inquiry. 
He did say Enron was aware an ""inherent conflict of interest"" would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with Enron. 
In response, Enron set up procedures, which Lay said were rigorously followed, to ensure shareholder interests wouldn't be compromised. 
""There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron,"" he said, adding that Enron wasn't obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was in Enron's best interest. 
Lay and Enron's board continue to have the ""highest faith and confidence"" in Fastow, he added. 
Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from Wall Street. 
Enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships. 
It took a $35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion as a result. 
During the call Enron executives also addressed other issues. 
They stressed that Enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles, Whitewing and the Atlantic Water Trust, that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or Enron shares at the time of the investments. 
If Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted. 
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston who follows Enron, was among those on the call. He said afterward he received some new information about Enron's lines of credit. 
""I had hoped to get a little bit more out of the call,"" he said.

Busy signal 
Enron should know plenty about bandwidth.
Through Enron Broadband Services, the giant energy company boasts about ""developing an open and efficient market for bandwidth that provides liquidity, reliability, price transparency and guaranteed service levels"". 
But there were no guarantees about service levels yesterday, when Enron held a conference call to ""address investor concerns"" about its financial dealings. 
Despite the bandwidth expertise, the call - the first time that Andrew Fastow, chief financial officer, has faced questions about the transactions from analysts - was available to just 300 lucky telephone diallers. A live webcast of the call was accessible on Enron's website, but without the chance to grill Enron brass. 
Those investors and journalists who did make it through (some waited 20 minutes for their place at the party; others found their lines dropped mid-stream) heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives. An analyst chided for his part in lowering the company's share price was told by Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, that his question quota was up and it was time to move on.

USA: Enron mulls ways to cover portfolio shortfalls-WSJ.

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. Treasurer Ben Glisan said the company thinks it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes sold by investment vehicles it created without having to issue more stock, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Wednesday. 
Enron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those investment vehicles, which could involve issuing additional shares, thereby diluting the position of current shareholders, the report said.
The report, which cites a Tuesday interview with Glisan, said the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities and are coming due during the next 20 months. The entities are known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I Inc, the report said. 
According to the report, Glisan said assets from those entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Enron is selling other assets, the report said. According to the newspaper, proceeds from those sales could go toward repaying the notes, which are ultimately guaranteed by Enron. 
Glisan, according to the report, said it looks like asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of 2002. 
""There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds"" to repay the notes, Glisan said, according to the report. ""But if we are wrong, we will issue equity."" 
According to the report, Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. 
Enron held a conference call on Tuesday, seeking to assuage investor concerns after U.S. regulators said they were looking into transactions involving the company's chief financial officer and its stock shed more than $10 billion in value over the past week. 
Enron said on the call it can tap $3.35 billion from a credit line, suggesting it has enough liquidity to operate its core trading and marketing business, which can experience wide swings in cash flow, depending on commodity prices and market hedges.

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations

10/24/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron (ENE) shares, diluting the position of current shareholders.
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months. 
Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. 
He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. 
""There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds"" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. ""But if we are wrong, we will issue equity."" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. 
Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share.

Enron Corp., the biggest energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750-million loan, ensuring access to credit if the beleaguered company is cut off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter. 
Enron's shares and bonds plunged after the firm said the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its finances.
The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75% this year amid concerns about failed investments, depends on a $3-billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations. 
As a second-tier commercial paper borrower, any ratings drop may cut off Enron from the commercial paper market and raise costs of short-term debt. 
Enron shares dropped 86 cents to close at $19.79 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars over the next 18 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, treasurer Ben Glisan said. The possible shortfall related to about $3.2-billion (U.S.) in notes that related entities sold to investors since 1999, he said. Proceeds from those notes were invested in various Enron assets. Mr. Glisan said those notes come due over the next 18 months and Enron still hopes to sell enough assets to fully repay the notes. However, making up any shortfall with funds raised by selling stock has become more expensive as Enron's share price has plunged. Over the past week, shares of the energy trading giant have fallen more than 40 per cent.

Abreast of the Market
Everest Re, St. Paul and Providian Drop, but Markets Stay Resilient
By Robert O'Brien
Dow Jones Newswires

10/24/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C2
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Stocks ended only slightly lower as the recently resilient market largely withstood the effects of dismal corporate profit statements. 
Shares of drug maker Pharmacia fell $4.37, or 13%, to $38.39, after the company issued third-quarter results that topped Wall Street's forecasts, but also issued 2002 profit projections that left some analysts disappointed.
In fact, several drug companies saw their stock prices fall as investors responded to their quarterly profit statements. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb, for example, gave up 1.68, or 2.8%, to 58.02, American Home Products lost 1.40, or 2.3%, to 58.90, and Schering-Plough eased 74 cents, or 1.9%, to 38.17. 
Shares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in reaction to profit statements, with Everest Re falling 6.40, or 8.4%, to 69.50, and St. Paul dropping 93 cents, or 1.9%, to 49.25. 
Power utility Exelon, Chicago, was set back 3.42, or 7.7%, to 41.08, after its third-quarter results topped forecasts, but drew critical comments from several analysts. 
Nevertheless, even with the grim earnings outlook, investors showed continued reluctance to throw in the towel. 
""Institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the market,"" Richard Cripps, market strategist at Legg Mason, said. ""Their fear is that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly, which is eminently possible, and they can't afford to miss it."" 
Some seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices recently. For many mutual funds, for example, their fiscal year concludes at the end of October. Some are doing what is called window dressing -- buying stocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio -- while others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market. 
Whatever the reason, the market has been making some big moves when prices have risen, and modest moves when they have declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ran up 172.92 points Monday, declined 36.95 points yesterday, a loss of 0.39%, to 9340.08. 
The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 3.64 points, or 0.21%, to 1704.44. Volume levels showed some improvement over Monday's rather sluggish pace. 
Investors haven't completely rolled over. In a handful of the situations in which their ire has been raised, they have lashed those stocks repeatedly. Shares of SBC Communications, one of Monday's disappointments, got punished again, falling 2.62, or 6.3%, to 38.78, and fell back in range of a 52-week low of 38.20, set June 26. 
Consumer lender Providian Financial got sent to a fresh 52-week low, off 41 cents, or 8.3%, to 4.55. Enron, which has fallen on concerns about conflicts of interest in dealings among the company, a power marketer, and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, dropped an additional 86 cents, or 4.2%, to 19.79, hitting a 52-week low intraday. 
There were some winning profit statements. Shares of CSX, for example, rose 2.45, or 7.5%, to 35.19, after the Richmond, Va., rail-freight concern reported third-quarter earnings that, while they fell short of year-ago performance, nevertheless managed to top Wall Street's forecasts. 
Vitesse Semiconductor (Nasdaq), a Camarillo, Calif., maker of integrated circuits used in high-bandwidth communications networks, added 43 cents, or 4.5%, to 9.99, even though the company's losses for its fiscal fourth quarter proved sharper than expected. 
NetIQ (Nasdaq) dropped 4.23, or 14%, to 26.17, even though the Santa Clara, Calif., developer of networking software posted fiscal first-quarter results late Monday that topped what analysts had been looking for. 
Chartered Semiconductor (Nasdaq) advanced 40 cents, or 2.1%, to 19.10. The Singapore chip foundry reported third-quarter results that showed a loss for the period, but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than analysts had projected. 
Shares of several cable-television operators moved higher. Charter Communications added 59 cents, or 4.5%, to 13.62, Comcast gained 40 cents, or 1.1%, to 36.82, and Cox Communications rose 44 cents, or 1.1%, to 40.15. Thomas Weisel Partners said that cable operators should benefit from SBC Communications' decision, revealed Monday with its quarterly results, to scale back the growth of its digital subscriber line service offering. 
EarthLink (Nasdaq) slid 2.51, or 14%, to 14.85. The Atlanta Internet service provider issued stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, but also signaled that its customer growth had slowed. 
AT&T Wireless increased 1.26, or 9.7%, to 14.20. The Redmond, Wash., provider of wireless communications services reported third-quarter results that topped what analysts had been looking for. 
Several steelmakers moved higher following a ruling late Monday by the U.S. Trade Commission, which said it determined that domestic steelmakers have been significantly harmed by cheap imports; the ruling could lead to the erection of barriers limiting steel imports. USX-U.S. Steel Group gained 28 cents, or 1.9%, to 15.02, Nucor rose 1.05, or 2.5%, to 42.87, and AK Steel improved 41 cents, or 4.6%, to 9.31. 
McKesson advanced 1.56, or 4.2%, to 38.95. The San Francisco drug distributor and health-care information technology provider posted stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results. 
Watson Pharmaceuticals fell 3.05, or 6%, to 48.11. UBS Warburg reduced its rating on the Corona, Calif., drug maker, and lowered its earnings projections for the company. 
Furniture Brands dropped 2.04, or 8.9%, to 20.96. UBS Warburg cut its rating on the St. Louis furniture manufacturer, saying it believes the company has lost market share to rival manufacturers.

NEW DELHI -- Following Enron Corp. U.S. energy company AES Corp. has turned to the Indian prime minister for help in settling its grievances with a state government. 
In a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES Corp.'s President Dennis W. Bakke said his company's determination to continue in India is being tested by the government of eastern Orissa state.
A copy of the letter, dated Oct. 1, was made available to the Associated Press. 
AES operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49% of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state. 
AES and Enron are the only major American power companies to make big investments in India since the government allowed foreign investment in the sector in the early 1990s. 
In his letter, Mr. Bakke drew Mr. Vajpayee's attention to the ""expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation . . . and direct interference with day-to-day management"" by the state government and its agencies.

UK: LNG delays could spawn shipping crisis - analysts.
By Pete Harrison

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The transport chain supporting the global LNG industry will be finely poised in coming years between profitability and a crisis of oversupply if projects miss their deadlines, shipping analysts warn. 
More LNG tankers than ever before are being constructed in the shipyards of the Far East, many of them ordered speculatively against anticipated demand, which might emerge later than scheduled.
""The issue is timing,"" Jarle Sjo, shipping equity analyst at Oslo-based investment bank First Securities told Reuters. 
""Historically, LNG projects have been delayed - you can estimate at about six months - and if that happens it will probably get ugly in the short term,"" he added. 
The world fleet of LNG tankers currently numbers 123, but will have swollen by about 37 percent by the end of 2004, according to shipping database Fairplay. 
Gas industry analysts expect some LNG projects to be delayed as a result of the economic downturn, excess capacity at existing plants in Asia and a sharp fall in U.S. natural gas prices this year. 
Svein Erik Amundsen, Managing Director of Norwegian shipping group Bergesen, said that a sustained economic downturn could have ""consequences."" 
""I wouldn't be surprised by project delays,"" he told Reuters. ""This could result in some tonnage coming out of the yards without immediate employment."" 
""I think you can say we're still optimistic, but more cautiously optimistic than before,"" he added. Bergesen has three new LNG ships on order, two of which have already been contracted out to Belgian gas distributor Distrigas. 
STOP AND THINK 
The world's largest and only pure LNG shipping player, Golar LNG, historically bullish in its outlook, has also been forced to stop and consider the problem. 
Golar has six ships locked into long-term contracts, but four more are under construction at South Korea's Daewoo and Hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment. 
""There is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered,"" Golar Executive VP Sveinung Stohle told Reuters, ""The only risk is things might be delayed."" 
Stohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option, but it was also developing an LNG trading arm, which might have a use for some of them. 
Golar's closest competitor in terms of size, Exmar, is taking a more traditional approach. It has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance. 
""We've chartered out all of them except the Samsung ship, which is under offer for the (Qatari) RasGas tender,"" Managing Director Nicolas Saverys told Reuters. Four are booked out to El Paso and one to Enron. 
He said that until all the upcoming projects had their Supply Production Agreements in place, it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship orders. 
""It's a good time to wait,"" said Saverys.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- British Gas has offered India's Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) equity in its exploration acreage in Brazil and a cash settlement in lieu of operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields, the Economic Times reported Wednesday. 
ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) are claiming operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields following Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd.'s 30% stake sale to BG, according to the report.
State-owned ONGC holds a 40% stake in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields and Reliance owns 30%. 
The Enron Oil & Gas stake sale will fall through if BG isn't given the operatorship of the oil fields, Nigel Shaw, vice president of BG India said in the report. 
Shaw said the equity partners are in discussions on the issue of operatorship, the report said. 
British Gas is a unit of BG Group PLC (BRG). Enron Oil & Gas is a unit of Enron Corp. (ENE).

BG Offers ONGC Brazilian Assets to Get Managing Rights in India
2001-10-24 01:12 (New York)


     Mumbai, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- BG Group Plc has offered Oil &
Natural Gas Corp. a stake in exploration projects in Brazil if
India's biggest oil producer allows BG to run the oil fields it
bought from Enron Corp. in India, the Economic Times reported,
without citing any officials.

     BG's purchase of Enron's 30 percent stake in the three oil
and gas areas in India is contingent on winning the right to
manage the developments. Reliance and ONGC, which together own 70
percent of the exploration venture, have both claimed rights to
run the oil and gas fields.

     BG has asked ONGC to waive its right to decide the operator
after Enron quits in return for a stake in its oil and gas sites
in Brazil, the paper said. It didn't give details on the Brazilian
interests BG may offer ONGC. BG has set Oct. 31 as a deadline to
resolve the ownership dispute, the paper said.

     The purchase from Enron would give BG a 30 percent stake in
the Tapti and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, as well as 63
percent of an untapped deposit on the west coast of India. The
assets hold more than 170 million barrels of oil and gas.

     Before agreeing with BG, Enron rejected bids from its Indian
partners, ONGC and Reliance, as well as from the nation's biggest
refiner, Indian Oil Corp.


House stimulus bill would give billions to huge companies; Senate Democrats present alternative

WASHINGTON (AP) - General Motors, IBM and Kmart are among corporations that would receive billions of dollars in tax refunds under a $100 billion House Republican economic stimulus package. Democrats say it is far too generous to companies and does too little for individuals. 
Seven companies would get a total of $3.3 billion in refunds of alternative minimum taxes they paid as far back as 1986. The tax, which the House legislation also would repeal outright, is intended to ensure a basic minimum income tax is paid by companies and individuals that claim numerous deductions and credits.
IBM would get a $1.4 billion refund, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, while GM would get $832 million, Kmart $102 million and General Electric $671 million. Others specified for big refunds include energy giant Enron, at $254 million; U.S. Steel, $39 million; and grocery chain Kroger, $9 million. 
In addition, the study found that Ford Motor Co. would get a refund that could total $2.3 billion, while Chevron's could reach $314 million. 
Counting repeal of the tax, corporations would get more than $25 billion in tax relief from these minimum tax provisions in 2002 alone. In addition, the bill would make permanent a temporary tax break for financial services firms doing a lot of overseas business, providing them $21 billion in tax relief over 10 years. 
The generous corporate tax breaks are among the most contentious items in the House GOP measure, scheduled for a floor vote Wednesday. Democrats say the measure is certain to change once it reaches the Senate; the Bush administration also has signaled that $100 billion is too costly. 
""It's clear the House bill cannot pass the Senate as it is,"" said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. 
For individuals, the House legislation includes a new round of tax rebate checks for workers who didn't get them this summer and a cut in the current 27 percent income tax rate to 25 percent in 2002, four years earlier than under the just-enacted tax cut. The measure also reduces capital gains rates from 20 percent to 18 percent for most taxpayers, enhances business equipment write-offs and allows companies to deduct current losses against taxes paid five years earlier. 
The primary sponsor, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, said in a newspaper opinion piece published Tuesday in USA Today that the legislation ""is a shot of adrenaline"" that will help restart the economy while not triggering inflation. 
""Businesses generate jobs, and jobs are the core of a strong economy,"" wrote Thomas, R-Calif. 
While bipartisan support backs some of the House items, Senate Democrats have been pushing for expanded unemployment benefits and help for workers who lose health insurance. Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, presented a $70 billion proposal Tuesday that would extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks, provide a 50 percent federal match for COBRA health insurance policies and allow more workers to qualify for Medicaid. 
The legislation also includes rebate checks and some business items similar to the House bill but not the capital gains reduction or the alternative minimum tax relief. Tax cuts in the Baucus measure would total $35 billion in 2002, far below the House GOP level. 
""This proposal appropriately responds to the sign of the times, helping this nation get back to work and recover quickly,"" said Baucus, D-Mont. 
Other Democrats were working on spending programs. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he was putting together a $20 billion package that included hiring extra customs and border agents and food inspectors, augmented security at nuclear plants and purchase of more vaccines. 
Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said President Bush does not want the stimulus bill laden with additional spending. 
""Everything in this package needs to be stimulative,"" Grassley said. ""There needs to be more done on the investment side.""

LUSKIN: All right. 
CALLER: Hey Don I like to know as far as Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) is concerned, how representative of the energy sector is this because I`ve been watching as a small investor that`s kind of brand new, watching it just kind of plummet. So and I`m only investing a little bit every month in it but you think that`s pretty wise idea just kind of keep on doing small investments? 
LUSKIN: Well as a general investing strategy yes but Enron is a special case where we have a company that`s in bad trouble. We had a CEO who basically left without explanation a couple of months ago, then yesterday the CFO has been accused of some pretty strange looking self dealing issues. We don`t know how that`s going to resolve but this is a company under a cloud so you might want to hold off on your buying program until that cloud lifts a little bit. 
FRANCIS: All right Don, thank you very much; we appreciate it. Don Luskin.

UK: Enron to shed metals staff, part of wider cuts.
By Andy Blamey

10/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Commodities trader Enron Metals plans to shed jobs as part of a Europe-wide staff reduction programme which should see the Enron Group cut 250 to 500 European jobs in total, the company said. 
""We have around 5,000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our headcount here by between five and 10 percent,"" John Sherriff, president and CEO of Enron Europe, said in a statement.
Enron Metals employees in London were told at a meeting on Tuesday that staff cuts of 10 percent to 20 percent would be required, trade sources said. 
The company is seeking volunteers to take redundancy, but if sufficient voluntary slots have not been filled by a deadline of October 19, Enron will opt for compulsory cuts, they added. 
An Enron spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the official statement. 
""Enron's business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth,"" Sherriff said in the statement. 
""It is prudent for us to keep both a close eye on our costs and to continually review the skills and resources that are available to use to ensure that they are deployed in a way which will maximise earnings,"" he added. 
Market sources were not surprised by the move, citing testing conditions facing the metals trading sector as a whole. 
""At the moment you have low volumes of customer interest combined with difficult trading conditions and high operating costs,"" said one. 
""Even if they're making money from EnronOnline, they've got far too many people there."" 
U.S.-based Enron Corp became a major player in the metals trade in May last year when it acquired MG plc, a leading independent international metals dealing firm in London which had previously absorbed fellow LME ring-dealers Rudolf Wolff & Co and Billiton Metals Ltd. 
The number of LME ring dealers trading on the exchange's open-outcry floor has dwindled from a peak of 30 in the mid-1980s to the current 12. 
This could drop to 11 this week if ScotiaMocatta, a subsidiary of Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia , exits floor trading from Friday. 
In an interview with Reuters in August, Enron Metals President Joe Gold reiterated the company's commitment to the LME ring. 
""We send our No 1 trader and No 2 trader down on the (LME) floor every day, which is not a statement everyone can make. Wherever the most trading is during that day, that's where we'll be,"" Gold said. 
SCREEN TRADING 
Enron has also become a major player in metals screen trading since July last year, when the company announced the first physical metals transaction on its internet trading platform EnronOnline (www.enrononline.com). 
The system differs from the screen trading systems operated by the London Metal Exchange (LME) and UK-based metals and energy broker Spectron in that the trading platform is open to a broad range of users but Enron is the sole counter-party in each transaction. 
At the end of August the company amended EnronOnline to make markets for selected clients only in three months copper and aluminium for maximum 200-lot transactions, compared with the standard 20-lot markets on the system. 
In addition to metals, EnronOnline trades a range of products, from oil to plastics and emission allowances to credit derivatives. Enron announced the one millionth transaction on the system in May of this year.

Enron Plans to Trim as Many as 500 Jobs in Europe (Update2)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, plans to eliminate as many as 500 jobs in Europe,
or as much as 10 percent of the workforce there, to reduce costs
and boost profit.

     The company has 5,000 workers in Europe, and it plans to trim
jobs by 5 percent to 10 percent, Enron said in a statement. The
company wants to make reductions through ``voluntary severance,''
the statement said.

     Houston-based Enron expanded European commodities trading in
2000 when it bought London-based MG Plc, the largest copper
marketer, for $448 million. Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned as
Enron's chief executive in August, told investors in July to
expect ``great things from Europe in the future.''

     ``There is still a lot of growth for them in Europe,'' said
Louis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. ``They're not
giving up, they're just taking an analysis of each unit.''

Gagliardi doesn't own Enron shares. John S. Herold doesn't issue
investment recommendations.

     Enron Europe is based in London and has offices in nine other
countries. Along with trading, it has interests in power plants in
Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey and the U.K. It didn't say where the
job cuts would be.

     Shares of Enron rose $1.81 to $35.20. They have fallen 58
percent this year.



Northeast Officials Seek Delay In Unifying Power Market
By Kristen McNamara
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/10/2001

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Officials in Maryland and New York have urged federal energy regulators to slow down plans to merge the three existing wholesale power markets along the Eastern Seaboard into a single market for the entire Northeast. 
Citing concerns that rushing to consolidate the markets could create instability, reduce liquidity and inflate prices, the New York Independent System Operator and the Maryland Public Service Commission have separately asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to study its plan before implementing it.
""There's no need to do this in a hasty manner,"" said Steve Sullivan, spokesman for the New York ISO, which runs that state's power market and transmission system. ""Our markets are not broken."" 
FERC is pushing utilities across the country to put their high-voltage transmission systems - the wholesale power market's equivalent of the interstate highway system - under the control of independent regional operators. The commission says the handoff is critical to the establishment of competitive power markets, as utilities with positions in the market are seen as unlikely to allow competitors equal access to the grid. 
Power traders like Enron Corp. (ENE) support the effort, while some utilities and state regulators have opposed the assertion of federal authority. 
In an effort to jump-start the sluggish process, FERC has outlined a plan to divide up control of the country's power grids among four regional operators - one each in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest and West. 
But while utilities still control much of the grid elsewhere in the country, transmission systems in the Northeast are already run by three independent wholesale market operators. FERC has told those operators to merge, and has indicated a preference for modeling the new market on that run by Mid-Atlantic operator PJM Interconnection LLC. 
A unified Northeast power market would be the world's largest - processing $9 billion in energy sales a year, handling 110,000 megawatts of electricity and serving a population of 54 million, according to the New York ISO. 
Seeking Other Options 

The Maryland Public Service Commission, along with regulators from Virginia and the District of Columbia, filed motions in August to stay FERC's order, saying the commission had overstepped its authority. 
The Maryland regulators will ask a federal court to block FERC if it moves forward with its plans to consolidate the three market operators - New York ISO, ISO New England Inc. and PJM - said Robert Harris, the commission's assistant manager of external affairs. 
The commission last week asked U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski. D-Md., to require FERC to explore options to ease the flow of power between markets short of a forced consolidation. 
""This proposal is unnecessary, reckless and risky,"" the PSC wrote. 
The PSC held public hearings on a unified Northeast power market Oct. 3 and 4, and plans to send the comments it received to FERC next week. 
The New York ISO and ISO New England said they aren't opposed to a consolidated market, as long as it incorporates the best practices from each of the three existing markets. 
The New York ISO, along with ISO New England, also wants each of the three regional markets to have equal representation on the board governing the merged market. 
New York's market operator also questioned whether centralizing control of a Northeast power market with one operator in one location would increase its vulnerability to electronic or other attacks by terrorists. 
FERC will hold a series of workshops next week to discuss issues related to the development of independent transmission operators across the country, including the need to clear bottlenecks and guard against attempts to manipulate the market. 
As reported, new FERC Chairman Pat Wood III said the commission will spend a day listening to the concerns of state regulators. The commission has also agreed to study its contention that consolidating markets will pay off for consumers, Wood said. 
Mirant Corp. (MIR) recently commissioned a study that showed a combined Northeast power market could save consumers $440 million a year.

INDIA: Reliance plan could sour BG's Indian deal.
By Sriram Ramakrishnan

10/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 10 (Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries Ltd wants to become the operator of three oil and gas fields off the country's west coast, complicating U.K.-based BG Plc's proposed acquisition of a 30 percent stake in the fields, an industry source told Reuters on Wednesday. 
Reliance, which owns a 30 percent stake in the fields, has applied to the government to be appointed the operator, said the source, who declined to be identified.
That could potentially derail the deal BG announced last week to buy U.S.-based Enron Corp's 30 percent stake in the offshore Indian energy fields for $388 million. 
Numerous reports in the Indian media have said that the deal may be contingent on operatorship of the fields being transferred from Enron, the current operator, to BG. 
A spokesman for BG in London said on Wednesday that the company was ""continuing discussions with the other parties"" and until the matter was resolved, it had no further comment to make. 
Indian state-run driller ONGC, which owns the remaining 40 percent stake in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti fields, has already said it wants to take over the operatorship. 
The source said Reliance Industries, India's leading petrochemicals maker and flagship company of the country's largest business group, is also pursuing management control. 
Panna, Mukta and Tapti lie off India's western coast, and are considered among the more promising recent finds in the country. 
Panna and Mukta produce 29,000 barrels of oil and 2.5 million cubic metres of gas per day. 
The Mukta field produced 1,974 million cubic metres of gas in the year ended March 2001. 
BG said it wants a stake in the fields to complement its Indian interests in gas distribution and liquefied natural gas (LNG). 
Enron wants to leave the venture as a part of its move to focus on the high-growth energy trading business.

USA: El Paso shares advance after favorable ruling.

10/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A favorable regulatory ruling sent El Paso Corp's undervalued shares soaring on Wednesday, leading the utility group higher in morning trading. 
After the close of trading Tuesday, a U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission law judge ruled there was no clear evidence that El Paso exercised market power in an attempt to raise California natural gas prices and recommended dismissal of the issue in the case pending before the full commission.
This was ""not a clean sweep"" for the big gas pipeline company, UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone said, noting Judge Wagner believes there was affiliate abuse - or collusion - between El Paso's pipeline and marketing segments during California's power crisis late last year and early this year. 
But Barone believes ""the net outcome from his decisions are a substantial positive for El Paso and have significantly reduced the company's limited exposure to this highly politicized California mess."" 
In active morning trading, El Paso shares traded between $51 and $51.69 - their best prices since Sept. 17, the first day of trading following the interruption caused by the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. 
After two hours, El Paso was up $2.50, or 5.13 percent, to $51.25 on composite trading of 1.8 million shares. 
Following it higher were the stocks of several other companies that had dropped on news of California's problems - Calpine Corp. , up 4.14 percent; Enron Corp. , up 3.26 percent, and Dynegy Inc. , up 2.4 percent.

UK: UPDATE 1-ScotiaMocatta seen to axe LME ring trade from Friday.
By Martin Hayes

10/10/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - London Metal Exchange (LME) ring-dealer ScotiaMocatta Metals is to scale back its operations, and will no longer execute business on the market's open-outcry floor after Friday, trade sources said on Wednesday. 
ScotiaMocatta is a unit of Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia , who informed metal traders of the move at a meeting held yesterday in the LME trader's London offices. Voluntary redundancies were also asked for, sources at the meeting said.
""They said they are restructuring the business, and will no longer execute trades on the floor after Friday,"" one said. 
This implies that ScotiaMocatta, which is one of 12 ring-dealing members (RDMs) on the LME, could relinquish this status, although sources at the meeting said this was not made clear. 
No-one from ScotiaMocatta in London was available to comment on Wednesday. 
Separately, Enron Group said its commodities trader Enron Metals would also lose jobs as part of a Europe-wide staff reduction programme. 
On Tuesday, Bank of Nova Scotia said in Toronto it was scaling back its base metals trading desk and laying off traders, transforming ScotiaMoccata into a ""niche player"", due to the economic downturn. 
The bank said the decision does not affect its precious metals division. 
Bank of Nova Scotia purchased Mocatta Metals as it was known in September 1997. It is also one of the five members of the twice-daily London gold fix - it is the oldest bullion dealing house in the world, dating back to 1671. 
""We are still staying in the base metals business, but it will be more focused as a niche player in structural products,"" Scotiabank spokeswoman, Diane Flanagan told Reuters in Toronto. 
Flanagan confirmed there would be layoffs at the bank's base metals desk, but refused to say how many employees would be affected. 
If ScotiaMoccatta were to give up RDM status, it would bring LME ring-dealing numbers down to 11. The RDMs are the only firms entitled to trade on the open-outcry floor. 
In the LME's tiered membership, associate broker clearing members (ABCMs) are the second tier of membership - they have all the rights and privileges of LME membership, but cannot trade during the open-outcry trading sessions. 
LME director of corporate affairs Jonathan Haslam said on Wednesday that any announcement about a firm's membership status would have to come from the company concerned. 
DOWNTURN IN METALS BUSINESS HITTING HARD 
Trading conditions in base metals have deteriorated this year, with prices, volumes and revenues all falling, against a background of a global economic slowdown, worsened by the September 11 attacks on the U.S. 
This climate has hit all trading companies, and ScotiaMocatta's business has declined markedly, sources said. 
""They have gone from a position of being on the acquisition front to becoming a niche player. That highlights the way their business has declined in the last six months,"" a source close to the company said. 
There had been persistent talk that ScotiaMoccata had been looking to acquire other LME RDMs. In 2000, it sought to buy RDM Rudolf Wolff, a unit of Canada's Noranda. Wolff was eventually purchased by MG Trading, now known as Enron Metals 
This year it was said to be negotiating to buy another RDM, although that ultimately came to nothing. 
LME RING DEALING NUMBERS CONTINUE TO FALL 
LME ring-dealership numbers have declined since the mid-1980s, when there were some 30 companies on the floor. This is partly due to consolidation, but also due to some firms relinquishing their status in the wake of the Sumitomo Corp copper scandal in 1996. 
Now, there are significantly more ABCMs and the trend towards consolidation and contraction is likely to continue, as their costs are much lower than being a ring-dealer. 
To run a floor operation, with telecommunications and associated staff charges, probably costs between one and two million stg a year.

UNDERSEA PIPELINE PLAN FACES SCRUTINY ; HEARING SLATED ON ENRON PLAN TO IMPORT GAS
David Fleshler Staff Writer

10/10/2001
South Florida Sun-Sentinel
Broward Metro

(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)

State environmental regulators have raised sharp questions about Enron Corp.'s plans to construct an undersea natural gas pipeline from the Bahamas to South Florida. 
The pipeline would threaten coral reefs, travel through a popular state park and face a series of hazards in the commercial bustle of Port Everglades, according to a memorandum by the Department of Environmental Protection's southeast district staff.
The Houston-based company wants to bring natural gas from a plant in Freeport, Grand Bahama, to Fort Lauderdale. With more gas-fueled power plants in the works, the company thinks it would find a market in Florida. 
El Paso Corp. and AES Corp. also have proposed undersea pipeline projects, although Enron's Calypso project has moved the furthest in the approval process. Judging from the state's comments on Enron's proposal, all three projects will face difficult questions over their safety and environmental impact. 
Just before it reaches land, for example, the pipeline would pass through Port Everglades, a busy center of commerce that could be full of peril for a high-pressure gas pipeline. 
""The pipeline will be routed through an area that has experienced chronic disturbances such as dredging, ship groundings, high ship traffic entering and leaving Port Everglades and storm events,"" states the memo, prepared by Jayne Bergstrom, an environmental specialist who prepared a series of questions for the company. 
""Large vessels have caused significant damage to Broward County reefs in recent years, including a 506-foot cargo ship, a freighter driven ashore during a February 1998 storm, a 348-foot Panamanian vessel that washed ashore a month later, and incredibly, a 360-foot nuclear-powered sub, the USS Memphis, in February 1993. Is this the safest route for a high-pressure gas pipeline?"" 
Enron spokesman John Ambler said the pipeline probably would be 30 to 40 feet below the sea floor in the port, well protected even if a ship sank or ran aground directly over it. Just outside the port, the pipeline would ascend to 3 feet below the floor, but that would be in a rocky area that's closed to ships, he said. 
""We're in the process of developing a response to all of these questions,"" he said. ""We're in an ongoing dialogue, and we're optimistic about being able to resolve these concerns in a way that will allow the project to move forward."" 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will conduct a public hearing tonight on the environmental impact of the Enron project. The public will be allowed to make comments or ask questions of the agency's staff. 
The meeting will be at 7 p.m. at the I.T. Parker Community Center, 901 NE Third St., Dania Beach. 
As the pipeline approaches Broward County's coastline, it would pass through bands of coral reefs, important habitats for marine life. The company plans to drill horizontally under the reefs to avoid harming them. But it also would drag pipes over them in two areas before inserting them through the holes, according to the state. 
""Coral reefs deserve protection for their intrinsic natural value,"" the memo states. ""In addition, the economic, tourism, fishing and recreational resources of South Florida depend on healthy coral reef ecosystems. Calypso staff and engineers have not sufficiently demonstrated to staff that the project cannot be redesigned to avoid sensitive marine resources."" 
While the company has stated that the impact would be both temporary and insignificant, the memo states that the company has not explained how this could be so. The state estimated that the project would have an impact on about 15 acres of coral reefs and adjacent habitats. 
Given the damage the reefs already have suffered from pollution and other sources, the memo questions whether any pipelines should be routed directly to southeast Florida. Instead, it says it may be better to route them to the north, through areas without reefs, then connect to the pipeline system on land. 
Ambler said that the company was trying to find ways to avoid dragging the pipes along the reefs. 
All three pipeline projects will be reviewed by a series of federal, state and local agencies.

Reliance Bids to Run Indian Oil Fields, Challenging BG Plan

Reliance Bids to Run Indian Oil Fields, Challenging BG Plan

     Mumbai, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Reliance Industries Ltd.,
India's biggest private company, said it claimed the right to run
three offshore oil and gas projects, challenging a bid from the
U.K.'s BG Group Plc.

     BG has said a plan to buy out Enron Corp.'s 30 percent of the
projects is contingent on winning the right to oversee the
developments. Reliance and Oil & Natural Gas Corp., India's
biggest oil producer, together own 70 percent of the exploration
company and have an option to decide the operator after Enron
quits, Reliance spokesman Yogesh Desai said.

     The purchase would gave BG a 30 percent stake in the Tapti
and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, as well as 63 percent of an
untapped deposit on the west coast of India. The assets hold more
than 170 million barrels of oil and gas. BG declined to comment.

     BG will invest ``hundreds of millions'' of dollars to double
production in the Tapti field by 2004 if the other two partners in
the venture contribute as well, Nigel Shaw, chief executive
officer of BG India Pvt. told reporters last week. ONGC has
already claimed its right to operate the fields.

     Before agreeing with BG, Enron rejected bids from its Indian
venture partners, ONGS and Reliance, as well as from the nation's
biggest refiner, Indian Oil Corp.

     India's gas production fell 11 percent to 1999 from 1997 as
Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the state explorer, made no significant
discoveries in 15 years. Insufficient supplies of gas have hurt
growth in the country's fertilizer and chemicals industries and
hampered upgrading of its power plants, still mostly coal-fed.

     The government expects a gas deficit to triple in the next
six years unless new wells are drilled or existing fields expand
sales.

     Domestic bureaucracy has already thwarted efforts in India by
Electricite de France and Cogetrix Energy Inc., which have pulled
out, while Enron is locked in a price dispute with authorities.
The government is the sole buyer of gas and power from producers
and the sole seller to distributors.


LME Says Scotiamocatta to End Open-Outcry Floor Trade (Update2)

LME Says Scotiamocatta to End Open-Outcry Floor Trade (Update2)


     (Adds bank quotes in second, fifth paragraphs.)

     London, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- The London Metal Exchange said
Scotiamocatta, a metals-trading unit of the Bank of Nova Scotia,
will cease open-outcry transactions on the LME floor.

     It was not immediately clear when the company will end floor
trading, said Caoimhe Buckley, a spokeswoman for the exchange, the
world's biggest metals-trading bourse. The bank is planning to cut
about 20 base metals staff in London, said Pam Agnew, a
spokeswoman in Toronto, though its floor dealing is unaffected for
now. ``At this time, it's business as usual,'' she said.

     Scotiamocatta is the latest defection from the LME, whose
number of floor traders has more than halved to 11 in the past
decade because of declining margins. This year, the price of
copper has dropped 23 percent and aluminum has declined 17 percent
as slowing economies cut demand and reduce trading commissions.

     ``It detracts from (the LME's) standing as a marketplace
because it's another one gone,'' said Richard Starsmeare, head of
commodity and trade finance at Raiffeisen Zentralbank in London.

     The bank's decision to cut its London metals staff is related
to the ``downturn in the economy,'' Agnew said.

     The LME's director of corporate affairs, Jonathan Haslam,
later said the exchange couldn't officially comment on
Scotiamocatta's role at the exchange.

     ``The LME wishes to make clear that it has made no formal
statement about the position of the Bank of Nova Scotia,'' Haslam
said in a statement. ``Any statements about their future trading
must come from them.''

     The LME's other floor-trading members, or ``ring dealers''
include Enron Metals Ltd. and Refco Overseas Ltd.


Bin Laden 'look alike' arrested in India
BBC News
October 9, 2001
By Frances Harrison in Delhi 
Indian police detained a bearded man in the western border area of Rajasthan on suspicion that he might be the world's most wanted man, Osama Bin Laden. 
The man was released after two hours of questioning which established that he was in fact a Hindu and also worked for an American company. 
Police in the town of Jaisalmer bordering Pakistan said they saw a man with a flowing beard and black scarf driving along the national highway in a jeep. 
They chased the man, took him to the police station and politely asked who he was - clearly concerned they might have apprehended Osama Bin Laden fleeing Aghanistan via Pakistan. 
US company 
The bearded man told the police he was an engineer working with the American company Enron on a wind energy project in the area. 
A telephone call to the company confirmed this and one policeman told the man that he should be thankful he wasn't living in the United States because he would have definitely been shot so strong was his resemblance to Osama Bin Laden. 
The man, who turned out to be a Hindu and not a Muslim, was freed immediately. 
But not before a crowd of curious villagers had gathered outside the police station eager to catch a glimpse of the man who's been dominating the news.

"RE: Plan B","In addition I think that Jennifer Shipos ( originally slated for Tx marketing) will be better suited to return to the Derivatives group.  That being the case, Tom, Barry, Brian and I agree that we should extend an offer to Morris Larubbio.  If Gary and Morris accept, that will complete the 2 marketing slots for Texas.

Louise, with mark smith out, I'd like approval to go to plan B which would be to extend an offer to Gary Brian. How do we go about doing this? 

This move is supported by Tom Martin, Vickers, and Tycholiz. By cc to Chis - any objections?

Subject:	Re: Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy  

I have done a lot of thinking these past few days and have decided to share my thoughts with you and the board of directors. I mean, after all, FACTS are friendly....Right?!

I have had the utmost respect for Enron and the board for all of my 23 years - thru mergers and name changes and cuts and all the ups and downs. Let me just stop beating around the bush, and just get down to the bottom line here.

I, like everyone else out here have some questions and comments for you. I want you to get down to our terms and answer these in layman's terms - we understand pistons & crankshafts and nuts & bolts, so please keep all of you acronyms out of it.

Where in the world did you get the questions for the MergerQ&A?
Someone has messed around with our retirement, our livelyhood and our families!
Do you really think we give a flip about what Enron field is named?
Do you really think we care if the Enron body shop stays open?
Do you really think we care about the United Way right now???
NO! We have been cheated out of money here! Have you ever put a pencil to it? - Probably not, since your wages total in the $MM figure!

Let's just do that, let's figure out what a measley 1000 shares calculates to before and what it will be upon the merge!
1000 X $80+ = $80,000+ - early 2001
1000 X $40 = $40,000 - mid 2001
1000 X .2685 = 268.5 X let's say... $40 = $10,740 - next year
Ouch! And that is a comparison to our stock - NOT  our stock OPTIONS!

I and everyone else out here want to be compensated for what has happened - you had guys bailing out with $30+MM. They will be sitting high on the hog and we have people looking at a measley $15,000 plus the thought of losing their jobs with the merger.

How ironic that the Code of Ethics is sent out immediately after your merger e-mail! Does the board of directors EVER read that document??? We read it MANY times a year!! Perhaps you should practice what you all preach!

Have you had a stranger walk up to you on the street and ask ""What have YOU done to the stock?""
Well, that is happening out here! What have we done to deserve this treatment? Nothing, but cut ourselves down to the meanest, leanest teams around only to have something like this slapped in our faces.

I am ashamed, embarrassed, and MAD.

1. What happened?
2. Who did it?
3. We want compensation

What should I say now? Hmmm....
GO DYNEGY

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

I would like to go ahead and request some days off for the upcoming holidays, if it is still possible.

Wed, October 31st
Wed, November 21st

I realized how much vacation I have remaining, and I might as well see if I can get off these days if there's coverage.  I guess just let me know how it all turns out.

"Re: Schedules to PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT","It is my understanding from a discussion we had with Tom and David that the EEX contract, which is a fixed price deal with ENA, is not going to HPL. and should not be listed on Schedule 4.13 (v).  Instead, ENA will sell to HPL the EEX gas at index.  There needs to be a contract put into place that reflects the sale from ENA to HPL and that contract will be listed on Schedule 4.13 (v).  We have agreed to provide AEP with the amended and updated schedules on Monday the 15th, so we should go ahead and get this documented now.   Barbara--who typically puts together gas purchase agreements like this?   Please call if you have any questions.

Sandi,

Attached is an excel spreadsheet which serves to update Schedule 4.13 (v) to the AEP Agreement covering Material Contracts.  The list reflects information in Enron's Global Contract System as of April 30, 2001 and covers business which will be conducted after June 1, 2001.  We direct your attention to Column AB of the spreadsheet:  those contracts which were included on the April 2000 6th Revision of Schedule 4.13 (v) are noted by their numerical designation in that Schedule; those contracts which cover deals traded subsequent to 3/15/2001 (the cutoff for the earlier Schedule) are so noted; and, those deals which were considered during our prior reviews but excluded from the final April 2000 6th Revision of the Schedule for various reasons are so noted with an explanation in the Comments Column, AC.

The April 2000 6th Revision cites 3 purchase contracts with Forrest Oil Corporation; while we included 96007597 and 96048499 on the spreadsheet attached, we could find no justification for also including 96049286 on the list.  You may have other information which supports including 96049286 on the schedule

The attached excel spreadsheet includes the EEX E&P Company, L.P. fixed price contract, 96054930, done by the Enron Finance Group for 4/2001 thru 12/2004.

George and Sandi,
	In response to George's Schedules to PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT, we need to make two changes to the existing list.  The first being Entex Gas Resources Corp. global number 96053954.  This was entered in Global as a GTC which was entered as a bogus contract and number.  Dan Hyvl will prepare a Transaction Agreement covering the period of April 1, 2001 through October 31, 2001, Sitara Deal #528936.  This Transaction is part of an existing contract already in place between ENA and Entex Gas Resources Corp, therefore we did not add to our Supplemental Schedule to Stock Purchase Agreement.
	The second change being Exxon Mobil Corporation, global number 96021964.  This deal was done as a Sales under a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement between HPL and Mobil Oil Corporation, effective 12/1/2000 which was not captured in Global.  This agreement is now in Global with the number being 96055715.  
	Everything else has been captured and on our schedules.  If you have any questions, please call.

Thanks, Kim

Kim,
Please look at this and obtain copies of all referenced agreements. They should all be brand new (could be transactions under existing masters). Once we've done that, we need to list as we did the other material contracts for the Triple Lutz schedules. Call with questions

thanks,

Sandi, the attachment list the 16 contracts which need to be added to the Material Contracts Schedule as a result of our review of all deals entered from 11/15/2000 to 12/27/2000.  In addition, the correct Spinnaker (Ranger) contract is now 96047295, not the GTC formerly cited, 96046001.

SEC Seeks Information on Enron Dealings With Partnerships Recently Run by Fastow
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A3
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. said it has been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking information on the energy giant's controversial dealings with partnerships that were set up and run until recently by its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. 
Following Enron's announcement yesterday morning of the SEC inquiry, the company's stock took another big slide, falling more than 20% in New York Stock Exchange trading. As of 4 p.m., Enron shares were trading at $20.65, off $5.40, knocking about $4 billion off Enron's market capitalization. Volume topped the Big Board's most-active list at about 36 million shares. A week ago, Enron stock was trading at about $33 a share. Subsequently, the company announced a $1.01 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 million loss.
Analysts also voiced concerns yesterday about possible other bad news lurking amid Enron's vast and extremely complex operations. The company has dealings with a number of related entities. Under certain circumstances, if Enron's credit rating and stock price fall far enough, the company would be obligated to issue tens of millions of additional shares to these entities, diluting the holdings of current shareholders. 
Enron has previously acknowledged the provisions but said its business is strong and it feels confident that there will be no defaults. 
In a statement, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the company ""will cooperate fully"" with the SEC inquiry and ""look(s) forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest."" Enron has consistently said that it believes its dealings with the Fastow-related partnerships were proper and properly disclosed. The company has said it put billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership-related transactions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions. 
The SEC inquiry came from the agency's Fort Worth, Texas, regional office. According to a person familiar with the matter, this would indicate that the inquiry comes from the SEC's enforcement arm, as opposed to its corporate-finance section. The participation of the enforcement branch would indicate that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of securities law. However, enforcement-branch inquiries often don't produce any allegations of wrongdoing. It also appears that the SEC hasn't yet taken the step of launching a formal investigation, which would be a sign that the agency believes securities laws might have been violated. The SEC declined to comment. 
Certainly, there have been questions and concerns about those partnership transactions, which contributed to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last week as part of Enron's efforts to unwind the deals. Mr. Fastow, who has declined repeated interview requests, resigned from the partnerships, known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, in late July in the face of rising conflict-of-interest concerns by Wall Street analysts and major company investors. 
Since then, internal partnership documents have shown that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of Enron associates made millions of dollars last year in fees and capital increases as general partner of the LJM2, the larger of the two partnerships. 
Mr. Fastow's partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside Enron, according to people familiar with the matter. For instance, these people say, sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999, Enron Treasurer Jeffrey McMahon went to company president Jeffrey Skilling and complained about potential conflicts of interest posed by Mr. Fastow's activities. Mr. Skilling didn't share Mr. McMahon's concern, these people say, and Mr. McMahon requested and received reassignment to another post. 
Mr. Skilling resigned as Enron president and chief executive in mid-August, citing personal reasons and the fall in Enron's stock price, which peaked at about $90 a share last year. Mr. McMahon and Mr. Skilling haven't responded to repeated interview requests. 
Investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in Enron's dealings with other related entities. In some cases, Enron could be required to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if certain so-called double trigger provisions occur. 
For example, last July Enron helped create the Marlin Water Trust II, which sold $915 million in notes that are due July 15, 2003. However, Enron can be considered in default, in advance of that date, if its stock price falls below $34.13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to below investment grade by either Moody's Investors Service or Standard & Poor's. 
Currently, Enron debt is still investment-grade at both ratings agencies and would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment grade category. Last week, Moody's put Enron on review for a possible downgrade. However, observers believe that even if Moody's lowers Enron's rating, the company will still be investment-grade.

Where Did the Value Go at Enron?
By FLOYD NORRIS
New York Times
What really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen?
Wall Street has been puzzling over that since Enron (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ENE>) released its quarterly earnings a week ago. Yesterday shares in Enron plunged $5.40, to $20.65, after the company said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions.
The reaction was in some ways puzzling. Given the questions that have been raised since the earnings announcement - some of them prominently featured in The Wall Street Journal - it was likely that the S.E.C. would begin a preliminary inquiry.
Whether it will go farther than that is not clear, but if nothing else the slide in Enron shares over the last week shows the hazards that can confront a company that allows word of a major reduction in its balance sheet value to dribble out. Enron's shares rose 67 cents, to $33.84, last Tuesday, as investors first reacted to the earnings announcement. But since then they have fallen $13.19, or 39 percent.
The $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity was not mentioned in a news release Enron issued on its quarterly earnings last Tuesday. It was briefly mentioned in a conference call with analysts, but many of the listeners seem to have not noticed that, wrongly thinking Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, was referring to a $1 billion write-off that was disclosed in the earnings release.
When questions were asked in the following days, the explanations were less than thorough. Enron explained that the reduction in shareholders' equity was related to the termination of ""structured finance vehicles"" involving partnerships that had been controlled by the company's chief financial officer.
""Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more clarity about how the company goes about its business,"" said Ralph Pellecchia, a credit analyst at Fitch Investors Service. He added that the issue of the company's ""credibility related to this transaction really seems to have a life of its own.""
Enron declined yesterday to allow any officials to be interviewed about its financial reports. But last night it said Mr. Lay would hold another conference call with investors at 9:30 a.m. today. 
The company's earlier disclosures regarding the partnerships baffled many analysts. They referred to such things as ""share settled costless collar arrangements"" and ""derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent nature of existing restricted forward contracts."" The disclosures said the company entered into the transactions ""to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets.""
It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them, even though the underlying assets included investments that declined in value. The Wall Street Journal, citing reports the partnerships made to institutional investors, has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash distributions to their investors. Enron officials in recent days have refused to discuss the arrangements in any detail.
One of the questions that the S.E.C. may look into is whether the termination of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item, or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earnings. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.
Under accounting rules, a company's transactions in its own shares cannot produce profits or losses, whatever the effect on cash flow. So a company that sells its shares for $10 each, and buys them back at $50, or at $1, will report no earnings effect. Enron said that the reduction to shareholders equity, and a related reduction in notes receivable, ""is the result of Enron's termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods.""
Stephen Moore, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service who has put Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, said that while some of the details were not clear, ""Essentially, Enron's promise was that a certain amount of Enron's shares would be worth $1 billion. The shares plummeted, and they were not"" worth that much.
Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings, which leaves out some expenses, and directs attention away from its balance sheet, which is disclosed only in S.E.C. filings, not in the earnings news release. The reduction in shareholders' equity would be shown only on the third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released.
Earlier this year, Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, reacted strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to provide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released. He called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners. Mr. Skilling later resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr. Lay, the chairman and former chief executive, took back the latter title.
While Enron was riding high, its often difficult-to-understand reports were generally seen as not being a problem. The company appeared to be the dominant force in the business of energy trading, and to be able to produce phenomenal profits. When Mr. Lay was reported as having played an important role in formulating the Bush administration's energy policies, the aura was only enhanced. In January, the shares traded for $84.
But now, with some of the company's ventures clearly having run into problems, it appears that investors are growing less willing to accept the company's reports. That the partnership transactions were disclosed at all was because of the involvement of the chief financial officer, and some have wondered if there might have been similar deals with others.
Mr. Lay has promised to make the company's financial reports easier to understand, and last week's report was at first praised by some analysts for doing just that.
In a news release yesterday, Mr. Lay said the company welcomed the S.E.C.'s request for information. ""We will cooperate fully with the S.E.C. and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest,"" he said.

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION: SEC probes Enron over financial dealings 
Financial Times; Oct 23, 2001
By JULIE EARLE, JOHN LABATE and SHEILA MCNULTY

Enron, the US energy giant, disclosed yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission had asked it to provide financial information at the start of an informal inquiry. 
The announcement follows a rapid sell-off in the stock in reaction to Enron's surprise revelation last week of a Dollars 1.2bn charge to equity to eliminate the dilutive effects of closing one of its controversial financing vehicles. 
In revealing the SEC call for more detailed information ""regarding certain related party transactions"", Enron hopes to counter growing criticism that it should be more transparent. ""We welcome this request,"" said Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer. ""We will co-operate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest."" 
The SEC probe into Enron's financial dealings is an informal one at this stage, according to the company, and the request for documents is voluntary. However, SEC probes often begin lightly as investigators gather information on an issue. 
Such a probe could turn into a formal investigation at any time. In that case, regulators would be armed with subpoena powers and could demand certain documents be handed over. The SEC would not confirm or deny the existence of the Enron probe. 
Mr Lay did not say which transactions the SEC was reviewing, although analysts believe they relate to Andrew Fastow, Enron chief financial officer, who has been reported to have run a limited partnership that bought assets valued at hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron. 
Analysts say the transactions, while controversial because of Mr Fastow's links to the company, have been disclosed. What concerns them, however, is how Enron valued the assets involved. www.ft.com/energy

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: Group full of surprises after failing to open up 
Financial Times; Oct 23, 2001
By SHEILA MCNULTY

Ronald Barone joked he would have to get plenty of rest ahead of Enron's results last week, noting the US energy company's reputation for producing what some analysts say is the most complicated of earnings reports. 
The UBS Warburg analyst was, nevertheless, as ill-prepared as his peers for the announcement of a Dollars 1.2bn charge to equity to eliminate the dilutive effects of closing one of its controversial financing vehicles. 
The news overshadowed Enron's on-target 26 per cent increase in third-quarter earnings per share, sending the stock plunging. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's subsequent request for more information about Enron's financial activities has reinforced analyst perceptions that the company should have been more transparent in its reporting. 
Curt Launer, of Credit Suisse First Boston, says expectations for more disclosure had built up over the past two months. Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman, had promised to be more forthcoming when he resumed the duties of chief executive following the resignation of Jeff Skilling in August. 
While Mr Lay did improve Enron's disclosure by creating headings for new business segments and providing more detail within each of them, the Dollars 1.2bn charge still caught the market off guard. 
""It came as a surprise to us,"" said Stephen Moore, of Moody's Investors Service. ""We should have been informed that it was there."" 
Mr Barone found it disturbing that Enron disclosed the charge in ""a fleeting comment"" during its conference call with analysts and did not mention it in its nine-page news release. 
""Despite progress in other areas, there appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved,"" he said. 
Enron contends that ""we did disclose it in the conference call, and it was one of the first points raised in the Q and A session (on the conference call)"". 
Mr Lay has pledged to co-operate with the SEC's request, which appears to be part of an informal inquiry rather than an official investigation. In the meantime, he adds, Enron will focus on its core businesses. 
That is something analysts say Enron has strayed too far away from. Ray Niles of Salomon Smith Barney says the company's core franchise - its wholesale business - is doing well. Most of Enron's problems have arisen from stepping out of this area. 
""They need to come clean on the financial effects of all of their off-balance sheet financing,"" Mr Niles says. ""Investors want to see clear, easy-to-understand financial information."" Moody's has placed Enron's Dollars 13bn in debt securities on review for possible downgrade and Mr Moore believes there is potential for more write-offs. 
Enron is embroiled in a legal dispute with an Indian state electricity board over a power project and is one of several energy traders facing questions in California over accusations of a manipulation of power prices - a charge it denies. 
Analysts say its UK businesses are not seeing big multiples, and Enron says it only expects to take Dollars 200m in ""goodwill"" versus Dollars 5.7bn on its books.

Enron Discloses SEC Inquiry 
Information Request Involves Ties to Money-Losing Partnerships 
Washington Post
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, October 23, 2001; Page E03 
Enron Corp. shares sank more than 20 percent yesterday after the Houston energy company disclosed a Securities and Exchange Commission request for information about Enron's ties to outside investment partnerships set up by the company's chief financial officer.
The SEC would not comment on its action, which Enron spokesman Mark Palmer called an ""informal inquiry,"" not an investigation. ""We welcome this request,"" said Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive of the Houston-based company.
But the announcement jarred investors' confidence in the giant energy-trading company, already hurt by the unexpected resignation of chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling in August, and heavy losses from investments in broadband Internet and other technology ventures.
""A lot of people threw in the towel today,"" said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan in New York.
The SEC request was made privately last Wednesday, the day after Enron reported a $1 billion write-off of investment losses and restructuring charges from unsuccessful technology ventures and other operations. The write-offs left Enron with a $618 million loss in the third quarter (84 cents a share).
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that $35 million of the write-off was tied to losses at limited partnerships established by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, and run by him until July.
Enron told investment analysts last week that it had repurchased 55 million shares of its stock held by the partnerships that Fastow had directed, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Fastow set up several investment partnerships with the approval of Enron's board. The partnerships engaged in billions of dollars in complex financial transactions involving Enron and made major investments in power plants and other assets alongside Enron.
An Enron shareholder has filed suit in Texas state court alleging that Enron's board violated its duty to the company by permitting the chief financial officer to engage in the outside transactions that allegedly earned millions of dollars in fees for himself and other investors in the partnerships. What Enron received from the relationships is not clear.
Feygin said that the company had informed analysts about the limited partnerships, which offered Enron a way to take positions in strategic but uncertain technology ventures without detailing the outcomes in its public financial statements. 
""In hindsight, that was an error in judgment. I don't think it was an error in principle,"" the analyst said.
Enron could have revealed the SEC inquiry last week but did not disclose it until yesterday, and for many investors, that was the last straw, Feygin said.
The stock closed yesterday at $20.65, down $5.40, as 36 million shares changed hands.

Enron Suffers After Unclear Disclosure, New York Times Says
2001-10-23 06:31 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission's decision to look into some Enron Corp.
transactions and the company's recent decline in value show what
can happen when a company lets a major reduction in its balance
sheet dribble out, Floyd Norris of the New York Times reported in
his column, citing analysts.

     Investors are concerned as to how Enron reduced shareholders'
equity by $1.2 billion and why this was not mentioned in a news
release the company issued with its quarterly earnings last
Tuesday, the paper said.

     Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21 percent yesterday after the
Houston-based company said the Securities and Exchange Commission
requested information on partnerships run by Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives. Enron created
partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets
such as power plants to lower the debt on its books.

     ``Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more
clarity about how the company goes about its business,'' said
Ralph Pellecchia, a credit analyst at Fitch Investors Service,
according to the Times.

SEC asks Enron for investing data 
Stock price declines as regulators seek details on partnerships 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Shares in Enron Corp. fell almost 21 percent Monday after the company disclosed federal securities regulators asked for details on investment partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer. 
The request covers transactions between Enron and two private partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, that did business with Enron. 
The partnerships entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements with Enron. 
Enron declined to say if the SEC's request -- which it called voluntary and said represents an ""informal inquiry"" -- included other issues. 
The SEC request, made by fax Wednesday to Enron and followed up with a call Thursday, comes as the Houston-based energy trader was already fighting to put a series of problems behind it and regain credibility with investors and analysts. 
""It's further bad news, further question marks related to Enron in general and this transaction specifically,"" Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank Securities in New York, said of the SEC request. 
Some investors prefer to sit on the sidelines until the issue clears up, Meade said, adding: ""The level of uncertainty with this stock has gotten pretty high."" 
An SEC spokesman declined comment. 
Enron's Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, managed both of the LJM partnerships, according to SEC filings made by Enron last year. 
Both partnerships are described as investment companies that primarily buy or invest in businesses involved in energy and communications. 
Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM partnerships in June amid criticism and questions from some on Wall Street about a potential conflict of interest. 
Investors worried Monday that Fastow's duty to Enron shareholders competed with his duties to LJM, Meade said. 
In a written statement Monday, Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive officer, said the company welcomed the SEC's request. 
""We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest,"" said Lay, who reassumed the duties of CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned unexpectedly in August. 
Enron said its external and internal auditors and attorneys reviewed the arrangements, its board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements, which were disclosed in Enron's SEC filings. 
The issue drew renewed interest from investors and analysts after Enron released third-quarter earnings last Tuesday. 
During the quarter, Enron took $1.01 billion in one-time charges to reflect losses in its broadband, retail electricity and water investments. 
The amount also included $35 million related to ""early termination"" of Enron's relationships with the LJM partnerships. 
During a call with analysts the same day, Enron said it recorded a $1.2 billion reduction to shareholder equity, or the shareholders' ownership stake in the company, as part of the LJM termination. 
Enron declined to answer questions Monday about the LJM entities, including those about their relationship with Enron or Fastow's role with them. 
The day after Enron's third-quarter earnings release, the Wall Street Journal ran the first of three articles highlighting the LJM partnerships, Fastow and Enron. 
The Journal's Friday report said LJM2 ""realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it did with Enron,"" and that ""Fastow, and possibility a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees."" 
Shares in Enron, which closed last Tuesday at $33.84, ended the day Friday at $26.05. Then Monday, shares in Enron dropped by $5.40 to close at $20.65. 
Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan in New York, believes there were no improprieties surrounding LJM. 
""From inception, the LJM situation was obviously one that would raise eyebrows,"" said Feygin, adding Enron anticipated that and made sure proper legal structures were in place. 
The LJM entities are what's known as off-balance sheet financing vehicles, he said. Generally, they allow a corporation to take on financial obligations without having to report them as liabilities. 
Feygin also said it appeared Enron intended to give Fastow an ""opportunity to participate in the upside from these entities"" to reward him. 
Even though the LJM transactions have been disclosed by Enron, Meade noted that they are complicated, difficult to follow and their implications tough to understand. 
In transactions detailed in an SEC filing made by Enron last year, LJM Cayman received shares of Enron common stock and LJM2 acquired assets from Enron. 
Another filing last year said LJM Cayman and/or LJM2 acquired various debt and equity securities of certain Enron subsidiaries and affiliates. 
Investors are also concerned about potential shareholder lawsuits as well as equity commitments facing Enron from two other financing vehicles called Whitewing and Marlin, Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston, wrote in a research note Monday. 
If Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, those equity commitments from Whitewing and Marlin could trigger steps that would cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted. 
At least two shareholders have already sued Enron's board in state district court, while two law firms filed suit on behalf of Enron shareholders Monday in federal court seeking class-action status. 
Carol Caole, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, downgraded Enron from a buy to a hold Monday primarily because of issues surrounding the credibility of Enron's management. 
Several times over the past six months, Caole asked specific questions of senior Enron executives, she said. They denied problems existed, but six weeks to two months later it was revealed there were, indeed, issues, she said. 
Coale recently asked about an SEC investigation and was told there wasn't one. But, she said, it turns out it's an ""inquiry,"" not an investigation.

Minnesota Mining and GM Climb In a Rally That Builds Late in Day
By Robert O'Brien
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- During yesterday's Wall Street rally, investors responded with accommodation toward the release of third-quarter earnings results and fourth-quarter forecasts. 
Shares of Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing added $5.22, or 5.1%, to $107.39 after the manufacturing company released third-quarter earnings, which narrowly edged out analysts' projections, and spoke frankly of the challenges the company continues to face this quarter in light of economic weakness.
Despite this kind of hesitation about the economy's outlook, investors gravitated toward some of the manufacturing and capital-equipment stocks that tend to struggle during periods of weak economic activity. Shares of General Motors, for example, added 1.21, or 2.9%, to 42.57, Alcoa gained 1.16, or 3.7%, to 32.83, and Fluor, an engineering and construction company, rose 1.79, or 4.2%, to 44.77. 
Stock averages initially struggled for direction, reflecting some skepticism about the sustainability of the market's recent success, before turning firmly higher in the final two hours of trading. Trading levels thinned out, as well; on the New York Stock Exchange, less than 1.1 billion shares changed hands, compared with 1.2 billion shares Friday, an options-expiration session. 
Nevertheless, market averages posted impressive gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average improved 172.92 points, or 1.88%, to 9377.03. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 36.77 points, or 2.2%, to 1708.08. 
""We had another one of those days where there is a lack of liquidity, so any moves, in either direction, just get exaggerated,"" Bob Basel, senior trader at Salomon Smith Barney, said yesterday. 
Shares of semiconductor companies, including makers of both chips and chip-making equipment, rose sharply after a spending forecast from Intel, the leading chip maker, proved less grim than some experts had anticipated. The company said its capital spending could be cut 10% to 20% in 2002 from this year's levels; that wouldn't be as severe as some chip industry experts had forecast. 
Shares of Applied Materials advanced 2.22, or 6.8%, to 34.77 on Nasdaq, while KLA-Tencor gained 2.74, or 7.5%, to 39.25, and Lam Research improved 1.36, or 7.8%, to 18.80, all on Nasdaq. Among chip makers, Analog Devices rose 2.57, or 7.1%, to 38.74, LSI Logic gained 89 cents, or 5.6%, to 16.83, and Texas Instruments tacked on 1.17, or 4.2%, to 28.91. For its part, Intel rose 1.15, or 4.8%, to 25.30 on Nasdaq. 
Shares of Lexmark International dropped 5.58, or 11%, to 44.77. The Lexington, Ky., maker of computer printers reported third-quarter results that matched Wall Street's forecasts, but warned that it continues to face sluggish demand in the fourth quarter. 
SBC Communications declined 2.24, or 5.1%, to 41.40. The telecommunications service provider reported third-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' forecasts, and warned that the company won't show ""meaningful growth"" next year. 
Citrix Systems fell 4.14, or 16%, to 21.08 on Nasdaq. Dain Rauscher reduced its rating on the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., maker of computer networking products, saying the company faces competitive pressures from products introduced by rival vendors. 
Jabil Circuit eased 16 cents, or 0.7%, to 22.90. The St. Petersburg, Fla., contract electronics maker adopted a so-called shareholder rights plan, which is aimed at preventing an acquirer from gaining control of the company. 
EMC advanced 68 cents, or 5.9%, to 12.19. The Hopkinton, Mass., maker of data-storage systems signed what was described as a multibillion-dollar enterprise storage agreement with Dell Computer. Dell improved 50 cents, or 2.1%, to 24.55 on Nasdaq. 
SeaChange International advanced 88 cents, or 3.6%, to 25.03 on Nasdaq, boosted by an upbeat research note from Dain Rauscher, which said the Maynard, Mass., provider of video-on-demand technology figures to have posted an upbeat quarter. 
Lucent Technologies declined 20 cents, or 2.8%, to 6.90. UBS Warburg, in a research note, expressed some caution about the outlook for the telecommunications equipment maker's quarterly results. 
Emerson Electric gained 1.38, or 2.8%, to 50.27, even though the St. Louis manufacturer, which makes electronics and telecommunications products, among other product lines, reduced its earnings guidance for fiscal 2001. 
Enron lost 5.40, or 21%, to 20.65, setting a 52-week low. The Houston energy trader, whose stock has weakened since recent articles in The Wall Street Journal raised questions about the company's relationship with two limited partnerships organized by its chief financial officer, said it had received a request for information on Wednesday from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding some of its transactions with those partnerships.

WORLD STOCK MARKETS: Wall St bargain hunters counter earnings gloom AMERICAS 
Financial Times; Oct 23, 2001
By MARY CHUNG

US equities rose sharply yesterday with bargain hunting in technology stocks countering a slew of mostly disappointing corporate earnings and more anthrax scares. 
Gains accelerated late in the session as the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 172.92 to close at at 9,377.03 while the S&P 500 index added 16.42 at 1,089.90. The Nasdaq Composite rose 36.78 at 1,708.09. Volume remained light with 1.1bn trades in the NYSE. 
Investors were upbeat in spite of a lack of positive news, suggesting underlying strength in the market and optimism for a rebound, some analysts said. The indices were slightly rattled after news that two postal workers in Washington died after suffering symptoms consistent with anthrax, but the market quickly regained its footing. 
""The market is acting very well. It's come an awful long way in a short time and had to deal with anthrax,"" said Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards. ""The message is that investors and consumers and the country are in a recovery mode."" 
Semiconductor stocks showed strength with Intel up 4.7 per cent at Dollars 25.30 and Advanced Micro Devices 4.2 per cent at Dollars 9.58. 
Microsoft rose 3.9 per cent at Dollars 60.16 before the launch this week of its Windows XP operating system. Lexmark dropped 11 per cent at Dollars 44.77 after the company reported third-quarter results that met estimates, but warned of a fourth-quarter revenue shortfall. Applied Digital Solutions gained 66 per cent at 58 cents after the company said it had formed a subsidiary to develop and market its ThermoLife thermoelectric generator product powered by body heat. 
3M gave a lift to Dow components, up 5.1 per cent at Dollars 107.39 after the maker of Post-it notes said quarterly earnings beat expectations by a penny a share. The company forecast fourth-quarter profit would be in line with analyst estimates. 
SBC Communications was the biggest decliner within the Dow, down 5.1 per cent to Dollars 41.40 after it said earnings failed to meet Wall Street consensus estimates. 
American Express gained 3.4 per cent to Dollars 30.32 despite reporting a 60 per cent drop in third-quarter earnings. 
Dow components Citigroup and JP MorganChase tacked on 2.5 per cent and 4.2 per cent respectively. Shares in Alcoa were up 3.7 per cent at Dollars 32.83 and ExxonMobil 1.4 per cent at Dollars 41.12. 
Enron fell 20.7 per cent at Dollars 20.65 after the energy trading company said the Securities and Exchange Commission requested it voluntarily provide information regarding certain transactions. 
In Toronto the S&P 300 composite index fell just 0.08 per cent to 6,905.21 at the close.

Milberg Weiss Announces Class Action Suit Against Enron Corp.

10/22/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2001--The law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP announces that a class action lawsuit was filed on October 22, 2001, on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Enron Corp. (""Enron"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:ENE) between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive. A copy of the complaint filed in this action is available from the Court, or can be viewed on Milberg Weiss' website at: http://www.milberg.com/enron/ 
The action, numbered H013630, is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, located at 515 Rusk Street, Houston TX 77002, against defendants Enron, Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling and Andrew Fastow. The Honorable Melinda Harmon is the Judge presiding over the case.
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the price of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron issued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Services Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Company's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of the Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring charges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently, Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period, Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally-held Enron common stock to unsuspecting investors. 
If you bought the common stock of Enron between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, you may, no later than December 21, 2001, request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. A lead plaintiff is a representative party that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Under certain circumstances, one or more class members may together serve as ""lead plaintiff."" Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. You may retain Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP, or other counsel of your choice, to serve as your counsel in this action.

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) will hold a conference call at 9:30 a.m. EDT Tuesday to address investor concerns, the company said in a press release Monday. 
Earlier Monday, a shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit against Enron alleging the board breached their fiduciary duties by allowing Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships.
Last week, Enron said it received a request for information about ""certain related party transactions"" from the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
On Oct. 16, Enron announced that it would take a $35 million charge relating to the limited partnerships and revealed that the company had to repurchase 55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnerships, thereby reducing the company's shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. 
Shares of Enron closed Monday at $20.65, down $5.40, or 20.7%, on New York Stock Exchange volume of 36.4 million shares. Average daily volume is 5.8 million shares. In intraday trading, the shares reached a 52-week low of $19.67. The previous 52-week low was $24.46, reached on Sept. 27.

Janus Had Biggest Enron Stake at End of 2nd-Quarter (Update1)

Janus Had Biggest Enron Stake at End of 2nd-Quarter (Update1)

     (Adds Stilwell shares at bottom.)

     Denver, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Janus Capital Corp., whose
stock funds have lost more than a third of their value this year,
may get another jolt from Enron Corp.

     As of June 30, Denver-based Janus was the biggest
institutional holder of Enron, owning 42.8 million shares, or a
5.71 percent stake in the largest U.S. energy trading company,
according to Thomson Financial/Carson.

     Enron shares have fallen 39 percent over the past four days
on concern that the company's dealings with partnerships run by
its chief financial officer contributed to investment losses. The
Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information on
the partnerships, Enron said.

     Janus, which boosted its Enron stake in the past year in an
effort to diversify its technology-heavy stock funds, is among a
handful of firms including Putnam Investments, Alliance Capital
Management, Barclays Global Investors and Fidelity Investments
that owned more than 2 percent of the Houston-based company as of
June 30, according to Bloomberg data.

     ``It was definitely a real growth darling,'' said Christine
Benz, a senior analyst at Chicago-based fund tracker Morningstar
Inc. ``In a year like 2000, when almost nothing was working for
growth managers, Enron emerged as a story that a lot of growth
managers could like.''

                           Fund Holdings

     According to Thomson Financial, 1,187 mutual funds, or 15.4
percent of all U.S. stock funds, owned a combined 207.9 million
Enron shares as of June 30. Combined losses on the holdings amount
to $2.7 billion since Tuesday.

     According to the latest available data compiled by Thomson,
the biggest fund holders of Enron were: Janus Fund, with 2.15
percent; Janus Twenty Fund, with 1.19 percent; Alliance Premier
Growth Fund, with 1.14 percent; American Century Ultra Fund, with
1.01 percent; Janus Mercury Fund, with 0.88 percent; Vanguard 500
Index Fund, with 0.82 percent; Fidelity Magellan Fund, with 0.73
percent; AIM Value Fund, with 0.6 percent; CREF Stock Account,
with 0.58 percent; and, Putnam Investors Fund, with 0.52 percent.

     Janus Fund has lost 33.2 percent this year through Friday,
while Janus Twenty Fund has lost 33.4 percent and Janus Mercury
Fund has fallen 34 percent. A Janus spokeswoman wasn't immediately
available to comment.

     Morningstar's Benz said she suspects Janus fund managers have
already begun trimming their Enron positions.

     Enron shares had fallen 59 percent this year before last
week's news on concerns about financial reporting and money-losing
investments outside energy trading, such as trading space on
broadband telecommunications networks and building water treatment
plants.

     The stock fell $5.40, or 21 percent, to $20.65 in New York
trading today.

     ``Anecdotal evidence that I'm hearing from the fund managers
there is that they had been trimming pretty aggressively,'' said
Benz. She added that it's ``difficult to make the assertion that
they are in the clear.''

     Janus Capital is owned by Kansas City, Missouri-based
Stilwell Financial Inc., whose shares gained 73 cents today to
$22.52. Stilwell shares have fallen 43 percent this year.


Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update9)

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update9)

     (Adds information on conference call in 26th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21
percent after the Houston-based company said the Securities and
Exchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships and
other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power
plants to lower the debt on its books. An investor sued Enron's
board Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35
million and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict of
interest.

     Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may be
forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the
owners in cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he
may be have to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies
if Enron's debt ratings fall too far.

     ``We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't go
below investment grade,'' said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John
Hancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.

     Enron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when it
repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled
by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journal
reported last week.

     Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors today.

                           Shares Plunge

     Enron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65. They touched $19.67 during
the day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.

     The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about
failed investments in trading of space on fiber-optic
communications networks and a water company, and the resignation
of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.

     While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons,
investors say his departure led them to question whether the
company was concealing problems, including possible liabilities
from affiliated companies.

     On Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a
$618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01
billion in failed investments.

     Moody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watch
for possible downgrade. The company's debt is rated at investment
grade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.

     The company received a faxed request for information from the
SEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmer
said, and will respond ``as soon as possible.''

     ``We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to
the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to
rest,'' Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.

                          Dilution Fears

     Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing
vehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texas
secretary of state. Fastow and other Enron executives are named as
the controlling partners or the board members in the companies.

     Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removing
the debt for those projects from Enron's books. That allows Enron
to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting
what it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debt
analyst Todd Shipman said.

     Enron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and other
commodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gas
pipelines.

     Dismantling the affiliates would be costly. Whitewing
Management, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power
plants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000
preferred shares of Enron.

     Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common
stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit
rating drops below investment grade, according to company filings.
That would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment.

     ``The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are
out there?'' Shipman said. ``Investors are worried they might have
to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they
originally thought.''

                        Worrisome Financing

     Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's
``related party arrangements,'' the board approved them, and they
were disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.

     That hasn't eased concerns. The reduction of shareholder
equity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to
worry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, the
Salomon analyst. Enron also may take another $2.4 billion in
losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and
projects in South America, he wrote.

                            Bonds Fall

     Enron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per
$1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 on
Friday, traders said. Yield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from
6.33 percent.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade.

     Fastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him,
Palmer said. Fastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman Karen
Denne said. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the
agency's request to Enron.

     ``We believe everything that needed to be considered and done
in connection with these transactions was considered and done,''
Lay said in the statement.

     Enron will hold a conference call to discuss investors'
concerns at 9:30 a.m. New York time Tuesday. The call may be
accessed through the ``Investors'' section of Enron's Web site at

Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance
By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>

Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) stock plunged 20% last week after the energy giant revealed that a complex financing deal caused a $1.2 billion hit to its equity. But other big deals that have yet to receive much public scrutiny could further damage the company's balance sheet. 
In the spotlight last week were transactions done with investment partnerships called LJM2 and LJM Cayman. An examination of the LJM2-related equity writedown can be found here. 
However, the LJM deals make up only part of Enron's sophisticated financing arrangements. Also at issue are two large trusts that contain assets Enron shifted from its balance sheet. These are the $1 billion Marlin Water Trust II and the $2.4 billion Osprey Trust, usually known as Whitewing. 
The key risk for investors is how Enron chooses to repay these trusts if they don't unwind as planned. The company may end up issuing stock to repay money borrowed through the trusts. This would dilute existing shareholders. Alternatively, Enron could resort to using cash raised through sales of on-balance sheet assets. But this would hamper efforts to reduce debt and deprive the company's profitable business lines of much-needed capital. 
Whitewing and a Prayer?
Though set up by Enron, Marlin II and Whitewing are legally distinct from the company. Institutional investors bought notes issued by the trusts. The $3.4 billion in proceeds from the notes flowed to Enron. 
Both trusts are scheduled to unwind in 2003. Originally, Enron had hoped to repay them by selling the trusts' underlying assets. This repayment method would have had a minimal impact on Enron's balance sheet. 
However, there's a potential problem brewing with this approach. The value of the assets may be too low to raise sufficient funds to pay back the trust investors. Hence Enron's two unenviable options: issuing stock, or raising cash from its own balance sheet. 
Enron treasurer Ben Glisan concedes that assets in Marlin II won't be sufficient to pay it back. But he adds that proceeds from planned sales of on-balance sheet assets will provide Enron with the necessary funds for Marlin II. When asked if Whitewing's assets are adequate for repayment, Glisan replied: ""We believe so."" 
In reference to the two trusts, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay said on a conference call Tuesday: ""We anticipate the sale of assets will be the primary source of repayments."" 
Sterling Marlin
TheStreet.com hasn't seen offering documentation for Whitewing; Enron didn't provide it when requested. But TSC has reviewed the Marlin II prospectus. Here's how Marlin II works. Enron took water assets, primarily based in the U.K., off its balance sheet, and the Marlin II trust took a stake in them. Meanwhile, Marlin II issued senior debt to investors, the proceeds of which went to Enron. The company didn't have to recognize these notes as debt on its balance sheet, due to the structure of the trust. Marlin II replaced a similar trust called Marlin that was set to mature at the end of this year. 
Ideally, the aim was for Enron managers to maximize the value and profitability of the assets over the life of Marlin and Marlin II so it could sell them off and pay down the trusts. To cover the risk that asset sales wouldn't raise enough money, Enron also pledged to issue as much new convertible preferred stock as might be needed to pay off the notes. 
As it happened, the water assets didn't perform well. In fact, Enron set up Marlin II in July to succeed the original Marlin because it wanted to avoid paying off the first Marlin with convertible stock, or with cash from its own balance sheet. This move risked angering the rating agencies that had agreed not to treat Marlin as debt because of Enron's pledge to backstop it with preferred stock. Suddenly, it seemed Enron was wriggling out of its commitment to make good with stock. 
Enron's Glisan responds that many of the investors in the first Marlin also invested in Marlin II, illustrating that investors weren't upset by the maneuver. 
Glisan says Enron almost certainly won't decide to issue stock to pay off Marlin II. Instead, he adds, money from pending asset sales can be used to pay it off when it matures in July 2003. When asked if Enron might use the expected $1.9 billion in proceeds from selling Portland General, the utility based in Portland, Ore., Glisan replied: ""That's a good one."" 
But using the Portland General windfall would run counter to Enron's frequently stated strategy of selling off low-yielding assets and investing the proceeds in higher-yielding businesses. Portland General is almost certainly a more profitable business than the U.K.'s Wessex Water, which is the dominant asset in Marlin II. In addition, doing so would mean Enron couldn't use all the Portland proceeds to pay off debt. Enron aims to get its debt-to-total-capital ratio down to 40%, from the current 50%. 
Maturity
What about Whitewing, which matures in early 2003? Glisan lists Whitewing's assets as: Central American gas distribution assets; turbines destined for European power stations; interests in European power stations; and various debt and equity participations in energy investments. Glisan says these assets can be sold to pay off the $2.4 billion in notes issued by the trust. 
But what would happen if the Whitewing assets can't fetch the necessary price? Enron could sell off more on-balance-sheet assets. But, again, this wouldn't help debt-reduction efforts, and it may be running short of large assets that it can quickly sell. 
Whitewing is backed with Enron convertible stock. But Enron may be reluctant to issue paper when its stock is so far below recent highs, and current shareholders may begrudge the prospect of further dilution. 
Investors also need to keep their eyes on the early-repayment triggers of the trusts. In fact, the stock price-related element of the triggers has already been set off. For Whitewing, the stock has to fall below $59.78; for Marlin II, the stock has to be under $34.13. However, something else has to happen before the trust investors can claim their money back through asset sales and stock issuance. Enron's credit rating must fall below investment grade. That looks to be a long shot, since its rating is currently three notches above subinvestment grade. But it is something the market will watch after Moody's said last week that it was putting Enron on review for a possible downgrade. 
Despite all the questions stemming from the trusts, Enron still seems keen to use the structure. Last week, Barclays Capital was inviting investors to subscribe to an Enron-related entity called the Besson Trust. This is being set up to enable Enron ""to monetize substantially all of its interests in EOTT Energy Partners,"" an Enron affiliate that markets and transports crude oil. Expected proceeds from the deal are $227 million, according to the prospectus. Could Enron be setting up new trusts to pay off damaged old trusts? 
Due to off-balance sheet financings like Marlin II and Whitewing, it's clear that uncertainty could weigh on Enron's battered stock for some time. 




Why Enron's Writedown Unnerves Some Investors
By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>

Enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors, but its decision to reduce equity by $1.2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and confusion in the market. 
The action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner. More important, investors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect Enron's balance sheet, profits and earnings guidance. 
Enron didn't provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction. 
Enron doesn't include a balance sheet in its earnings release, so the equity decrease couldn't be spotted in numbers supplied Tuesday. And even though Enron did break out $1 billion in earnings charges in its release, the company didn't feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in the text. 
Instead, the public first heard about it on a Tuesday conference call. CEO Kenneth Lay said Enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a so-called ""structured finance arrangement."" The Wall Street Journal later reported that Enron's counter-party in this transaction was an investment partnership called LJM2 Co-Investment, which has set up and run by Enron's finance chief, Andrew Fastow. 
This is what Lay said on the Tuesday call about the equity move: ""In connection with the early termination, shareholders' equity will be reduced approximately $1.2 billion, with a corresponding significant reduction in the number of diluted shares outstanding."" According to The Journal, Lay then said Wednesday on another call that Enron had repurchased 55 million shares. 
Enron's supporters count Lay's mention of a reduction in the share count as bullish, because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future. 
But there are two possible problems with this theory. 
First, Enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to make $2.15 per share in operating earnings next year. Critically, the company did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the 55 million shares or not. If the forecast does assume the exclusion of the 55 million shares, the company should have upped its 2002 per-share earnings forecast by around 6%, since that's the amount by which the share count will be reduced. Enron needs to say what share count it's using in its guidance. 
Second, it's almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever recorded, casting a certain amount of doubt on Lay's assertion that the share count will come down. 
Why question the CEO? Well, in its 2000 annual report, Enron included some disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with LJM2. It reads: ""At December 31, 2000, Enron had derivative instruments...on 54.8 million shares of Enron common stock."" The derivative instruments appear to be types of options, or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stock at agreed prices. 
But these derivatives-linked shares don't show up where they should in the annual report: in the table that breaks out the difference between the basic and diluted share counts. The line item in this table that shows options-related shares totals only 43 million shares, which is close to the amount of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion. Therefore, that number almost certainly doesn't include the 55 million LJM2-related shares. The fact is, at least some of the 55 million derivatives-linked shares should be included if the derivatives were like normal options. That's because the LJM2 derivatives appear to have been ""in the money"", or profitable for the holders. Typically, all in-the-money options-based stock has to be included in the diluted share count. And these LJM2 derivatives did appear to have that status at the end of 2000. Back then, Enron stock was trading around $80, way above the average $68 level at which these derivatives made money for LJM2. 
Maybe these weren't simple options and had other conditions attached that excluded them from the diluted share count. That's what disclosure elsewhere in the annual report appears to imply. Alternatively, the options were embedded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure, though it's hard think where. 
Presumably, investors will get a full explanation in Enron's quarterly financial results filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, due by the middle of November.

No word yet on when the phones will get terminated.....As for the rates, they are going to essentially remain the same, even for terminated employees, as in they will still get bonus minutes.  The 10% off, however, for the corporate phones will not be there.
Do you want me to fax you a rate sheet?

"RE: Waha HubCo","Waha HubCo:

Linda are you going to be working on this as you are the primary interface to this producer? If not let me know.  Dave, lets  get together to discuss the following action plan.

Actions:

Linda R. (?):
1.	Get the confidentiality agreement in place
2.	Get analytical support to create an economic model for Waha HubCo and define the value for Enron.
3.	Scope out roles and responsibilities of the parties

Dave O./Tom H.:
1.	Lead discussions with Sid R. and TW on physical interconnection options

Brian:
1.	Work with Daren F. to define physical interconnection and supply objectives for Enron and HubCo
2.	Work with Tom M. to define trading/info objectives for Enron and HubCo
3.	Work with Jim S. to define storage objectives for Enron and HubCo.

Regards,
Brian



I will get the confidentiality agreement established.

Brian,

I have forwarded your e-mail to the people in our shop that will be working
most directly on this project.  Tom Hodges has talked with Kerry Puckett in
our BD group.  They have set a meeting up for Tues. 10/02/01.  We can setup
a confidentiality agreement if you want, that would probably allow us to
discuss storage options in the area more freely.  Since you are out today
I'll see if I can't get Rick Moncrief to send over a form of Agreement we
have used, they all look pretty similar.  As far as deal structure I'm
pretty open on how we setup, but am definitely interested in equity
partnership/JV.  As this is our core area of assets we wish to continue to
be actively involved in deals that we believe add value.
I believe there is significant potential to create a trading platform
utilizing our combined assets as well as the liquidity SRES's system supply
could create at an expanded Waha Hub.

Rick's group will be taking the point on this project and will coordinate
others involvement as necessary within our company.

We look forward to working with you and your team on this project.

Thanks 
Mitch

Mitch:

A lot has happened since we last met - but I wanted to get back to you
on our Waha Hubco project.  I have attached an initial presentation on
the topic and have asked our engineers (Dave Owen and Tom Hodge) to get
in touch with Brad to look at the physical interconnection options.  We
are doing the same with TW and it would be good to understand more about
your system and your objectives.  I would also like to understand your
thoughts on the commercial structure and terms you would (or would not)
like to work with Enron on this.  

I suggest a Confidentiality Agreement would be appropriate as a starting
point and if you like I can forward one for your review.

Regards,
Brian

"**IMPORTANT** Stack Manager Users","
We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)

USA: UPDATE 1-Energy casts some light in gloomy profit season.
By Per Jebsen

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy and mining companies have provided a few glimmers of light but otherwise third-quarter results on Monday and Tuesday are helping to fulfill expectations for the worst quarter in 10 years. 
Technology bellwethers Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which reported sharply lower profits, did little to buck the downward trend.
FirstEnergy Corp. , an owner of electric utilities in northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected 18 percent increase in earnings, citing increased electricity sales and lower costs. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. reported a third-quarter profit that reversed a year-earlier loss, due to higher gold production. 
Yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule. Top chipmaker Intel said on Tuesday after the close of exchanges that profits tumbled 77 percent as it suffered from slowing global economies and weak personal computer sales. PC maker IBM announced its first quarterly earnings decline since the end of 1999 as weak sales continued to weigh on profits. 
Energy giant Enron Corp. posted a quarterly loss after taking $1.01 billion in charges. Companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls, including Caterpillar Inc. , the world's largest maker of construction equipment, and Unisys Corp. , a computer company. 
""The earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly, and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point,"" said Michael Holland, who runs the $65 million Holland Balanced Fund. 
FOCUS NOT ON EARNINGS 
""The focus (for investors) has been and continues to be outside of earnings, that is, the war on terrorism specifically,"" he said. 
Dynegy Inc. , a natural gas and power marketer and trader, on Monday said third-quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns. While Enron posted a loss, it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business. 
""Energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down,"" said Jon Burnham, portfolio manager for the $170 million Burnham Fund. ""These are good, well-financed companies."" 
Caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes. The Peoria, Illinois-based company on Tuesday said its third-quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing. 
The company also said it expects fourth-quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year-ago quarter, with full-year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent. It blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month's attacks for the expected shortfall, but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels. 
Unisys on Monday reported its third-quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high-end server computers and systems integration work. It said it would cut 3,000 jobs and slashed its fourth-quarter outlook. 
TAKING GRIM TIDINGS IN STRIDE 
Other companies that have reported profit drops include Novellus Systems Inc. , a maker of semiconductor production equipment, and Charles Schwab Corp. , the top U.S. discount brokerage. Schwab said Tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer, although a surge in September trading pointed to better times ahead. 
Money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride. 
""Most of these earnings situations are in these stocks,"" said Burnham. ""Barring unforeseens in the national and international situation, the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months."" 
""Whatever earnings are in this quarter isn't going to matter too much, except in cases where they're considerably better than expected or worse,"" he said. 
This week is the busiest for earnings with 15 Dow Jones industrial average and 180 Standard & Poor's 500 Index companies scheduled to report. 
Profits for the companies in the index are expected to shrink by 22.8 percent, according to market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial, making it the worst quarter since the second quarter of 1991. That's down from an expected 6.2 percent decline at the beginning of the quarter, and a 14.7 percent drop expected on Sept. 10, said First Call analyst Joe Cooper. 
Some 85 S&P 500 companies so far have reported quarterly results. Of these, 50 companies have beaten the most recent, often lowered Wall Street expectations while 26 have matched and nine have missed forecasts.

USA: INTERVIEW-Enron says may partner or sell broadband business.

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy giant Enron Corp. said on Tuesday it is reviewing strategic options for its loss-making broadband telecommunications business, which could involve selling the business or finding a partner. 
""In addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business, we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities,"" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Earlier on Tuesday, Enron reported that one-time charges of $1.01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in more than four years. 
Future options for the broadband business include ""sale, partnership, all kinds of possibilities"" he said. 
""We still think over time that it will be a valuable business,"" Lay said, but for now the broadband market is in a ""total meltdown"", he added. 
Enron's broadband unit, which owns an 18,000 mile network, posted a loss of $80 million for the third quarter, but Lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters. 
Enron launched its broadband business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential and has scaled down its operations. 
Enron's stock rose by 87 percent last year, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured, CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India. 
Enron shares on Tuesday closed up 67 cents, or 2.02 percent, at $33.84.

USA: UPDATE 6-Enron posts loss after taking $1 bln in charges.
By C. Bryson Hull

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. on Tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments, including water and telecommunications services, which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses. 
Enron, North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power, said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company's stock lost two-thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company.
""What we've tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way,"" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in a conference call. 
Lay reassumed the CEO mantle at Enron after his successor, Jeff Skilling, resigned in August after only six months at the helm. 
Houston-based Enron reported a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with net income of $271 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 2000. It was Enron's first loss since the second quarter of 1997. 
The charges covered the company's loss-making broadband telecommunications business, its troubled water affiliate Azurix, and New Power Co., Enron's retail electricity joint-venture with AOL/Time Warner and IBM. 
Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said it would probably take Enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a Wall Street favorite just 12 months ago. 
""They do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting, they're a solid company, but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield,"" said Meade. 
Enron's stock closed 67 cents higher at $33.84 on Tuesday, but for the year it is down about 59 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index .SPU), which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period. 
ILL-FATED BUSINESSES 
Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of U.S. energy markets to become the nation's dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity. 
The company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring Britain's Wessex Water and forming Azurix, a unit which Enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled. 
Enron helped set up New Power Co. and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $28 per share to less than $2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated U.S. residential electricity markets. 
Enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential. 
Enron's stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured, Skilling resigned and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India. 
Enron's third-quarter earnings before one-time charges rose to $393 million, or 43 cents a share, from $292 million, or 34 cents a share, meeting analysts' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
The company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter, $1.80 for all of 2001 and $2.15 for all of 2002. 
DEBT ON CREDIT REVIEW 
Rating agency Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. The writedowns would reduce Enron's equity base, increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings, Moody's said. 
Enron's third-quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division, the company's backbone moneymaker, grew 28 percent. 
The division, which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas, saw pretax income rise to $754 million from $589 million in the third quarter of 2000. 
All of the income growth in the segment came from Enron's gas and power trading and marketing operations in the Americas, where income grew to $701 million from $536 million last year. 
The European segment, which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals, coal and crude oil, remained flat at $53 million amid lower volatility. 
The latest earnings report marked the first time that Enron has provided a financial breakdown of the European and Americas wholesale operations. 
In doing so, Lay delivered on a promise he made after Skilling's departure: that he would make Enron's financial reporting more transparent. Many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from Enron.

Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)

Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)

     (Adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percent
of Enron's profits over the last four quarters. Closes shares.)

     Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, had a $618 million loss in the third quarter after
expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales
cost the company $1.01 billion.

     The loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferred
dividends, Enron said. Net income a year earlier was $292 million,
or 34 cents. Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion.

     Investors have sent Enron stock down 60 percent this year on
concern about investments outside energy trading and natural-gas
pipelines. Some investors praised Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman
and chief executive officer, for acknowledging the failure of the
new businesses. Others said they're not confident all the bad news
is out.

     ``What is disconcerting is that they didn't do this sooner,''
said Donald Coxe, manager of the $352 million Harris Insight
Equity Fund. ``If you kill one cockroach in the kitchen, it
doesn't mean there aren't more.''

     Investors have questioned Enron's financial reporting in the
past year, especially after Jeffrey Skilling's resignation as CEO
in August. Skilling, who helped Lay transform Enron from a gas-
pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading, said
he left for personal reasons. Investors said they weren't
confident Enron was detailing all its problems.

                         Failed Businesses

     The $1.01 billion in losses, which total $1.11 a share, are
equal to 70 percent of Enron's $1.45 billion in profits over the
past four quarters.

     Included were $544 million for losses on investments in New
Power Co., a venture formed with AOL Time Warner Inc. and
International Business Machines Corp. New Power competes for
energy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power and
gas suppliers as they do long-distance phone companies.

     The $544 million also includes losses from the Enron unit
that trades space, known as bandwidth, on fiber-optic networks, as
well as for the ``early termination of certain structured finance
arrangements'' with an undisclosed ``entity.'' Enron wouldn't be
more specific.

     Enron said restructuring the fiber-optic unit would cost
another $180 million, including severance pay to 500 fired
workers. The business collapsed this year along with the fortunes
of the dot-com companies that were expected to be some off its
biggest customers.

     The declining value of assets owned by Azurix Corp., its
water and sewage treatment business, will cost $287 million, Enron
said.

     Enron might take a first-quarter ``adjustment'' of less than
$200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill,
Lay said in an interview. ``If we thought there were any other
significant concerns, we would have taken care of them today,''
Lay said.

                         Excluding Losses

     Minus the losses, Enron would have earned $393 million, or 43
cents a share, up 35 percent from the year-earlier period. That
matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call.

     Enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percent
for the past year. Its wholesale services business, which includes
energy trading, had income before interest, minority interests and
taxes of $754 million, up 28 percent from a year earlier.
     Shares of Enron rose 67 cents to $33.84. Earlier, the stock
had risen as much as 5.2 percent to $34.90.

     ``There's a sigh of relief that Enron's core businesses, its
energy merchant businesses, are OK,'' said Roger Hamilton, who
helps manage John Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares.

     Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the
fourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.

                     `Ridiculous Investments'

     At one time, Enron pinned high hopes on the businesses that
contributed to the $1.01 billion in losses.

     Enron spent $2.8 billion in 1998 for the U.K.'s Wessex Water,
from which Azurix emerged. Enron sold shares to the public in
1999, and then bought back the company this year after Azurix
failed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winning
large projects. In August, Enron agreed to sell Azurix's North
American business to American Water Works Inc. for $150 million.

     In February 2000, Lay said trading bandwidth could become the
company's fastest-growing business. In the latest quarter, the
bandwidth unit's loss before interest, minority interests and
taxes widened to $80 million from $20 million a year earlier.

Revenue plunged to $4 million from $162 million.

     ``You can make the case that Jeff Skilling leaving was for
the best,'' John Hancock's Hamilton said. ``Under him, they built
the best trading operation while also making all these ridiculous
investments.''

     While admitting its poor choices, Enron also supplied more
information this quarter about how it makes money. The company
gave results of individual commodity-trading desks, including
coal, forest products and steel.

     ``I liked that they broke out the different commodities,''
Hamilton said. ``I think Lay has gotten the message loud and
clear, and that the effort is there.''

"Re: ENTEX","A summary of AA's final audit results was never delivered to me, Brenda and Bob (I have added Brenda and Bob to the distribution) were handling the AA audit team and I have never seen a compilation of the items we agreed to in our last meeting with AA just before the HPL sale negotiations started.  This does not mean Bob or Brenda may not have the information but I have never seen it.  (Confidentially, I think AA was struggling with their role in this because Entex/Reliant is such a large customer of theirs)  In our last meeting we agreed to use the audit issues as leverage to clarify the intent of the contract.  Who were the other suppliers, how were they allocated, clear definition of which citygates HPL served off-system and access to balancing information on a real time basis for planning purposes.  A better understanding of Entex's transportation agreement on Midcon and a more proactive role in the management of the transportation contract  Or, if we could not get some of this information and cooperation, HPL would reduce its role with Entex to deliveries at HPL's sales point (basically out of HPL's asset) into Midcon, etc.

Clarification of contract issues will help HPL identify those Entex markets we can consider incremental on other pipelines (currently Entex/Midcon claims some Midcon citygates are outside the 10 bcf commitment and additive to Midcon's supply contract with Entex (part of HPL's audit issues is that there is no definitive agreement on which ones).  Indentification has the affect of determining those Entex markets HPL should spend their capital on because theoretically we have the other markets via the transportation agreement.

Other issues revolve around Entex's allocation proceedure for R/C and industrial gas users.  As you all know, there is a significant difference in price between the two.  Entex's allocation proceedure needs to be clearly documented and supported.  HPL is in the unusual position of having its customer (Entex) determine the allocation and whether or not the customer (Entex) has met all its obligations, naturally, the customer rarely falls short of its contractual requirements with this process.

Any monies recovered in this process belong to the desk, it was their performance risk, storage revenue, P/L etc that was at risk during the contract year.  Additionally, a new audit period for the last contract year will be at the end of this month.  If Enron is going to pursue this, it would be appropriate to contact Entex for preperation for an additional audit.  I suggest we avoid the AA conflict (we should have enough work papers etc. to support the effort) and go with one of the other large audit firms who has no alliance to Reliant or Entex.

Team:

I met with Brad Blevins and Jim Ducote today regarding credits and obligations (implied, documented or otherwise) between Entex, ENA and HPL.  We need to pull the above group together to get a consistent view on:

1.	The definition and transfer of ENA obligations to Entex and reserves against those obligations to HPL/AEP.

2.	The creation of an A/R invoice to Entex for payment based on the definitive results of the audit.

Brad/Jim:  can you email the note you gave me today to the above group.

Tom/Ed:  can you pull together a summary of the results of the audit showing what Entex owes HPL and what Entex owes ENA.

Lillian: can you arrange a meeting with the above group to discuss.

Thanks,
Brian

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Subject:	RE: how did your meeting w/ the lawyers go?

Hunter, the meeting went well. We met with Bryan Murtagh (UBS attorney) and did an overview of the contract services we are looking to set up with the pipes, how those are utilized and some of the underlying risks/exposure of using these contracts. Basically the message was these are non-negotiable contracts, he seemed to understand that and didn't indicate this would require any major legal review from their side. We also had a discussion about the credit requirements and what some of the pipes are asking for. Follow up credit meeting to take place today to get into some greater detail and get a standard credit package together. Also UBS did indicate that they also want to do a credit review of the pipes before moving forward. To faciltiate that we gave them a list of the Day 1 pipes to start their process.

In summary, I don't believe there will be any challenge on us entering into these agreements nor a lenghty review by the UBS attorneys. The credit issue is big, need to have them expedite their review of pipelines and also recognize our need to satisfy the pipeline credit requirments for a new customer (standard credit package and any addtional requirements). Also need some defintitive answers on when we can actually send this information out (is it now or is it when the deal closes). Suzanne is going to a legal meeting this AM to discuss/recap where everything is at this point in time. I will forward any additonal information to you when I get it. This assumes the Power of Attorney issue will be settled shortly for contract execution.

Bob

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

To all:

Be aware that there is a scheduled outage at NNG MOPS interconnect for June 1-6.  All producers will be shut-in to permanently repair a leak that was detected and temporarily patched.  Gas will NOT be allowed to flow to FGT, Koch or HPL.  All producers will be shut in to zero.

This typically affects deals we do with ERT and Taylor Energy.

Any questions, let me know.

Sabra

Jeanie,

Can you send me Jim's evaluation form so I can write his midyear review?  John was out today so I did not get to ask about feedback on Jim.

"Online Trading Simulation Feb 7th","Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

"RE: ESOP rollover into Savings Plan","Tom,

Got your voicemail and e-mail.  Below is the explanation I received from Corp Benefits on the price for your recent activity through Hewitt.  Will get back with you on final resolution to this problem before the end of the week. Hopefully will have an answer for you by  Thursday, no later than Friday. 

Thanks again for your patience.

Response:
Irma,

I've just verified the following information from Hewitt:

On Tuesday, 11/20/01, Mr. Martin spoke with a rep at Hewitt to roll over his ESOP balance into the Savings Plan.  He made this request at 4:28 p.m.  Since this was after the market close (which was 3:00 p.m.), his transaction did not occur until the 11/21/01 update.  He rolled 1,522.00 shares over to the Savings Plan, at a total value of $7,625.22, which is $5.01 per share.  That value was posted to the Enron Corp. stock fund in the Savings Plan the evening of 11/21/01.  They were in his Savings Plan account as of the morning of 11/22/01 (which was Thanksgiving Day).  
On 11/23/01, Mr. Martin transferred his holdings in the Enron Corp. Stock Fund to the Stable Asset fund.  He did this transfer at 2:22 p.m., via the web site.  However, on 11/23/01, the stock exchange closed at 1:00 p.m., instead of the usual 3:00 p.m.  Consequently, the transfer was not effective on Friday, 11/23/01, but occurred on the next business day, which was 11/26/01.  At the time of the transfer, the value in the Stock Fund was $6,113.26, which was equal to $4.01 per share.

Thanks again for your patience and cooperation.

Subject:	ESOP rollover into Savings Plan

I left you a voicemail as well.  I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it appears the ESOP rollover into Savings Plan ocurred as we discussed last week.  I got into the Savings Plan on Friday 11/23 and moved the Enron shares to Stable Assets also as we discussed.  It appears that the price used was Monday's close of $4.01 instead of Friday's close of $4.71.

So where do we go from here?  I am assuming per our previous meeting that whether $4.01 or $4.71 is used; that one of these prices will be used to keep me whole versus a price sometime in September (probably September 30th) when the ESOP shares should have been put into the Savings Plan.

Please call me at you earliest convenience to resolve this.

Thanks,

Tom

"ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION//////CONFIDENTIAL and Privileged","Article II of the NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT entered in connection with the sale of HPL to AEP (which closed as of June 1,2001) provides:

	""ENA [for 3 months post-close] will not  solicit, negotiate or enter into any contract, agreement or arrangement for the purchase of natural gas on the HPL Pipeline from any Person which is a supplier or producer of natural gas connected to the HPL Facilities; provided, however, nothing herein shall be construed or interpreted as prohibiting ENA from entering into any such contract, agreement or arrangement which is less than one month in duration and involves or is related to an Enron Online transaction."" 

 This is not the most clearly drafted provision as it was the subject of much negotiation....and was significantly narrowed from the  original scope proposed by AEP.  Thus, please consult with me prior to entering into any solicitation, agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months.  There are many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus, it behoves us to carefully weigh the risks and rewards of ""stepping too close to or over the line"".

Further,although a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only applies to ENA, no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian Redmond and me.

Please communicate this restriction to those who report to you and have need to be aware of this limited restriction.

Sincerely

UK: UK Coalpower keen for 500MW station at Hatfield.

10/12/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Coalpower, the company set up by former RJB Mining chief Richard Budge, says it would like to build a coal-fired power station near its newly acquired Hatfield colliery in South Yorkshire, northern England. 
""We are keen to build a 500 megawatt clean coal power plant and are talking to various people"", Budge told Reuters on Thursday, adding the chances of such a station coming to fruition would be closely linked to the outcome of Britain's current review of its energy needs to 2050.
""Let's see what comes out of the energy review - if it's positive for coal gasification it will not just be our plant that will be built, others will be."" 
Coalpower acquired the Hatfield coal mine on Monday, beating off competition from U.S. energy group Enron and UK Coal (formerly RJB Mining) and is spending about five million pounds ($8.4 million) to restart production. 
Budge said Hatfield has the potential to become a long-life pit with its 100 million tonnes of contiguous coal reserves and he is looking for output in excess of 500,000 tonnes a year. 
""Hatfield is the optimum site for a coal gasification combined cycle plant"", said Budge, adding Britain needed coal generation to maintain a balanced and diverse energy portfolio. 
The government has said it is concerned about Britain's projected dependence on imported natural gas. 
Conventional coal burning power stations are high in fossil fuel emissions, which many scientists believe contribute to global warming. But gasification combined cycle technology converts coal to a gaseous fuel from which most of the impurities are removed prior to combustion. 
Supporters of coal say the clean coal technology can address many of the environmental concerns of burning coal. 
Coal mining in Britain has been in decline for decades, but the fuel still accounts for about a third of its power generation and recent signs point to the industry enjoying a mini revival. 
A doubling in the price of British natural gas over the last year has led to a rise in coal demand as electricity generators seek out the cheapest fuel in a highly competitive market. The increased demand for coal has propelled prices to about 35 pounds a tonne compared with 22.50 #18 months ago.

Enron's Azurix faces damages claim if rescinds Buenos Aires water contract

BUENOS AIRES (AFX) - Enron Corp water and sewage unit Azurix Buenos Aires SA faces a claim for compensation unless it reverses plans to rescind its concession to provide the province's water and sewage services, financial daily Buenos Aires Economico reported. 
The damages claim would be filed by public prosecutor Ricardo Szelagowski, the newspaper cited provincial secretary for public services, Eduardo Sicaro, as saying.
Azurix said earlier this week it will rescind the concession on Jan 2, but continue operating the service ""until the provincial authorities, or the operator it designates, take charge of assets and operations"".

Enron backs away from Coburg plant

10/12/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

COBURG, Ore. (AP) - Enron will not be a partner in a proposed natural gas power plant here, the project's managing director said Thursday. 
But Gary Marcus, who owns Coburg Power, said losing the Texas-based conglomerate will not stop the project.
""Enron never drove this deal,"" he said. ""I invited Enron into the deal."" 
Marcus said Enron's participation improved the quality of the plant's design but slowed the decision-making process. Marcus predicted he will find a new backer in less than six months and will have a license to build the project within a year. 
Enron backed out because the project did not meet its market strategy, Marcus said. 
Enron officials couldn't be reached for comment. 
Enron's departure will do little to appease local residents, who fear that the power plant will harm ground water and air quality. 
""I don't think it'll ever be built,"" said Kent Johnston of Coburg, a project opponent. ""If the people of Coburg and Eugene have anything to say about it, it won't be."" 
Added Joey Gayles, a committee chairman in the residents' opposition group, ""We're going to fight (Marcus) tooth and nail."" 
The proposed 40-acre site north of Coburg meets all criteria for construction of a 300-megawatt plant on 12 acres of the site, Marcus said. The remainder of the site would be used for buffer area and wetlands mitigation. 
An additional eight acres will be required for the 600-megawatt plant that Coburg Power wants to build, he said. The larger plant would require additional permits that might delay the project. 
Expanding the existing natural gas pipeline that runs under the site also would add to the plant's cost. The larger plant would generate the equivalent of all power currently consumed in Lane County. 
Marcus estimated the cost of the larger plant at $300 million to $400 million. The smaller plant would cost about $180 million, he said.

UK Crt Blocks Challenge To Intl Arbitration In Enron Spat

10/12/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

BOMBAY (AP)--A Commercial Court in London has restrained an Indian state government from blocking international arbitration proceedings by the U.S. power giant Enron to recover claims of up to $5 billion, a company statement said Friday. 
""The injunction facilitates a timely and impartial review by the international arbitration panel of the dispute between the Dabhol Power Company and the Maharashtra state government,"" said the statement issued in Bombay, India's financial capital.
Wednesday's court injunction in London is expected to block the state government's move to settle the dispute in India through the state-owned Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission. 
Enron said the original contract for the disputed Dabhol power project required international arbitration. The company accused the state government of using a delaying tactic by trying to halt the international arbitration in favor of a settlement procedure in India. 
Enron has a 65% stake in the Dabhol Power Co. Its 2,184-megawatt power project is India's biggest foreign investment. In phase one of the project, Enron supplied electricity from naphtha for its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which has said it can't afford the prices negotiated seven years ago. 
The contract included a federal government guarantee to cover any nonpayment. Enron has said guarantee hasn't been met, despite two notices to the federal government. 
The second part of the project, more than 90% complete, involves building a new plant to produce electricity from liquefied natural gas, and a container ship port to import it. 
Houston-based Enron says it has halted construction for the second phase and it was costing hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Enron wants to pull out of India and recover its entire investment and that of its partners, General Electric and Bechtel Corp.

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- The Commercial Court of London has restrained India's Maharashtra state government from filing a suit in India challenging the international arbitration proceedings initiated by Dabhol Power Co., reports the Hindu Business Line. 
Dabhol Power is an Indian unit of U.S.-based energy company Enron Corp. (ENE).
The newspaper says Dabhol obtained the court order Thursday, and the state government has 23 days to respond. 
Dabhol is locked in a long-standing payment dispute with its sole buyer, Maharashtra State Electricity Board. 
Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power project located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. Enron holds a controlling 65% stake in Dabhol. Costing $2.9 billion, the project is the single largest foreign investment in India to date. Newspaper Web site: www.thehindubusinessline.com

India: Enron may seek $30 m to exit Greenfield

10/12/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)

NEW DELHI, Oct. 11 ENRON is looking at a price of about $30 million for exiting from Greenfield Shipping Company, in which one of its affiliates, Atlantic Commercial Inc, is a 20 per cent equity partner. 
While Enron's 20 per cent stake in the $220-million LNG venture for Dabhol Power Company comes to $11 million, the Houston-based company is understood to have put up a price of $30 million for exiting from Greenfield, bankers familiar with the developments told Business Line.
The $30 million price pegged by Enron for its 20 per cent stake comprises $11 million for equity and $19 million for swapping the company's share of the loan liabilities, the sources said. 
Though Atlantic Commercial Inc is yet to make an official statement on pulling out of the LNG shipping deal, it is understood to have conveyed to the project lenders led by ANZ Investment Bank that such a decision was imminent in view of Enron's plan to exit from Dabhol Power Company. 
The State-run Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) is a 20 per cent partner in Greenfield, while the remaining 60 per cent equity in the joint venture consortium is held by Japan's Mitsui O.S.K.Lines. 
In view of the controversy surrounding the power plant, the lenders to the LNG shipping deal have declared an event of default and suspended the last tranche of the project loan worth $55 million. The ANZ Investment Bank-led consortium has already pumped in $110 million out of a total loan commitment of $165 million for the 137,000 cubic metre capacity tanker being build at Mitsubishi's yard in Japan. 
The three promoters will now have to put in additional investments to the tune of $55 million to take possession of the vessel on the scheduled delivery date of November 15. 
The board of SCI has not been able to come to a conclusion on putting in extra funds in the project despite discussing the issue several times. A board meet held on Tuesday to discuss the issue again ended in stalemate, Government sources said. 
SCI's dilemma on making extra investments in the project also centre around the fate of Enron's equity in the deal. In the event of Enron pulling out of the LNG shipping project, its 20 per cent equity would have to be taken over by the two remaining partners. Besides, these two partners would also have to pool-in the additional investments of $55 million amongst themselves in proportion to their revised equity holdings. 
""However, there is a great question mark over whether Mitsui and SCI should agree to take over the equity of Enron"", the sources said. 
During discussions held in London recently, Mitsui had clearly told the lenders that it was not in favour of putting in extra funds to salvage the LNG shipping deal. 
Moreover, with the consortium now looking at a charter hire rate of $60,000 to $65,000 per day as against the rate of $98,600 per day agreed with Dabhol Power Company, both SCI and Mitsui feels that the revised charter hire rates would render their investments unviable. 
According to estimates, at a charter hire rate of $60,000 per day, Greenfield is expected to earn about $22 million per annum. Out of this, $4-$5 million will be spent on operating expenses of the tanker. 
The remaining $17-18 million will fetch an internal rate of return (IRR) of 7-8 per cent for Mitsui at an equity stake of 60 per cent. 
""Mitsui feels that an IRR of this level was not sufficient for their investments"", the sources said. 
Whereas, for SCI, the investments would fetch a return of 4-4.5 per cent. ""This will be far below the Government norm of 12 per cent IRR for projects involving State-funding,"" the sources said.

India: Dabhol gets restraint order from UK court

MUMBAI, Oct. 11 THE Commercial Court of London has given an ex parte order restraining the Maharashtra Government from filing a suit in India challenging the international arbitration proceedings initiated by Dabhol Power Company (DPC). 
The Enron-promoted DPC obtained the order today and the State has 23 days to respond. Maharashtra has been restrained from ""commencing or prosecuting or continuing or taking any steps in or otherwise participating in proceedings in any court or tribunal in India in restraint of or otherwise relating to the three arbitrations"", the order said. The three arbitrations relate to State guarantees to the project.
A DPC spokesman said now ""the arbitration process in London would continue as originally contemplated and agreed by the State Government and DPC. This has no bearing on the on-going proceedings involving DPC, MSEB and MERC before the Mumbai High Court and Supreme Court"". 
He also said Maharashtra is not a party to any of the on-going proceedings before the Mumbai High Court and the Supreme Court. ""Over the past few months, the State Government and other Government entities have taken actions to avoid complying with their contractual obligations. 
This has frustrated the rights of international investors that were legally agreed to by the relevant parties several years ago. The injunction facilitates the timely and impartial review by the international arbitration panel of the dispute between DPC and the State,"" the company said. 
The arbitration panel had been constituted sometime ago and proceedings were expected to begin any time. 
However, the proceedings could not take off as a dispute over the jurisdiction of the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission had dragged on to the Mumbai High Court and then the Supreme Court. 
Both courts had restrained DPC from continuing international arbitration pending resolution of the MERC jurisdiction issue. The State Government was expected to file a civil suit in the Mumbai High Court accusing the company of fraud and misrepresentation. Internal differences in the Government and the legal team over proving ""fraud"" had led to the resignation of the State counsel.

USA: Sempra's fiber/natgas technology could begin in Dec.

10/11/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 11 (Reuters) - A Sempra Energy unit said on Thursday its new system for running fiber-optic cable through natural gas pipelines, in turn leaving city streets intact, could begin commercial service in December. 
Putting fiber-optic lines in existing natural gas pipelines - which already have cleared rights-of-way - could tackle the telecommunications industry's ""last mile"" problem of connecting end users to outlying fiber-optic cable networks without tearing up roadways.
A surge in demand for high-speed Internet access has led telecommunications companies to pour billions of dollars into vast nationwide fiber-optic systems that carry data to computers, phones and screens faster than traditional copper wires. 
Sempra Fiber Links, a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy, made the announcement after its first installation of the technology in the gas distribution system of Frontier Energy, a Sempra Energy unit in North Carolina. 
Sempra's technology involves encasing fiber-optic cable in a protective polyethylene conduit before inserting it through the same local gas lines serving utility customers. 
The company said installing the cable would not prevent a utility from servicing its gas lines or keeping them safe. 
Jennifer Andrews, a Sempra Fiber Links spokeswoman, said the company was discussing its fiber-in-gas system with gas utilities throughout the United States. 
SAVINGS 
Andrews said companies using the technology could save from 30 percent to 50 percent on last mile costs compared with traditional trenching and installation methods. 
Sempra Energy unit Southern California Gas Co., one of the largest gas utilities in the U.S. with about 18 million customers, plans to use fiber-in-gas technology in its system as soon as it is approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. 
Energy companies that have ventured into the fiber-optic business by building infrastructure and/or through bandwidth trade, include Williams Cos ., El Paso Corp. ., Enron Corp. , Dynegy Inc. , Duke Energy , Consolidated Edison Inc. and Montana Power Co. . 
In March 2000, Montana Power announced plans to divest its energy business and invest the proceeds into its broadband and telecommunications unit Touch America.

Tauzin/Enron -2: Skilling To Testify Thursday

02/06/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.) said he expects former Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling will testify before Tauzin's committee Thursday. 
Tauzin said the committee will ask what Skilling's reaction was to the internal report that Enron's financial deals ""were very suspicious"" and why Skilling apparently tried to stifle those reports by reassiginig the official responsible for the reports.
""We'd love to hear his take on that,"" Tauzin said. 
Tauzin said he will ask why Skilling ignored repeated requests to sign so-called approval sheets for questionable mergers. Tauzin also told reporters there is no need to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Enron. 
""We are going to do our job,"" Tauzin said Wednesday in a brief interview with reporters covering a telecommunications conference in Washington. 
""We don't need a special prosecutor,"" Tauzin said. 
Tauzin is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Labor Secy. to Address Enron Hearings
Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to Speak to Congressional Panel on Post-Enron Efforts

The Associated Press
Feb. 6 
WASHINGTON (AP) The subpoenas are multiplying, the hearings mushrooming in Congress' investigation into the collapse of Enron Corp., a once powerful company transformed into a symbol of American corporate failure.
""The thought of employees sustaining huge losses while executives were able to sell stock for millions is infuriating,"" Sen. Joseph Lieberman said Tuesday. He announced he plans to issue a subpoena to get information about bonuses paid to company executives in the run-up to its Dec. 2 bankruptcy.
Lieberman spoke after a laid-off worker tearfully described losing $40,000 from her retirement account last fall as Enron slid toward collapse.
The hearings were picking up again Wednesday, with one committee hearing from Labor Secretary Elaine Chao about Bush administration plans to strengthen retirement account protections for millions of workers. Two other panels were to be active as well.
On Tuesday, Joseph Berardino, chairman of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, drew the wrath of House members over Anderson's handling of Enron and the shredding of documents.
""You have squandered the integrity of your company,"" Rep. Gary Ackerman, D-N.Y., told him.
Berardino's response to the criticism: ""At the end of the day, we do not cause companies to fail.""
As no less than four congressional panels met on the Enron debacle, the Senate Commerce Committee approved a subpoena for Kenneth Lay, the former head of Enron who canceled plans to appear voluntarily Monday. ""We have no choice,"" said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
Rep. Michael Oxley, head of the House banking committee, signed a subpoena for Lay to appear before his panel on Feb. 14, two days after the Senate appearance.
Lay's attorney Earl Silbert dismissed any suggestion that Lay was ""making himself scarce"" to avoid investigators.
Lawmakers predicted Lay would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he appears.
A dozen committees are investigating Enron, along with the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission. The energy-trading company has deep political ties in Washington, and politicians in both parties have scrambled to distance themselves from Enron.
The Justice Department has rejected calls by some Democrats for a special prosecutor.
""This is a business problem that our Justice Department is going to investigate, and if there's wrongdoing we'll hold them accountable for mistreatment of employees and shareholders,"" President Bush said Tuesday.
Millions of investors lost money, and thousands of current and former Enron employees lost the great bulk of their retirement savings, when the company collapsed. An Enron-sponsored investigation released over the weekend blamed senior management for failing to provide proper supervision over a complex web of partnerships that helped the company hide debt and post unrealistic profit figures.
Once disclosed, the transactions contributed to the company's unraveling
The biggest fireworks Tuesday were reserved for Berardino.
Oxley noted that the Enron internal investigation found active participation by Andersen in setting up the partnerships, and that the accounting firm had received $5.7 million for advice on the subject.
""You weren't just checking the boxes,"" he told Berardino, who claimed he wasn't in the loop, and Andersen's auditors didn't actively participate in setting up the partnerships.
""I did not do the audit of the company,"" he said. ""Information was withheld from us.""
Lead Enron auditor David Duncan was fired in January, accused by his employer of organizing the destruction of Enron documents.
The committee also heard testimony about a period of roughly three weeks last fall when individuals were barred from selling any stock in their retirement accounts, a lockout attributed to a change in plan administrators.
Because the price of Enron stock was dropping at the time, officials debated whether to postpone the lockout, but eventually decided not to. The company found ""it was not feasible to notify more than 20,000 participants in a timely fashion,"" said Cindy Olson, Enron's executive vice president for human resources.
Enron's stock peaked at $82 a share on Jan. 26, 2001. It was selling for $15.40 at the close of trading on Oct. 26, the day the lockout began, and had fallen to $9.98 on Nov. 13, the day it ended.
At another hearing, the author of the withering Enron internal investigation described how the executives ""enriched themselves ... by tens of millions of dollars"" through questionable partnerships.

Enron Knew in March That Partnerships Caused Losses
2002-02-05 16:22 (New York)

     Washington, Feb. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. knew in March that its affiliated partnerships were causing losses and made the problem worse by continuing to give stock to them, the law professor appointed to investigate the company told Congress.
     William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School, said Enron was facing a $500 million loss in March. Rather than report it to shareholders, he told the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Enron in March gave a partnership called Raptor another $800 million in Enron shares.
     ""Enron compounded the problem,'' Powers said. ""There's no question that virtually everyone, from the board of directors on down, understood that the company was seeking to offset its investment losses with its own stock.''
     The partnerships allowed Houston-based Enron to inflate earnings from the third quarter of 2000 until the third quarter of 2001 by $1 billion, Powers said.
     ""More than 70 percent of their earnings for that 15-month period were false,'' Powers told the panel.
     Powers was appointed as an Enron director in November to lead an investigation at the board's request. He told the committee he expects to leave the board.
     Enron filed the largest U.S. bankruptcy protection petition Dec. 2. Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice are investigating.

Lay's Responsibility

     Former Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay is responsible for knowing the partnerships would could cause the company he helped form in 1985 to collapse, Powers said.
     ""Ken Lay isn't the Luke Skywalker here,'' Powers said, referring to the partnership names taken from the Star Wars movies in which Skywalker was the hero. ""There were red flags that should've indicated to him what was happening. It's absolutely true Lay understood they were using their own stock to offset the losses in the partnerships.''
     The Senate Commerce Committee voted today to subpoena Lay after he canceled an appearance scheduled for yesterday. The House Financial Services Committee voted yesterday to subpoena him. Enron's collapse is being investigated by at least 10 congressional committees.
     Lay, who resigned from Enron's board yesterday, cited comments by lawmakers about the Powers report as the reason he canceled his testimony.
     ""These inflammatory statements show that judgments have been reached and the tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial,'' Lay's attorney, Earl J. Silbert, said in a letter to the Senate Commerce Committee.
     Tauzin, who said on television Sunday that he thought Enron executives likely broke the law, said at today's hearing that investigations by Congress, the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission should have indicated to Lay that he faced legal troubles.
     ""If that wasn't enough to warn you and your lawyers that you had real problems, then get yourself some new lawyers,'' he said.

Threatened Bonuses

     Investigators for the Energy and Commerce Committee found evidence some Enron employees had their salaries paid by the company and their bonuses paid by the special purpose entities, or partnerships, in question.
     ""There's a lot of self-dealing here,'' said Representative Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican and chairman of the committee, told reporters after the hearing. ""There were actual signals sent that there were bonuses threatened'' if employees didn't participate in questionable actions.
     In his testimony to the committee, Powers said Enron misrepresented the financial condition of the company to shareholders because it wanted to hide involvement with and liability to special purpose entities such as Chewco LJM1 and LJM2. Former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow should have disclosed more to his superiors, he said.
     ""Fastow should've come forward and disclosed he was self-dealing with partnerships on a much larger scale than he had told before,'' Powers said. ""A CFO should be responsible for the financial aspects of the company. Fastow couldn't mind the store because he was involved in the transactions.''
     ""Mr. Fastow seems to be the Betty Crocker of cooked books,'' said Representative James Greenwood, a Pennsylvania Republican.
     Fastow, who was fired on Oct. 24, made $30 million in two years from managing and investing in the LJM partnerships, an Enron filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission says.
     Fastow and former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling are scheduled to testify before House and Senate panels Thursday.

House Panel Hears Enron's Powers Before Exec Testimonies
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

02/06/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This article was originally published Tuesday.) 

By Bryan Lee
WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) board member who spearheaded an internal investigation told a House investigating panel Tuesday that key company executives should have been aware of liabilities with the company's off-the-balance-sheet partnerships, but he declined to assert that investors had been defrauded. 
William Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school, told the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations panel that top executives should have known that transactions with the partnerships were designed to hide billions in losses from public scrutiny. 
Key Enron executives involved in the partnerships ""were definitely using Enron assets to enrich themselves,"" Powers testified. 
But he repeatedly declined to describe their actions as fraud, despite several attempts by lawmakers. 
""I'm not in a position...to say,"" Powers told Rep. Peter Deutsch, D-Fla., when he asked if shareholders were defrauded. 
When Deutsch pressed him for an answer, Powers replied that he wasn't in a position to determine the ""state of mind"" of the Enron officials involved in the partnership dealings. 
But Powers told Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., the committee's chairman, that there were no other discernible purposes of the partnerships except to hide the company's debt and enrich key senior Enron officers. 
""What we really have here is a case of inside theft,"" Tauzin said. 
Powers painted a highly critical picture of the roles played by former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay; former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling; former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow; former managing director of an Enron unit, Michael Kopper; Chief Accounting and Information Officer Richard Causey; and Chief Risk Officer Richard Buy. 
Many of those implicated by Powers are slated to testify before the committee Thursday. 
Powers, in an apparent reference to Lay, said Enron ""management"" didn't take ""seriously enough"" the concerns of Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, who sent Lay a memo last August warning that Enron would ""implode in a wave of accounting scandals."" 
And Kopper, who reported to Fastow, entered into a deal that turned a minimum investment into a $10 million windfall ""surreptitiously,"" without approval of Enron's board, Powers said. 
Skilling, whose surprise resignation last August spurred the Watkins memo, was aware of Kopper's involvement, Powers said. Skilling may have verbally approved the investment, but he didn't formally sign off on it, he said. 
Causey, Buy and Skilling were supposed to review Fastow's involvement in the partnerships and approve them as arms-length transactions, rather than sweetheart deals, Powers said. ""The controls were not followed,"" he said. 
""Mr. Fastow wasn't in a position to mind the store, because he was personally involved in these transactions,"" Powers said, noting Fastow received ""very substantial income from these investments"" of at least $30 million. 
""Mr. Fastow appears to be the Betty Crocker of cooked books,"" said Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa., chairman of the committee's Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. 
After former Enron treasurer, Jeffrey McMahon - now the company's president - complained to Skilling about Fastow and the partnership dealings, Skilling transferred McMahon to another job, Powers said. Skilling ""didn't do anything about very accurate concerns,"" he said. 
Powers also said Skilling attended an Enron board meeting where the ""Raptor"" partnerships were approved. Powers described the Raptor partnerships as engaging in sham investment risk-hedging transactions tied to the company's stock, which contributed to the company's financial undoing. 
Tauzin noted that Enron lawyer Jordan Mintz sent Skilling a memo three times encouraging Skilling to formally sign off on the Raptor transactions, but he never did. 
""He should have signed it. It was his responsibility to sign it. He didn't sign it and he didn't explain why he didn't sign it,"" Powers said. 
""I think Mr. Skilling knew a great deal about these transactions and how losses were being hedged with Enron's own stock,"" Powers said. ""At a minimum, he wasn't attending to his own company,"" he said, adding that, in interviews, Skilling said he knew little of the Raptor transactions. 
Causey, the chief accounting officer, ""knew a lot"" about the transactions, Powers said. 
Rep. Christopher John, D-La., said that Causey backdated a document related to the Raptor stock swaps to hide Enron losses. ""Is that fraud?"" he asked. 
""Backdating is extremely serious,"" Powers said, once again declining to characterize actions as defrauding investors. ""We found very compelling evidence that documents were backdated,"" he said. 
Tauzin, the committee chairman, described the Powers report as setting the stage for Thursday's hearing, which he said will detail how ""sweetheart deals"" were put together, and how employees were threatened with firings and loss of bonuses. 
""Your report tracks what our investigators have learned,"" Tauzin told Powers, describing the report's contents as painting a picture of ""insider theft."" 
The partnerships were clearly framed to hide Enron's true financial situation, Tauzin said. The executives involved benefited twice, first from inflating the value of Enron stock they owned, and then again by ""sucking money out of the partnerships,"" he said. 
""How can anyone conclude that the FBI doesn't need to be over there with a set of handcuffs?"" Tauzin asked rhetorically. 
Greenwood, the subcommittee chairman, described the Powers report and his testimony Tuesday as laying the ""factual backdrop"" for future hearings with officials from Enron and the company's outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLC (X.AND). 
""We've discovered that, while thousands of hard-working employees suffered terribly, there was a small group at the top who carted away millions from these very deals that ultimately led to Enron's collapse,"" Greenwood said.

Enron: The Probe Widens: Portrait of An Insider
Fastow emerges as key player: Ran side partnerships: Ex-CFO to appear before committee tomorrow

His salary at Enron Corp. was just over US$500,000 in 2000, a paltry sum beside the US$30-million he is alleged to have made on the side. 
Now, the former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, is increasingly seen as a prime target in the Enron fiasco, as the creator of those complicated LJM partnerships that are said to have hidden at least US$1-billion in losses and triggered the widespread criticism of the energy trader's accounting methods.
That he was closely involved in LJM is beyond doubt; indeed, the acronym represents the first letters of the names of Mr. Fastow's wife and two sons. 
In recent days, the 40-year-old Mr. Fastow has been in talks with U.S. Justice Department officials about obtaining immunity in exchange for testimony. He is scheduled to appear tomorrow before the House energy and commerce committee. 
If a deal is not reached, Mr. Fastow is expected to invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. 
His lawyers say the partnerships, which Mr. Fastow ran and had stakes in, were approved by top management and the board. They say accounting was the responsibility of others. 
Mr. Fastow bore many of the traits of the Enron environment itself -- cocky, aggressive, ambitious. 
Those characteristics were integral to selling deals to banks and institutional investors. Whether by veiled threat or sweet talk, Mr. Fastow got the deal done. ""He had a dual personality. He could be charming but he could also be irrationally mean,"" one insider told Business Week. 
The partnerships Mr. Fastow and other executives are accused of having set up are said to have paid them millions of dollars while concealing losses from Enron shareholders. 
That's the thrust of the report from a special committee of the board of directors of Enron. ""What he presented as an arrangement intended to benefit Enron, became, over time, a means of enriching himself personally and facilitating manipulation of Enron's financial statements,"" concluded the committee, chaired by William C. Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school. It maintains there were at least 13 transactions with Mr. Fastow's partnerships in which employees negotiating for Enron reported to the CFO. 
At the same time, Ken Lay, the former Enron chairman, and Jeffrey Skilling, the former chief executive, are partially absolved because they are said not to have know the extent of Mr. Fastow's dealings. 
""It seems to point the finger at his group of rogue financing and accounting types,"" says John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris Inc. in Houston. ""Enron gamed the system -- it gamed Wall Street, it gamed the lawyers, it gamed the auditing business -- but within the firm, you had a collection of people who were gaming Enron."" 
Mr. Fastow and another senior executive, Michael Kopper, who made at least US$10-million, both refused to be interviewed by the committee. 
Insiders says it was Mr. Fastow's desire to rise in Enron and to please Mr. Skilling that was his downfall. 
He hired the same architect as Mr. Skilling to build his new home in the exclusive River Oaks section of Houston. But it was his aggressive tactics that most pleased Mr. Skilling, who wanted Enron to be a fast-growth, technology-oriented trading company.

Enron DIP Financing Continues Sliding Downhill
By Kathy Chu

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) interim financing package continues to slide downhill.
The loan, which was first projected at $1.5 billion, is now expected to be between $250 million to $500 million, according to people familiar with the matter. This debtor-in-possession-financing, or DIP, is supposed to prop up the bankrupt company as it struggles to reorganize. 
But in recent days, lead bankers J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have been hard-pressed to syndicate the loan, as other banks - some grappling with their own exposure to Enron - are reluctant to take on any new Enron financing, according to sources. 
Tuesday, Enron postponed for the fifth time a hearing to consider the final terms of the loan. Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, is now expected to consider terms of the deal March 6. 
Under the original agreement, the DIP was conditional on syndication of the financing - which reduces the risks to J.P. Morgan and Citigroup - and the repayment of $550 million in credit extended to Enron by the two financial institutions in November. 
The first DIP installment of $250 million was made available to Enron in early December, but the company has yet to tap the loan. 
""We're not in need of the cash, but it's useful to have a credit facility lined up,"" said Martin Bienenstock, with Weil Gotshal & Manges law firm, which represents Enron. ""We have assets worth billions."" 
Bienenstock said DIP lenders are ""basically recasting the whole loan"" in light of the company's stronger-than-expected cash position. 
In late January, Bienenstock had estimated that Enron had about $1 billion in cash. No updated figure is available, the lawyer said Tuesday. 
Enron also has the promise of an additional cash infusion in the near future. The company is in talks to sell its Wessex Water utility in southwest England, one of its largest international assets. This deal could bring in up to $1.2 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
The close of a sale of Enron's energy-trading business to UBS Warburg is also pending. Under the deal, Enron won't get any cash upfront, but will share in future profits. 
""DIP financing is expensive, so they don't want to sign up for anything they don't need,"" said a person familiar with the financing. 
The interim loan carries an interest of 350 basis points, or 3.5 percentage points, over the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR. 
The DIP is senior to all loans under the bankruptcy code, giving financial institutions some incentive to extend the loan to a distressed company.

Enron's broadband unit owes back taxes

02/06/2002

Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Broadband Services, one of Enron Corp.'s failed business ventures, owes Harris County and other entities about $440,000 in back taxes, according to county officials. 
Enron Broadband Services was an unsuccessful Internet venture that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 26. It did not notify the county in 2001 that it had nearly $15 million in telecommunications equipment, county Tax Assessor Paul Bettencourt told the Houston Chronicle in Wednesday's editions.
The company neglected to list the equipment in its 2001 taxable property, Bettencourt said. The taxes were due by Jan. 31, 2002. 
Back tax owed to the county tax office is $207,000. About $237,000 is owed to Houston Independent School District, Bettencourt said. 
County records show the company's property tax was $3,600 for 2001. Records indicate that it has not been paid, but the payment may not have been posted yet on the county's Web site, Bettencourt said. 
""This is one of the bigger omitted properties (ever in the county),"" he said, though Enron can still appeal the appraised value. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said bankruptcy does not preclude the company from paying taxes. 
""I'm sure if they are appropriate, and if we owe them, we will pay them,"" Palmer said. 
Bettencourt said his office notified Enron of the oversight and tax due Jan. 31. The firm has 30 days to appeal. If it doesn't, it has 45 days to pay the tax before becoming delinquent. 
Enron created its broadband services unit in 1997, believing it could buy and sell Internet access like a commodity. But the venture reported steep losses each quarter. 
In January 2001, Enron's then-president Jeff Skilling touted the unit's moneymaking potential at a time when its 2,000 employees were having trouble finding customers and the firm was trying to sell its single hard asset, an 18,000-mile fiber-optic data network. 
In April 2001, the unit tried to sell millions of dollars worth of computers and telecommunications equipment stockpiled at a warehouse. That appears to be some of the equipment the firm neglected to pay taxes on in 2001, Bettencourt said.

Enron To Fight Astros Attempt To Get Ballpark Name Back
By Kathy Chu

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) is challenging the Houston Astros' attempt to step up to the plate to reclaim a Texas stadium's naming rights.
Earlier Tuesday, the Astros filed a motion with a New York bankruptcy court, asking a federal judge presiding over Enron's case to force the company to accept or reject a 30-year, $100 million licensing agreement that christened a Houston ballpark ""Enron Field."" 
If the bankrupt company cannot guarantee future payments - as the Astros believe is the likely case - Enron must immediately end the contract so another buyer can be found, according to the baseball team. 
In court documents, the Astros said that the team's image has been ""tainted"" by its association with Enron, and that ""unique and irreparable harm"" will result from any further ties to a company that is alleged to have misled creditors and shareholders. 
But Martin Bienenstock, of Weil Gotshal & Manges, the law firm representing Enron, said that the Astros are just taking a swing at the distressed company's creditors while they're down. 
""It's particularly unfair for them to do this,"" said Bienenstock, who plans to challenge the motion in upcoming weeks. ""They're trying to aggravate the creditors' losses."" 
Enron has already paid $10 million under the licensing deal, and will not be able to recoup this amount if the contract is terminated. The company, even after filing for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, has continued to honor its financial obligations to the Astros, according to Bienenstock. 
On Jan. 22, Enron paid the Astros $108,000 for a 14-person luxury suite in the ballpark. Last Monday, the company wrote a check for about $90,000 for 35 season box seats. 
Enron is keeping up with these bills - which are required under the contract - so that later, it may be able to assign the naming rights to a third party and recoup some money for creditors, according to Bienenstock. 
""Even if the license agreement says we can't (assign these rights), the bankruptcy code usually makes transferrable or assignable things that are not outside of bankruptcy,"" he said. 
The baseball team said it will leave legal interpretations to the bankruptcy judge. 
But even if the contract is terminated, Enron won't be walking away empty-handed, according to Pam Gardner, president of business operations for the Astros, because the bankrupt company has received baseball seats and advertising in exchange for the $10 million it spent. 
""We just want the court to let us know sooner than later (about the contract) so that we can move on with our business,"" said Gardner. 
Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, plans to hear the matter on Feb. 27. 
For now, Enron's decision to keep its name on the stadium may have some value - even if the company doesn't decide to transfer the rights to another party. 
""It makes sense not to burn any bridges for the naming rights,"" said Joel Kay, a bankruptcy attorney at Hughes, Watters & Askanase LLP in Houston. ""It could be valuable depending on what the company looks like when it reorganizes.""

Houston - The Houston Astros don't want the name ""Enron Field"" atop their 2-year-old ballpark. 
""Thousands of people who have been adversely affected by the Enron collapse are being reminded on a daily basis of this continuing tragedy,"" attorneys for Astros owner Drayton McLane wrote in a motion filed yesterday with the New York court overseeing Enron's bankruptcy.
The team wants the bankruptcy court to force Enron to decide whether to honor the 30-year, $100-million naming rights agreement signed in 1999. The former energy giant's next payment for Enron Field's naming rights is due Aug. 31. The Astros say it isn't realistic to expect Enron to be able to make the $3.7-million payment. 
""The Enron logo displayed on the Stadium wrongly suggests to the public that the Astros are associated with the alleged bad business practices of Enron,"" the motion states. ""As it stands, the Houston Astros arguably are viewed as Enron's team."" 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company's naming rights agreement with the team is a valuable asset the former energy giant is not willing to give up. 
Pam Gardner, Astros president of business operations, said since Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, the company has spent about $108,000 for a suite and nearly $90,000 for 2002 season box seats as required in the license agreement. Enron has made three annual payments totaling $10.25 million and is current on its payments, the Astros said. 
Denne says she isn't sure how the team is being harmed. ""How good a team they are is determined by how they play on the field, not the name on the stadium,"" she said.

U.S. labour secretary to testify as hearings continue in Enron collapse
BY MARCY GORDON
AP

02/06/2002
The Canadian Press
Copyright (c) 2002 The Canadian Press. All rights reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) _ The subpoenas are multiplying, the hearings mushrooming in Congress' investigation into the collapse of Enron Corp., a once powerful company transformed into a symbol of American corporate failure. 
``The thought of employees sustaining huge losses while executives were able to sell stock for millions is infuriating,'' Senator Joseph Lieberman said Tuesday. He announced plans to issue a subpoena to get information about bonuses paid to company executives in the run-up to its Dec. 2 bankruptcy.
Lieberman spoke after a laid-off worker tearfully described losing $40,000 US from her retirement account last fall as Enron slid toward collapse. 
The hearings were picking up again Wednesday, with one committee hearing from Labour Secretary Elaine Chao about Bush administration plans to strengthen retirement account protections for millions of workers. Two other panels were to be active as well. 
On Tuesday, Joseph Berardino, chairman of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, drew the wrath of House of Representatives members over Andersen's handling of Enron and the shredding of documents. 
""You have squandered the integrity of your company,'' Representative Gary Ackerman (D_N.Y.) told him. 
Berardino's response to the criticism: ""At the end of the day, we do not cause companies to fail.'' 
As no less than four congressional panels met on the Enron debacle, the Senate Commerce Committee approved a subpoena for Kenneth Lay, the former head of Enron who cancelled plans to appear voluntarily Monday. ""We have no choice,'' said Senator Byron Dorgan (D_N.D.). 
Representative Michael Oxley, head of the House banking committee, signed a subpoena for Lay to appear before his panel on Feb. 14, two days after the Senate appearance. 
Lay's lawyer Earl Silbert dismissed any suggestion that Lay was ``making himself scarce'' to avoid investigators. 
Legislators predicted Lay would invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he appears. 
A dozen committees are investigating Enron, along with the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission. The energy-trading company has deep political ties in Washington, and politicians in both parties have scrambled to distance themselves from Enron. 
The Justice Department has rejected calls by some Democrats for a special prosecutor. 
""This is a business problem that our Justice Department is going to investigate, and if there's wrongdoing we'll hold them accountable for mistreatment of employees and shareholders,'' President George W. Bush said Tuesday. 
Millions of investors lost money, and thousands of current and former Enron employees lost the great bulk of their retirement savings, when the company collapsed. An Enron-sponsored investigation released over the weekend blamed senior management for failing to provide proper supervision over a complex web of partnerships that helped the company hide debt and post unrealistic profit figures. 
Once disclosed, the transactions contributed to the company's unravelling. 
The biggest fireworks Tuesday were reserved for Berardino. 
Oxley noted that the Enron internal investigation found active participation by Andersen in setting up the partnerships, and that the accounting firm had received $5.7 million for advice on the subject. 
""You weren't just checking the boxes,'' he told Berardino, who claimed that he wasn't in the loop and that Andersen's auditors didn't actively participate in setting up the partnerships. 
""I did not do the audit of the company,'' Berardino said. ""Information was withheld from us.'' 
Lead Enron auditor David Duncan was fired in January, accused by his employer of organizing the destruction of Enron documents. 
The committee also heard testimony about a period of roughly three weeks last fall when individuals were barred from selling any stock in their retirement accounts, a lockout attributed to a change in plan administrators. 
Because the price of Enron stock was dropping at the time, officials debated whether to postpone the lockout, but eventually decided not to. The company found ``it was not feasible to notify more than 20,000 participants in a timely fashion,'' said Cindy Olson, Enron's executive vice-president for human resources. 
Enron's stock peaked at $82 a share on Jan. 26, 2001. It was selling for $15.40 at the close of trading on Oct. 26, the day the lockout began, and had fallen to $9.98 on Nov. 13, the day it ended. 
At another hearing, the author of the withering Enron internal investigation described how the executives ``enriched themselves ... by tens of millions of dollars'' through questionable partnerships.

LAY KNEW THERE WAS TROUBLE, BOARD MEMBER SAYS
CHRIS MONDICS AND DAVE MONTGOMERY, KNIGHT RIDDER NEWSPAPERS

A-6
(Copyright 2002)

Kenneth Lay, Enron Corp.'s former chief executive officer, had detailed knowledge of deals that presented a misleading picture of the company's finances to the public, the chief author of a scathing internal report told Congress yesterday. 
""It was clear to us that he knew,"" said Williams Powers Jr., an Enron board member and head of a special committee that investigated several transactions that led to the company's collapse. ""I can tell you what his story was -- that he didn't believe there was anything wrong with it, that the accountants had signed off on it.""
Powers' testimony before the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee's investigative subcommittee, one of at least 10 panels delving into Enron's fall, challenged Lay's self-portrait of an innocent chief executive isolated from the dealing of subordinates who have drawn much of the blame for the collapse. 
Pressure on Lay intensified yesterday when two congressional committees ordered subpoenas compelling his appearance next week. The 59-year-old former executive abruptly canceled a scheduled appearance Monday before the Senate Commerce Committee, enraging lawmakers and further inflaming the anti-Enron mood on Capitol Hill. 
The House Financial Services Committee ordered Lay to appear Feb. 14. The Senate Commerce Committee had not decided on a date. Several lawmakers speculated that Lay would choose not to testify and invoke Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. 
Lawmakers of both parties are eager to confront Lay with stories of ordinary citizens who held pensions heavily based on Enron stock only to see their retirement accounts evaporate. Meanwhile, Lay and other top executives made millions of dollars by selling their stock before the company collapsed. 
Powers' report, released over the weekend, concluded that top Enron executives used hundreds of partnerships to conceal losses and overstate profits, enabling the company to show a robust stock performance. 
Yesterday, House investigators said they had learned that former executives Michael J. Kopper and Ben Glisan tried to get a subordinate fired when he protested that one of the partnerships was not in the company's interest. When those threats failed, former Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow, architect of many of the transactions under investigation, left a profanity-laden message on the employee's voice mail, investigators said. 
Several lawmakers said they found it hard to believe that Lay would be unaware of bogus transactions during his stewardship of the company. 
Powers, who also testified Monday, told the House panel that Lay was well aware of several so-called ""hedge"" transactions, in which the company created an appearance that an independent third party was obligated to cover its losses in the stock market. But, in reality, Enron had a substantial economic stake in the third-party entity, meaning any losses would actually affect Enron's bottom line. 
When the losses came, Enron was forced to restate its earnings, and the resulting loss of investor confidence sent its stock plunging. The company declared bankruptcy Dec. 2. 
In other House testimony yesterday, Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino cast auditors as helpless victims of what he called a ""bad system"" of financial reporting. 
Berardino tried to cast doubt on the credibility of Powers' report, which faulted the Chicago auditing firm, in part, for Enron's collapse. Berardino said the committee didn't interview Andersen, which signed off on Enron's questionable deals. ""We begged them to talk to us,"" he said.

Washington --- Members of Congress investigating the collapse of Enron said employees of the energy trading giant were threatened when they were too aggressive in representing the company's interests. 
""What we know is that there was a lot of self-dealing going on,"" said Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.). One Enron employee was threatened with firing and others were told their bonuses were endangered if they took too hard a line for the firm in negotiations involving executive-run partnerships outside the company, said Tauzin, head of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He did not provide details.
The partnerships, run by then-Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and his subordinate, Michael Kopper, allowed Enron to report profits that didn't exist and to hide debt. 
Enron's stock price collapsed and the Houston company filed for bankruptcy court protection in December after it reversed almost $600 million in profits. 
Fastow and Kopper are to appear before Tauzin's committee on Thursday, as is Jeffrey Skilling, a former Enron chief executive. 
Another House committee and a Senate committee Tuesday subpoenaed Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and CEO at the time of the collapse. 
In congressional hearings Tuesday: 
> University of Texas law school dean William Powers said Enron executives were making ""systematic and pervasive"" efforts to keep investors and the board of directors in the dark about the energy company's financial condition and deals that enriched some employees by millions of dollars. Powers, who led an Enron investigation into the partnerships, was testifying for a second day. 
> Joseph Berardino, chief executive of Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditing firm, faced fierce questioning from lawmakers frustrated that he could not explain why the accounting firm failed to detect irregularities. 
Berardino accused Enron of withholding information from the auditors. 
""You have squandered the integrity of your company,"" Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) told Berardino. ""You have enabled the enrichment of the greedy at the price of destroying the dreams of so many decent, innocent people. That is totally unacceptable."" 
> Some Enron employees said they received retention bonus shortly before the company's bankruptcy filing, while others recounted their retirement losses. 
Mikie Rath, a benefits manager, said she received a retention bonus ""in excess of $20,000."" 
On the other hand, Deborah Perrotta said she lost $40,000 in retirement savings. Perrotta, who worked as a senior administrative assistant at Enron, started crying as she told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that she could no longer pay for her daughter's wedding. 
""This isn't right,"" she said. ""We worked hard, many of us worked as hard as we possibly could. . . . When Enron told us that its business was sound and its stock was to go up, we believed them."" 
Speaking in Pittsburgh, President Bush said Tuesday his administration will fully investigate the Enron case. ""If there's wrongdoing, we'll hold them accountable for mistreatment of employees and shareholders,"" Bush said. 
Meanwhile, members of the Senate Commerce Committee voted to issue a subpoena ordering Lay to testify before them after he refused to appear voluntarily on Monday. His lawyer cited the ""prosecutorial"" atmosphere in Congress. 
""The Enron ship is at the bottom of the ocean. The only way to get down there and figure out how it sank is to get to the captain,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the Senate panel. 
The House Financial Services Committee also voted to subpoena Lay. Lawmakers acknowledged he may invoke constitutional rights against self-incrimination and refuse to testify. 
""I'll bet you a dollar to a doughnut that Lay won't testify, that he'll invoke his Fifth Amendment right,"" declared Sen. John Breaux (D- La). 
Lay's attorney, Earl Silbert, said Tuesday that he already received one of the subpoenas. He dismissed any notion that his client was in hiding. There had been reports late Monday and early Tuesday that Lay had disappeared. 
Any suggestion that Lay is ""making himself scarce"" is ""absolute nonsense. He's in Houston with his family,"" Silbert said. 
Powers, the law school dean who issued a scathing report late Saturday on Enron's partnership deals, told Congress Tuesday that Lay and other top executives failed in their duties by allowing Fastow to create the flawed partnerships or by not exercising proper oversight. 
Powers said Fastow and Kopper cajoled some employees with ""extremely abnormal"" profits from investments in some of the thousands of partnerships Enron created. 
Enron accountant Ben Glisan Jr. and in-house attorney Kristina Mordaunt were paid about $1 million each in May 2000, within two months after investing $5,800 each in Southampton Place LP, a limited partnership with ties to Kopper and the Fastow Family Foundation, according to Powers' report. The Fastow foundation received $4.5 million from its $25,000 investment in Southampton.

TAKING STOCK
'Enronitis' sufferers won't tolerate creative accounting

Enron the company is an insolvent basket case that almost certainly will not survive in any recognizable form. But the Enron name is destined to live on for many years as the perfect symbol of all that was wrong with the stock market bubble. 
In its next life, Enron will exist solely as a rather nasty noun or verb to describe everything from the conning of employees and shareholders to the pocketing of politicians and the weakening of government regulations.
Already, we have a U.S. senator saying he didn't want ""to Enron"" Americans. And such endearing terms have crept into our lexicon as ""Enronize"" -- referring to the rapid vaporization of published profit or surpluses. Example: How did the Bush administration Enronize the budget? 
Then there's ""Enronitis"" -- the spreading virus among investors who have lost their faith in regulators, auditors, directors and any others in the food chain who are supposed to ensure that the numbers released by companies have some basis in reality. 
Other former darlings of the bubble years played just as fast and loose with those wonderfully elastic accounting rules that too many investors mistakenly trusted for far too long. And most are paying for it dearly now in the public markets. 
Global Crossing has followed Enron into the shelter of bankruptcy court. And like Enron it has belatedly acknowledged that one of its own executives had alleged last summer that the books were being cooked -- although no one thought it important enough to mention this to the auditors or the board of directors. Taking another cue from Enron, the telecom company has appointed a special board committee to look into its own accounting practices. 
If it does uncover accounting irregularities, maybe Global Crossing will get lucky and find a scapegoat as perfect as Andrew Fastow, Enron's greedy former chief financial officer, the architect of its off-balance-sheet vehicles and its whipping boy of choice. 
Tyco International, the General Electric wannabe, has come under a withering attack from equity and debt holders for its own creative accounting and what-they-don't-know-won't-hurt-us approach to public disclosure. The bubble-built empire has just revealed that it spent $8-billion (U.S.) on more than 700 acquisitions over the past three years that it did not consider necessary to disclose separately to the investing public. 
Tyco is on firm legal ground here, having provided the minimum it was required to under existing accounting rules in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Most of the deals amounted to less than $50-million each. That isn't regarded as material for a conglomerate with about $36-billion in annual revenue. 
But this isn't the time to be keeping financial information from an investing public that is plainly fed up with being treated as a necessary evil by anything-goes corporate bosses. 
Enron, too, provided what its special committee called ""substantial factual information"" about its off-balance-sheet dealings in quarterly and annual reports and proxy statements. 
But even though the disclosures were approved by the auditors and lawyers, the committee concluded that they ""were obtuse, did not communicate the essence of the transactions completely or clearly and failed to convey the substance of what was going on."" 
Oh yes, and the reports didn't bother mentioning that Mr. Fastow had a huge conflict of interest and was raking in millions of dollars on the side. 
After they were so badly burned, who can blame investors who are now fleeing for the hills when they decide that the finances of a particular company are too opaque or the least bit dodgy or simply too complex to be easily digested? And that could sink an exceedingly complicated company like Tyco, which will have to refinance more than $11-billion worth of debt in the next 18 months. 
It may well reach a point where investment pros end up following the lead of those who are used to operating in regions where earnings transparency is as alien as shareholder rights. If, as in Enron's case, you can't even trust the numbers filed quarterly with the SEC or other securities regulators -- the ones that are supposed to conform to generally accepted accounting principles -- how do you evaluate an investment? 
Well, in certain parts of the world that are not widely known for full financial disclosure, good money managers can't afford to take the accounting or the usual financial ratios at face value. They look, instead, at longer-term performance trends, the record of management credibility and for signs of what one emerging markets expert calls ""positive change."" 
The rule of thumb is always to read the footnotes in the financial statements with extreme care, and treat the comments from company officials as little more than light entertainment. 
At this rate, any North American company that dresses up its financial picture with pro forma accounting (often to exclude such inconvenient items as acquisition costs) or plays other tricks with numbers will find itself hammered mercilessly, even when it has done nothing illegal and has a decent enough track record. 
That will be one of the Enronies of this whole accounting debacle.

USA: US Corp Bonds - ""Enronization"" tightens its grip.
By Nancy Leinfuss

(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

NEW YORK, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Battered by the Enron contagion, corporate bond spreads have blown out significantly over the last week as investors, fearing they may tread on the next land mine, look to unload corporate debt. 
""It's the Enronization of the market - the perception that there may be other Enrons lurking out there,"" said one high-grade trader. ""The most likely candidate in this market is Tyco, based more on perception than reality,"" he said.
Mounting accounting concerns at U.S. companies, following the sudden collapse of energy trading giant Enron Corp., and fears over deteriorating corporate credit worth and balance sheets have pushed spreads out by 0.20 to 0.30 percentage point over the last week. 
""There's hysteria right now. It's not rational thinking by investors,"" said Colin Lundgren, portfolio manager at American Express Asset Management in St. Paul, Minnesota. 
""Taking these companies apart and searching for another Enron out there, we'll find out that there aren't a lot of them,"" he said. ""Maybe some information will come out in terms of accounting issues, but nowhere near the hysteria that seems to built in the market today."" 
Spreads - the yield margin between corporate bonds and similar maturity Treasuries - were quoted 0.05 to 0.10 percentage point wider on Wednesday, continuing the trend from the prior week, traders said. 
""Folks are looking for safety and security and the trades don't make sense,"" said Lundgren, referring to some investors fleeing corporates and jumping into Treasuries. ""Some decent companies that will likely surive and be around at the end of the day are just getting beaten over the head with a two-by-four,"" he said.

MADRID (AFX) - Energy sector regulator Comision Nacional de la Energia (CNE) is planning to investigate Enron Corp's distribution operations in Spain. 
Speaking to reporters, CNE chairman Pedro Merono said the investigation follows electricity pool regulator OMEL's suspension of Enron Espana Energia's operations in December.
But he stressed that this (investigation) ""is only related to Enron Espana's distribution activity... It has nothing to do with its generation business.""

The spotlight of the Enron Corp. investigators is moving to the company's outside help: the lobbyists, consultants and board members who lent the mantle of respectability to what turns out not to have been respectable. 
The outcome is likely to be the usual: more laws. But it is not clear that even a mountain of legislation can prevent the sort of failure we see in the Enron case. The wrongness, and stupidity, of putting your reputation at risk in exchange for a big fee is the kind of gut knowledge that every professional should carry around in his or her head.
The same holds for recognizing what constitutes a huge conflict of interest--especially if you are in a self-regulated field, such as accountancy. 
Partners at Anderson appear to have ended up ignoring what Michael Groom of Britain's Institute of Chartered Accountants calls ""the sniff factor."" When something is right by the books, but wrong by the nose, you have to trust the nose. 
Even your average lowlife knows that. Indeed, the ethics of professional service were laid out by a lowlife: Philip Marlowe, the down-and-dirty detective of Raymond Chandler's novels. 
In ""The Big Sleep,"" Marlowe follows a three-stage process of client management that might have helped Enron's friends to avoid their own Big Sleep of inattention. 
- First, establish your fee. Make it standard. That is vital because it helps you to keep your independence. Consider Marlowe on his own rate card. ""For 25 bucks a day and expenses, mostly gasoline and whiskey, I do my thinking myself, what there is of it; I risk my whole future, the hatred of the cops and of Eddie Mars and his pals, I dodge bullets and eat saps, and say: `Thank you very much, if you have any more trouble, I hope you'll think of me. I'll just leave one of my cards in case anything comes up.'"" 
- Second, beware your own greed. Life has not treated Marlowe the way he deserves. He has a small office, no secretary and an unhealthy fondness for cigarettes and double scotches. Like some of the advisers who served Enron, he nurses that most treacherous of resentments, the resentment of the underappreciated talent. What a life that talent could live if only it were paid what it deserved! 
Marlowe is therefore sorely tempted when approached by the detective's equivalent of Enron: a millionaire's daughter in a pair of oyster-colored pajamas. It does not help that those pajamas come trimmed with white fur. He even dreams aloud about what he might do with her cash: ""I could own a home and a new car and four suits of clothes,"" he tells her. ""I might even take a vacation without worrying about losing a case."" 
- Third, when someone wants to make you a generous payment--in Andersen's case, fees for consultancy as well as auditing--ask why. ""Now you offer me 15 grand. That makes me a big shot,"" Marlowe says to Vivian Regan on her chaise lounge. The exorbitant rate somehow confirms one's own dream of one's worth. But is it realistic? Marlowe is man enough to put down his cigarette and ask: ""What are you offering it to me for?"" And to collect his hat and walk out on the oyster-colored pajamas. 
""What are you offering it to me for?"" is the big question, the one that many who connected with Enron as consultants or lobbyists failed to pursue sufficiently. The danger is that when we trade away something beyond our standard handiwork, that something is usually our professional reputation. 
That reputation is so precious--even to Marlowe--that he turns down a second wild lady, Vivian's sister Carmen: ""It's a question of professional pride. You know-- professional pride. I'm working for your father."" 
Useful corollaries to Marlowe's list might include: ""If you don't know, find out. If you can't find out, say so."" Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's chief executive, was a notoriously dismissive boss; in the public space of conference calls, he scolded investment analysts who queried his complex accounting methods. Enron made it so difficult and painful for analysts to research the company more deeply that most of them failed to do so. 
Of course, no professional with a career behind him can say he did the right thing every time. Marlowe could not. Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade was frank about this in ""The Maltese Falcon."" ""We didn't exactly believe your story, Miss O'Shaughnessy; we believed your $200 . . . I mean, you paid us more than if you'd been telling us the truth, and enough more to make it all right."" 
Still, we can all strive to do better, just like those bottom- feeders in the world of the 1930s detective (a ""self-regulating"" place if there ever was one). And when a too-luscious offer materializes before us, we could do worse than ask ourselves Marlowe's big question: ""What are you offering it to me for?""

Sour Note? Here's What Happens To Whistleblowers After They Sound Off --- For Some Future Employers, Integrity Trumps Corporate Loyalty
By Joann S. Lublin
Staff Reporter

The Asian Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp. executive Sherron Watkins never intended to become a whistle-blower by helping expose the practices that triggered her company's financial collapse. 
When Jeffrey Skilling, president of the Houston energy concern, abruptly quit in August, Enron officials set up a special letter-collection box so employees could anonymously vent their worries. Ms. Watkins, vice president for corporate development, wrote an unsigned, one-page note to then-Chairman Kenneth Lay. ""Has Enron become a risky place to work?"" her letter asked, after questioning its irregular accounting methods.
""I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals,"" she continued. ""My eight years of Enron will be worth nothing on my resume."" 
Nothing may be further from the truth. Ms. Watkins's subsequent experience suggests that whistle-blowing need not blow your career. Informers about workplace misdeeds can minimize career damage if they enjoy a strong reputation for honesty, management experts and former whistle-blowers say. 
Ms. Watkins, 42 years old, has been lauded for her courage since a House of Representatives committee investigating Enron released an expanded version of her letter last month. Her reluctant internal disclosure ""is going to be terrific for her career. It shows profound integrity and discretion,"" says Hal Reiter, CEO of New York recruiters Herbert Mines Associates. 
Though many whistle-blowers get forced out after going public, Enron's mess offers Ms. Watkins some job security. Even so, blowing the whistle within Enron ""wasn't an easy thing to do,"" says Philip Hilder, a Houston attorney representing Ms. Watkins and speaking on her behalf. 
Ms. Watkins, shortly after writing the letter, accepted a colleague's suggestion to divulge her identity and meet with Mr. Lay, where she detailed her concerns. That session prompted the company to invite a law firm's investigation. Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2. 
Why didn't Ms. Watkins protect co-workers by alerting the SEC, asks Jeffrey Wigand. He is the research executive who blew the whistle on alleged wrongdoing by his former employer, Brown & Williamson Tobacco. He became an educator at one-tenth his former $300,000 salary. Keeping complaints in-house ""minimizes your career damage . . . as well as minimizes your integrity,"" he believes. 
Ms. Watkins didn't contact securities regulators because she was challenging accounting practices approved by Enron lawyers and accountants, Mr. Hilder replies. 
In Asia, whistle-blowing is less common. Many companies are tightly-knit family-run enterprises that share little internal information with their employees. Asian executive recruiters and management consultants point out that those senior employees who do have access to such information are often bound to their employees through family or clan links, making whistle-blowing almost tantamount to personal betrayal. 
In 1981, Jerry Giordano, then a 37-year-old marketing director, caused an internal ruckus but didn't inform authorities when he found what he says were unlawful pricing practices at a small West Coast industrial-products manufacturer. To make old products appear new, he says, the maker repackaged them, falsified engineering specifications and ordered him to pitch them before salespeople. A former Federal Trade Commission official advised him the small business wouldn't likely be prosecuted. 
Mr. Giordano confided his dilemma to a friend he had worked for at a defense contractor. The former boss had commended his integrity when he exposed hidden cost overruns at their former company. Both left for other jobs. ""He created a job for me"" at his new employer, he says. 
Good thing. Before he could resign, he was fired for sending a memo to colleagues about the company's packaging practices that concluded ""being indicted looks bad on your resume."" Mr. Giordano, now the 58-year-old CEO of Criterium-Mooney Engineers, civil-engineering consultants in Portland, Maine, would gladly hire Ms. Watkins. ""She did the right thing by going to the top,"" he says. 
At the moment, Mr. Hilder says, Ms. Watkins isn't thinking about whether her internal whistle-blowing might harm her career. ""If the time ever comes when she needs to seek employment, she will rest on her abilities,"" the attorney insists. 
Barbara Provus, a principal of Chicago recruiters Shepherd Bueschel & Provus, is skeptical. ""Very few companies really want a corporate conscience,"" she says. 
Renwick T. Nelson learned that lesson after exposing allegedly deceptive life-insurance sales practices at Prudential Financial. He gave a sworn anonymous statement to Florida's attorney general in 1996 before he switched jobs at Prudential, from top marketing-practices officer to a $300,000-a-year post as a compliance officer. But he was fired in March 1997, according to his Dec. 5 testimony in a Miami federal court case stemming from the allegations. 
Following his dismissal, Mr. Nelson sent out numerous resumes -- and never got any interviews. He has a hunch why. ""Senior management in the corporate world seems to think they are owed complete loyalty and whistle-blowing indicates that you may be loyal to something else,"" he says. 
Since July 2000, the 57-year-old has been a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer in Tonga, happily teaching business-writing on the South Pacific island. What career guidance would he offer Ms. Watkins? ""She will feel isolated and vilified, but ultimately she will know that what she did was right. Nothing can diminish that knowledge.""

Enron, cows and a whole lot of bull.
By Pratap Ravindran.

02/06/2002
Business Line (The Hindu)
(c) 2002 The Hindu Business Line

MUMBAI, Feb. 5 
WHEN Enron went boom, a good many people got singed in the hip pocket - but the falling debris also hit a lot of folks in the funny bone.
Thus, a popular bulletin board on the Net seeks to define the difference between traditional capitalism and Enron capitalism. 
In traditional capitalism, you start off with two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income. 
With capitalism Enron style, you again start off with two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt-equity swap with an associated general offer so that you can get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred through an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The Enron annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.... 
And then there's Dave Barry (Knight Ridder Tribune) who has sought to explain the Enron collapse, using simple financial terms (such as dirtballs), for the benefit of the average layperson whose grasp of high finance consists of knowing his or her ATM code. It's in a Q&A format and goes like this (extracts): 
Q. How, exactly, did Enron make money? 
A. Nobody knows. This is usually the case with corporations whose names sound like fictional planets from Star Wars. Allegedly, Enron was in the energy business, but when outside investigators finally looked into it, they discovered that the only actual energy source in the entire Enron empire was a partially used can of Sterno in the basement of corporate headquarters. Using a financial technique called ""leveraging,"" Enron executives were able to turn this asset into a gigantic enterprise whose stock was valued at billions of dollars. 
Q. What does ""leveraging"" mean? 
A. Lying. 
Q. Why didn't Wall Street realise that Enron was a fraud? 
A. Because Wall Street relies on ""stock analysts."" These are people who do research on companies and then, no matter what they find, even if the company has burned to the ground, enthusiastically recommend that investors buy the stock. They are just a bunch of cockeyed optimists. When the Titanic was in its deathly throes, with the propellers sticking straight up in the air, there was a stock analyst clinging to the railing, asking people around him where he could buy a ticket for the return trip. 
Q. So the analysts gave Enron a favourable rating? 
A. Oh, yes. Enron stock was rated ""Can't Miss"" until it became clear that the company was in desperate trouble, at which point analysts lowered the rating to ""Sure Thing."" 
Only when Enron went completely under did a few bold analysts demote its stock to the lowest possible Wall Street rating, ""Hot Buy."" 
Dave Barry gets in a dig against the Enron directors too: 
Q. Doesn't Enron have a board of directors whose members are responsible for overseeing the corporation? 
A. Yes. They are paid $3,00,000 a year. 
Q. So how could they have allowed this flagrant deception to go on? 
A. They are paid $300,000 a year. And then there are the Jay Leno-isms: 
""It was cold today. I was rubbing my hands together more than Dick Cheney at an Enron payday;"" 
""People are still talking about President Bush's big State of the Enron, I mean, Union, speech;"" and 
""Dick Cheney finally responded today to demands that he reveal the details of the Enron meetings. This is what he said. He met with unnamed people, from unspecified companies, for an indeterminate period of time at an undisclosed location. Thank God he cleared that up. I'm ready to move on..."" 
The last word to David Letterman: ""Enron CEO Kenneth Lay has sold all of his Enron stock. I guess we all know that. In fact, the only thing he owns now is the Bush Administration.""

Satire
Ken Lay's un-American activities
There is only one force that could be responsible for this man's undermining of the capitalist system!
- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Andrew Leonard
Feb. 6, 2002 | My fellow congressional leaders, a specter is haunting America -- the specter of Enron. A gang of economic terrorists, cloaking their activities under the guise of ""innovation"" and ""deregulation,"" has undermined the basic principles upon which the economy of the United States is founded. 
A glance at the falling stock market proves that a nation's trust in quarterly earnings reports has been shaken. No longer can we look to Wall Street for an honest appraisal of corporate health. Worst of all, decades of work devoted to freeing markets from the unhealthy influence of heavy-handed government intervention have been undermined by a band of renegades. 
And as if that wasn't enough, the leader of this pirate mob has now committed his greatest indignity against the American people -- former Enron CEO Ken Lay is refusing to defend his actions before Congress. He may even follow the lead of his former employees, Andrew Fastow and Michael Kopper, and hide behind the protection of the Fifth Amendment. 
Not since the Hollywood Ten refused to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee has this nation witnessed such a brazen display of impudent pusillanimity. Let us recall -- even Oliver North had the guts to defend his actions before Congress. But of course, Oliver North is a true patriot, dedicated to defending the values that make this country great, whereas Ken Lay and company apparently care little about how vigorously they are dragging the American flag through the mud. 
Some of my esteemed colleagues have made the feeble, and obviously political, argument that Ken Lay is no villain, but merely a symptom of larger, systemic problems. They would have us believe that Enron's excesses are a result of deregulation, and that the greed of Enron's executives is a natural corollary to a political ethos that holds tax cuts as the highest public good and exalts the maximization of profits as the sublimest expression of civic duty. While they might agree that Ken Lay's actions are unethical and possibly illegal, they see his behavior as a consequence of decades of special-interest lobbying and not as a gross departure from acceptable entrepreneurial standards. 

To this I cry, ""Have you no shame?"" To turn the Enron debacle into a political football is vile demagoguery. It is an insult to every chief executive who has ever succeeded in steering his company to 20 percent annual growth and to every stock investor who has earned windfall profits from an IPO. To draw attention to Mr. Lay's political connections in the service of partisan bickering is nothing but a mockery of justice, and an attempt to disguise the perfidiousness that is at the core of Enron. I ask you, my fellow leaders, do not besmirch the capitalist ethic with the stain of Enron. No, our task here is far more important than the scoring of legislative points. 
In this perilous age for our nation, we must be as alert to attacks from within as from without. It would be all too easy to focus so attentively on the axis of evil binding North Korea, Iran and Iraq together that we miss the equally challenging dangers posed by domestic villains. That is why I am calling today for the reestablishment of the House Un-American Activities Committee. For there is obviously nothing more un-American than Ken Lay. Is there a pillar of the American economy that has not been tarnished by Ken Lay? 
?	Enron has single-handedly ruined the reputation of one of our finest accounting firms -- Arthur Andersen -- and by extension, cast grave doubt on the entire accounting industry's ability to serve as its own watchdog, or anyone else's.
?	Enron's behavior will no doubt encourage American citizens to lose their faith in hardworking and honest Wall Street analysts. Imagine the economic chaos if every buy recommendation is suddenly interpreted as an encouragement to sell!
?	Enron has reduced the reliability of the business press to tatters. A generation of fine reporters and editors are no doubt heartsick and ulcer-ridden after being seduced by the siren song of Ken Lay's velvet eloquence.
?	Enron has besmirched the integrity of both political parties. When everyone from Jesse Jackson to George W. Bush turns out to have supped at the Enron trough, the American people can be readily excused for thinking that all politicians are bought and paid for.
Again, my colleagues would have you believe in their absurd notion that all politicians really are merely the pawns of their campaign contributors. Even more audaciously, they will stand here and thunder until their throats grow hoarse that the business press, Wall Street and the accounting industry are all equally to blame for the Enron mess, and that all of these problems are the fault of our elected leadership. The system, they whine incessantly, is broken. Greed is the only law of the land, they whimper. 

Piffle! The litany of crimes committed by Ken Lay and his associates is too great to be explained away by the petty motivators of greed or avarice, and too evil to be blamed on the ludicrous bogeyman of ""the system."" No, my fellow Americans, it is clear that there is something far more insidious at work here. The damage wreaked against capitalism by Enron is so vast, so troubling in its extent and so awesome in its comprehensiveness, that we must look elsewhere for answers. 

The American people demand those answers. Ken Lay's lawyer says he doesn't know his current whereabouts. Such delinquence is unacceptable! He must be brought before the highest elected officials of this land, whether it be of his own free will or hauled before a new, revived HUAC in leg irons and handcuffs. 

He must be called to account, and when he does appear before Congress, God help him if he dares hide behind the Constitution when confronted with the obvious, pressing question of the day: 

""Sir, are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist Party?""

Ex-Enron CFO Seeks Immunity Deal With Justice - Sources
By Jason Leopold

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Attorneys for former Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow are attempting to work out a deal with U.S. Department of Justice officials that would grant Fastow immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony on Enron's collapse, people close to Fastow said.
Until a deal is reached, Fastow will invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself if asked to testify before any congressional committee investigating Enron, those people said. 
""Right now he's concentrating on working out a deal with the Justice Department that would get him full immunity in exchange for any information into Enron,"" a person close to Fastow said. ""Everything else, including the congressional hearings, are secondary and will be dealt with only if a deal with the Justice Department is reached."" 
People close to Fastow said they believe the Justice Department's criminal investigation is focusing heavily on the former CFO and whether he intentionally misled Enron's shareholders by hiding losses in off-balance-sheet partnerships, some of which he ran. 
Bryan Sierra, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, wouldn't comment, saying the investigation into Enron is ongoing. 
Fastow's role in structuring partnerships that allowed Enron to hide losses and the fact that he ran some of those partnerships while serving as Enron's CFO are among the issues at the center of inquiries into the energy trader's collapse. 
Also at issue are the roles played by former Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling, Enron's board of directors, Enron auditor Arthur Andersen and law firm Vinson & Elkins. 
Seeking immunity makes sense given Fastow's position at the center of the financial arrangements in question and the possibility of criminal prosecution, said Sheldon Elsen, a securities attorney with Orans Elsen & Lupert in New York. 
""A guy in Fastow's position, who is involved in tremendous conflicts of interest, possibly insider trading, securities fraud, and he has a great deal of information into Enron finances, you make an immunity deal with the Department of Justice or you don't say anything otherwise it can be used against you,"" Elsen said. ""I would think it highly unlikely at this stage in the game that Fastow would go in and testify before a committee and say things that could be used against him. The people that count most in the end is the Justice Department, because they are the ones that can put you in jail."" 
But authorities might be reluctant to grant immunity, which hampered the prosecution of central figures in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s, Elsen said. 
Fastow was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer in October, after the company reported a $618 million loss in the third quarter and a $1.2 billion hit to shareholder equity stemming in part from transactions with partnerships he headed. 
A report prepared by a special Enron board committee and released over the weekend concluded that company executives pocketed large sums of cash while running complex partnerships used to disguise Enron's financial problems. Enron has said Fastow earned about $30 million working for the partnerships. 
Fastow is scheduled to testify Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin, R-La., said Sunday on Meet The Press that Fastow intends to invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. 
Fastow invoked his Fifth Amendment rights at one point late last year when questioned by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, people close to Fastow said. 
Fastow's attorneys have said previously that the former CFO's actions were approved by others and that he isn't responsible for Enron's collapse.

House Panel May Subpoena Testimony from Enron's Lay
By Judith Burns

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- A House Financial Services subcommittee voted Monday to authorize issuing a subpoena Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) former Chief Executive Kenneth Lay.
Lay was to have testified to the House panel Tuesday, but canceled abruptly, saying it appeared lawmakers had already made up their minds in advance of his appearance. 
Lawmakers, including Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio and Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., said a decision on whether to subpoena Lay would be made shortly. 
The House panel, chaired by Baker, kicked off a hearing into Enron on Monday with testimony from Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt. 
Pitt's testimony came after partisan wrangling about whether he should take a sworn oath. Republicans said there were no suggestions Pitt would lie, but Democrats insisted on a vote on the matter, which passed narrowly. 
Pitt said he had no problem taking the oath.

WASHINGTON (AP)--After former Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) chairman Kenneth Lay canceled an appearance Monday before a Senate committee investigating the bankrupt energy trading company, officials said lawmakers swiftly arranged to vote on a subpoena to compel his testimony. 
These officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Senate Commerce Committee would convene Tuesday morning - 24 hours after Lay had been scheduled to testify on the largest bankruptcy in the nation's history.
The decision to seek a vote on a subpoena followed a closed-door session involving key members of the panel. A news conference was scheduled to announce the developments.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 /PRNewswire/ -- House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) today expressed frustration with former Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay's refusal to testify before the House and Senate Committees responsible for investigating Enron's collapse. 
""We will get to the bottom of the Enron debacle and find out who is responsible for wrecking the retirement of so many Americans,"" DeLay said. ""I am very frustrated that Ken Lay failed to testify today. Both Enron's entire senior management team and Arthur Anderson owe the country a thorough explanation of the questionable business practices that destroyed this company. The sooner we have a full and open accounting of Enron's books, the better for all concerned.""

Congress plans to subpoena Lay
Enron director: Internal report findings were 'appalling'

By Nicole Maestri & Matt Andrejczak, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 2:27 PM ET Feb. 4, 2002
WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- Kenneth Lay will face a congressional subpoena from lawmakers who are irate at the former Enron chief's abrupt decision to pull out of planned testimony before two congressional panels this week.
""He will be subpoenaed,"" Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa., told CNBC on Monday. ""I can guarantee you that. He'll arrive either voluntarily or by subpoena.""
Greenwood is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's panel on oversights and investigations, which Lay had said he would appear before later this month. It now appears likely he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. 
Senators from the Senate Commerce Committee, who were forced Monday to cancel a hearing into the collapse of Enron since Lay pulled out, held a press conference to say they will vote Tuesday to subpoena the ex-chairman. 
The angered lawmakers said they wanted to learn just how much Lay knew about the way Enron was running its business. 
""Mr. Lay may contend, and I would stipulate it's theoretically possible, that Mr. Lay as CEO did not know what was going on beneath him,"" said Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill. But to believe that, Fitzgerald said, ""you would have to conclude that Mr. Lay was the most out to lunch CEO of any corporation in America.""
The House Financial Services Committee also plans to subpoena Lay.
""Mr. Lay's last-minute declaration not to appear at tomorrow's hearing is a most serious matter,"" a representative for House Financial Services Chairman Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, told Lay's attorney Earl Silbert in a letter on Monday.
While the Senate hearing was cancelled, a hearing by the House Financial Services Committee is underway, with testimony coming from Harvey Pitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Enron director William Powers.
Powers, who oversaw an internal report on Enron's collapse that was released Saturday, told lawmakers in prepared testimony: ""What we found was appalling."" 
According to Powers, Enron didn't follow accounting rules and its management routinely distorted its financial condition. 
Meantime, at the hearing, Pitt told the House panel the agency is planning a full-scale review of corporate disclosure laws to avoid another Enron-like tragedy. 
""There are fundamental longstanding flaws in our system -- and now they are on the table,"" Pitt said. 
The SEC chairman also urged the Financial Standards Accounting Board to set new audit standards on limited partnerships.
The internal report
Lay's refusal to appear on Capitol Hill came one day after an internal Enron report claimed executives at the company inflated profits and disguised the company's poor financial health. The investigative report said that said senior Enron executives hid more than $1 billion in losses by creating outside partnerships that made some of them millions of dollars while disguising the company's poor financial health.
The report from a special committee of Enron's board of directors headed by Powers, dean of the law school at the University of Texas, blasts Lay and former chief executive Jeff Skilling for the way the partnerships were structured and for lack of oversight over them. The company owned a 97 percent stake in those partnerships.
It notes that Lay ""bears significant responsibility for those flawed decisions."" And of Skilling, the report said he ""certainly knew or should have known of the magnitude and the risks associated with these transactions.""
Lay's attorney Silbert said the former chairman would not be appearing since the climate around the hearings had become ""prosecutorial.""
""Mr. Lay firmly rejects any allegations that he engaged in wrongful or criminal conduct,"" said the letter from Silbert, who served as a Justice Department prosecutor during the Watergate scandal in the early 1970's.
The abrupt cancellation marked the latest twist in an unfolding saga that's seen retirement savings of many of the company's employees wiped out and stockholders racking up huge losses, touching off a flurry of investigations by Congress and federal agencies.
Elsewhere
?	A group of large investors representing more than $2 trillion in assets urged the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday to overhaul the U.S. auditing and corporate governance systems to head off ""another Enron.""
?	Sunday, Andersen announced that it hired Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, to head an independent oversight board to advise on ""fundamental changes"" aimed at improving the quality of its audits and beginning the task of rebuilding public confidence in the firm. 
?	President Bush on Friday unveiled his proposal to revamp laws on retirement savings. He urged Congress to embrace an administration plan that would allow workers to sell company stock and diversify into other investment options after three years in their 401(k) plan.
Upcoming
?	The House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations launches three days of hearings Tuesday. Powers will be the sole witness Tuesday followed by a half-dozen accounting and corporate governance professors on Wednesday. Skilling and former CFO Andrew Fastow, who made $30 million from the partnerships, will take the stage on Thursday. Fastow is expected to invoke his Fifth Amendment right. Also up: former Enron officer Michael Kopper, Richard Causey, Enron's chief accountant, and Richard Buy, Enron's chief risk officer. 
?	Tuesday, Andersen CEO Joseph Berardino will testify to the House Financial Services Committee, which could make for some fireworks. Enron and its now-fired auditor Andersen have blamed each other in recent months for the company's downfall. In response to the report Saturday, Andersen said it ""fits Enron's established pattern of attempting to shift blame to others."" 
?	The Senate Health and Education Committee will hold a hearing Thursday focusing on pension laws and 401(k) retirement plans

Enron's Lay Faces Subpoenas From Congressional Panels
2002-02-04 14:56 (New York)
     Washington, Feb. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Lawmakers say they'll force former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay to appear before congressional committees investigating the collapse of what was once the largest energy trader.
     Senators Ernest Hollings and Byron Dorgan said they'll seek a subpoena for Lay to bring him before the Commerce Committee Feb. 12.  The House Financial Services Capital Markets Subcommittee unanimously authorized a subpoena for Lay today. Lay yesterday canceled scheduled appearances before both committees.
     Hollings also called for a special prosecutor to head the Justice Department investigation of Enron's failure because of financial and business ties between the company and members of President George W. Bush's administration.
     ""There are so many questions, and we wanted to start with the chairman and CEO, Mr. Lay, to ask him what happened, what do you know of what happened, who's accountable and who's responsible,'' Dorgan, who is leading the Senate Commerce Committee investigation into Enron, said at a news conference.
     A 203-page Enron internal review, released on Saturday, concluded that company executives enriched themselves while hiding at least $1 billion in losses in 3,000 partnerships that led to bankruptcy, the biggest in U.S. history. The study was commissioned by Enron's board and led by University of Texas Law School Dean William Powers.

Other Executives

     Former Enron Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling intends to keep his Thursday appointment with the House Energy and Commerce Committee and he'll answer questions, his spokeswoman Judy Leon said.
     Former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who the company said earned $30 million from buying and selling company property and assets, is scheduled to appear with Skilling Thursday before the commerce committee. His spokesman refused to comment on any aspect of Fastow's scheduled appearance.
     Powers is scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services subcommittee this afternoon, along with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt.
    The Powers report was a devastating indictment of what went on inside Enron, Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, said.
     ""Lay and others would do a service by telling the American people and Enron employees and investors what happened here,'' he said he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
     Dorgan said he expects the commerce committee to vote tomorrow to issue the subpoena. The House Financial Services panel, heading by Louisiana Republican Representative Richard Baker, authorized the committee chairman to subpoena Lay.

Critical Comments

     Dorgan and other lawmakers criticized Lay and Enron's management on yesterday and today. Republican Senator Peter Fitzgerald, a member of the commerce committee, said the report depicts ""a gigantic Ponzi operation.'' House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Billy Tauzin said yesterday on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' the Enron case may ``end up being security fraud.''
     Lay's attorney, Earl J. Silbert cited such comments in telling the Senate and House committees that his client wouldn't appear.
     ""These inflammatory statements show that judgments have been reached and the tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial,'' Silbert wrote in a letter to the Senate Commerce Committee yesterday.
     Legal analysts said Lay may take the same course as David Duncan, the fired Arthur Andersen LLP partner who invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to give testimony against himself at a House panel investigating the destruction of documents in the case.
     ""They just want to put him through the ritual of maybe coming down and invoking the Fifth in person,'' said John Q. Barrett, a former prosecutor and law professor at St. John's University in New York.

Inadequate Disclosures

     Lay may have waited until the eleventh hour to cancel because ""he was trying to minimize the time people would be bashing him'' for refusing to testify, Barrett said.
     Enron's internal report said the board's audit committee shared in the blame for inadequate disclosures in Enron's public filings, along with management, Arthur Andersen LLP and the company's longtime Houston law firm, Vinson & Elkins.
     Enron lawyer Robert Bennett said the report showed a resolve to find the facts and proved that ""the board was not provided a great deal of information that it should have had.''
     Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton called the report ""self- serving'' in downplaying the board's responsibility. ""The authors, whose independence is already in question, were handpicked by Enron's board,'' Dorton said.
     The report said investigators were told ``by more than one person that the company spent considerable time and effort working to say as little as possible'' in documents about transactions with related parties that proved to be Enron's downfall. That ""should have raised red flags for senior management, as well as for Enron's outside auditors and lawyers,'' the report said.
     Hollings said Enron's ties the administration -- Lay was a longtime contributor to Bush's political campaigns and other administration members had business ties to the company - showed the need for a special prosecutor to head the criminal investigation into Enron's collapse.
     ""I've never seen a better example of cash-and-carry government than this Bush administration and Enron,'' Hollings said.
     Bryan Sierra, a spokesman for the Justice Department, refused to comment on Hollings' proposal.

Senate to subpoena Enron's Lay
Lawmakers intent on digging up facts behind Enron's collapse

Sixteen hours before he was to testify under oath, former Enron CEO Ken Lay abruptly cancels his plans to testify before a Senate committee. NBC News correspondent Lisa Myers reports.

By Brock N. Meeks
MSNBC, 02/04/2002

Feb. 4 -  The Senate Commerce Committee will issue a subpoena to compel former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay to appear before the panel, Sen. Byron Dorgan, (D-N.D.), said Monday. The move comes as a direct result of Lay's 11th hour refusal to testify before Congress Monday, raising the ire of lawmakers intent on unearthing the details behind the biggest financial collapse of a single company in U.S. history. Committees in the House also are working on issuing a subpoena to force Lay to appear, sources told MSNBC.com.

       LATE SUNDAY, LAY'S lawyer informed House and Senate committees expecting Lay to testify on Monday that he had changed his mind. 
       ""I have instructed Mr. Lay to withdraw his prior acceptance of your invitation,"" Lay's attorney, Earl Silbert, wrote to committee chairmen. Lay had intended on testifying without any grant of immunity, a move that left defense attorneys scratching their heads, especially in such a potentially inflammatory hearing as Enron.
       It was just that atmosphere, apparently, that moved Lay to withdraw from appearing on Monday.
       ""He [Lay] cannot be expected to participate in a proceeding in which conclusions have been reached before Mr. Lay has been given an opportunity to be heard,"" Silbert wrote.
       ""These inflammatory statements show that judgments have been reached and the tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial,"" wrote Silbert.
       The Senate Commerce Committee, which was to hear Lay's testimony Monday morning, met behind closed doors to discuss issuing the reluctant CEO a subpoena.
       ""We decided that we have really had no choice but to issue a subpoena to require his attendance,"" Dorgan said, ""and we will do that tomorrow at a meeting of the full committee.""
       The Enron issue ""has so many tentacles it's very hard to figure out where to stop and start,"" Dorgan said. ""There are so many questions and we wanted to start with the chairman and CEO Mr. Lay to ask him, what happened, what do you know of what happened and who is accountable and who's responsible. I regret that we weren't given that choice."" 

DIGGING FOR DETAILS
       But the hearings aren't about Lay, insisted Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa. ""It's about the 4,000 people that ""lost their livelihoods, lost their 401(k)s,"" Greenwood told CNBC. Lay and other Enron executives ""need to step up to the microphone and say 'this is what happened, this is the good, the bad and the ugly and make a clean breast of it,"" said Greenwood, who chairs the House Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee. 
Officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the Senate Commerce Committee would convene Tuesday morning - 24 hours after Lay had been scheduled to testify on the largest bankruptcy in the nation's history. 
       But even under subpoena, a witness doesn't have to testify, but merely show up. Once before the Congress, the witness can take advantage of the Fifth Amendment, which protects from self-incrimination. 
       Other key ex-Enron employees are expected on Capitol Hill this week, including former CFO Andrew Fastow. Many of the off-the-books partnerships, in which Enron hid its massive debt from investors and Wall Street, are believed to be the brainchild of Fastow. 
       ""He (Fastow) seems to be the one with the most explaining to do,"" Greenwood said.
       
REPORT DRAWS HARSH WORDS
       An Enron internal inquiry released on Saturday said the company inflated its profits by nearly $1 billion and top employees took in millions of dollars ""they should never have received"" through complex partnerships that played a major role in the company's collapse.
       The results of that Enron investigation released over the weekend were damning and served to fuel the Sunday political talk shows. Lawmakers drew the long knives and wasted no time making their feelings known about the report's findings.
       Sen. Dorgan called Enron ""almost a culture of corporate corruption."" Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., asked whether ""maybe somebody ought to go to the pokey for this.""
       In the aftermath of such verbal blood-letting, it was almost predictable that Lay would bail on his commitment to appear before Congress Monday. 
       In the face of such withering commentary, Lay's attorney wrote in his letter to the committee chairmen that the embattled former CEO ""firmly rejected any allegations that he engaged in wrongful or criminal conduct.""
       On Monday the heat turned up a notch as staffers began drafting subpoenas. 
       ""Even if he takes the Fifth, and that's exactly what we expect, we're going to make him show his face to the American people,"" a congressional aide told MSNBC.com. 
       Enron's internal report ""confirms my initial impression that Enron was essentially operating, this is my opinion, a gigantic pyramid scheme or shell game within the confines of a publicly traded company,"" Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., told CNBC on Monday. 
       Fitzgerald, as a former lawyer for a bank holding company, has special insight into the financial debacle caused by Enron's collapse.
       ""The company was transferring assets back and forth between partnerships,"" Fitzgerald said. ""At one end the company would book a gain, at the other end there would be initially a loss at the partnership, but then the partnership would transfer it back to Enron, then the partnership would book a gain in a different quarter,"" Fitzgerald said, paraphrasing the findings of the company's internal investigation. 
       ""This is an elaborate hoax in my judgment and how this was allowed to go on with a publicly traded company and how? it broke through all our defenses and finally how the SEC didn't detect it is what we've got to figure out,"" Fitzgerald said.
       
ROCKY WEEK AHEAD
       Fastow and one of his lieutenants at Enron, Michael Kopper, are expected to show up later this week to testify, but congressional aides said they are expected to take the Fifth Amendment, too. However, Jeffrey Skilling, another former Enron CEO is expected to testify before the House Oversight subcommittee on Thursday.
       Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., is expected to drop a few bombshells of his own during hearings later in the week.
       He told NBC's Meet the Press that his own committee's investigation tracked what was showing up in Enron's report.
       ""Not only were there corrupt practices,"" Tauzin said. ""Not only was there hiding of the fact that debt was being put off the balance sheets and profits that were reported that didn't exist, but we're finding more than that...what may clearly end up being securities fraud.""
       ""Officers all the way to the board of directors have some responsibility,"" Tauzin said, adding the report even mentioned Ken Lay, the former Enron chairman.
       Houston-based Enron, once the seventh-largest company in America, collapsed in a cloud of debt and questions about its finances and accounting practices. It is under investigation by nine congressional committees, the Justice and Labor departments and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
       ""The tragic consequences of the related-party transactions and accounting errors were the result of many failures at many levels and by many people,"" Enron's internal study says. ""A flawed idea, self-enrichment by employees, inadequately designed controls, poor implementation, inattentive oversight, simple (and not-so-simple) accounting mistakes, and overreaching in a culture that appears to have encouraged pushing the limits.""
       The report's author, Enron Director William Powers, is among those scheduled to testify before Congress in the coming week.
       
ANDERSEN HIRES VOLCKER
       Meanwhile, Andersen, the accounting firm that was Enron's auditor for nine years, challenged the review and called it ""extremely self-serving"" through a spokesman.
       ""The authors of this report, whose independence has already been questioned, were hand-picked by Enron's board,"" said Andersen spokesman Charlie Leonard.
       The accounting firm, under fire for how it handled its oversight of Enron's finances, announced on Sunday it had hired former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to help restore its credibility. The firm also said it would no longer offer some consulting services to some clients.
       ""This is not about window-washing or eye-washing,"" Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino told reporters at a news conference. ""This is not where a report comes in a month later that says nothing. This is about getting answers to what the American public needs from an auditing firm."" 

       The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.


Enron's Lay Faces House Subpoena; Skilling to Appear
2002-02-04 11:31 (New York)
     Washington, Feb. 4 (Bloomberg) -- A House subcommittee chairman says he'll subpoena Former Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth Lay to force him to testify tomorrow.
     Former Enron Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling intends to keep his Thursday appointment with a House committee and he'll answer questions, his spokeswoman Judy Leon said.
     Lay canceled scheduled testimony today and tomorrow, a move his lawyer blamed on lawmakers' ""inflammatory'' comments following the release of an internal company investigation.
     The 203-page review concluded Enron executives enriched themselves while hiding at least $1 billion in losses in 3,000 partnerships, steps that led to the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. The study was commissioned by Enron's board and led by University of Texas Law School Dean William Powers.
     Powers is scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services subcommittee this afternoon, along with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt.
     Lay was scheduled to testify before the same panel tomorrow and before the Senate Commerce Committee today. Representative Richard Baker, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the House Financial Services Capital Markets Subcommittee, will subpoena Lay to make him testify tomorrow, Baker's spokesman Michael DiResto said.

'Culture of Corruption'

     Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan, who was in charge of the Senate hearing, told NBC yesterday that the Powers report shows ""a culture of corporate corruption.'' Dorgan said Lay used reaction to the report to avoid appearing before Congress.
     Republican Senator Peter Fizgerald, a panel member, said the report depicts ``a giant pyramid scheme.'' House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Billy Tauzin spoke of ``security fraud'' on NBC's ``Today'' show.
     ``These inflammatory statements show that judgments have been reached and the tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial,'' Lay's attorney, Earl J. Silbert, said in a letter to the Senate Commerce Committee.
     Former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who the company said earned $30 million from buying and selling company property and assets, is scheduled to appear with Skilling Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce committee. His spokesman refused to comment on any aspect of Fastow's scheduled appearance.

Andersen's Response

     Enron's internal report said the board's audit committee shared in the blame for inadequate disclosures in Enron's public filings, along with management, Arthur Andersen LLP and the company's longtime Houston law firm, Vinson & Elkins.
     Enron lawyer Robert Bennett said the report showed a resolve to find the facts and proved that ""the board was not provided a great deal of information that it should have had.''
     Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton called the report ""self- serving'' in downplaying the board's responsibility. ``The authors, whose independence is already in question, were handpicked by Enron's board,'' Dorton said. ``The authors failed to consult with Andersen in any substantial way.''

'As Little as Possible'

     The report said investigators were told ``by more than one person that the company spent considerable time and effort working to say as little as possible'' in documents about transactions with related parties that proved to be Enron's downfall.
     ""That impulse to avoid public exposure, coupled with the significance of the transactions for Enron's income statements and balance sheets, should have raised red flags for senior management, as well as for Enron's outside auditors and lawyers. Unfortunately, it apparently did not.''
     Lay, a contributor to President George W. Bush, ""bears significant responsibility'' for ""flawed decisions'' in approving some transactions, the report said.
    Enron, once the seventh-largest U.S. corporation, began to unravel in October after it said shareholder equity was reduced by around $1 billion because it used stock to pay off debt of a partnership run by Fastow. The writedown also raised questions about how Enron accounted for debt and losses of similar affiliated partnerships. On Nov. 8, it restated earnings back to 1997, lowering them by $586 million.
     The company filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2 as its stock slid below $1 from more than $80 a year ago and the company was unable to finance its business.

Author of internal Enron report says 'what we found was appalling'

02/04/2002
AFX News
(c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

WASHINGTON (AFX) - Former Enron Corp executives enriched themselves at the failed firm's expense by tens of millions of dollars as they systematically and pervasively misrepresented the group's financial condition, the author of an internal Enron probe told Congress, saying ""What we found was appalling"". 
William Powers, a Dean at the University of Texas Law School who was hired by Enron at the end of October following the company's third quarter 2001 earnings restatements, summarised his findings by saying that the board was also aware that ""the company was seeking to offset its investment losses with its own stock.""
""What we found was appalling,"" Powers told lawmakers in his opening testimony to the House Financial Services Committee at a hearing into Enron's collapse. 
""First, we found that Fastow, and other Enron employees involved in these partnerships, enriched themselves, in the aggregate, by tens of millions of dollars they should never have received,"" Powers charged. 
Andrew Fastow formerly worked for Enron up until last autumn as the company's chief financial officer. 
Powers was hired in October to head up a Special Investigative Committee of the Enron Board of Directors. Powers released his findings in a 218 page report over the weekend. 
The law professor told lawmakers that he found evidence of transactions that were ""improperly structured"" and that he also discovered ""a systematic and pervasive attempt by Enron's management to misrepresent the company's financial condition."" 
""There's no question that virtually everyone, from the board of directors down, understood that the company was seeking to offset its investment losses with its own stock,"" Powers said. 
He said stressed that 70 pct of the failed energy firm's earnings from the third quarter 2000 through to the same period in 2001 ""were not real."" 
""There was misconduct by Fastow and other senior employees of Enron. There were failures in the performance of Enron's outside advisors (Arthur Andersen LLP). And there was a fundamental default of leadership and management,"" Powers added.

Enron Director Faults Managers' 'Misrepresentation'
By Judith Burns

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) top managers, including Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, its senior staff, outside auditors and board of directors all contributed to the company's collapse, one of the company's board members said Monday.
In testimony prepared for delivery to a House Financial Services subcommittee, William Powers, who led an internal investigation into the company's financial crisis, said the probe found ""appalling"" problems at the Houston energy company. 
Powers called Enron's collapse ""a tragedy that could and should have been avoided,"" and blamed it on ""failures at many levels and by many people,"" in and outside the company, including its CEO Lay and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Skilling. 
""We found a systemic and pervasive attempt by Enron's management to misrepresent the company's financial condition,"" Powers said in his testimony. 
A report on the internal investigation was released over the weekend. Powers outlined the main findings in his prepared testimony, focusing on the firm's use of complex, off-the-books partnerships that enriched key employees, including Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
Fastow made ""at least $30 million"" from the partnerships, said Powers. Another Enron employee, Michael Kopper made at least $10 million, and two more made $1 million each, he added. 
Some of the partnerships were improperly structured and didn't follow accounting rules, Powers added. He didn't name the company's outside auditor or attorneys, but said there were ""failures in the performance"" of Enron's outside advisors. 
Rather than hedge Enron's risks, he said the company used the partnerships to avoid recognizing losses on investments. 
""Enron was essentially hedging with itself,"" and deals described as hedging transactions ""weren't real,"" Powers said. In reality, he said only Enron had a real stake in the partnerships and their main assets were Enron's own stock. 
By last March, when the partnerships were unable to make payments, it appeared Enron might have to take a more than $500 million charge to reflect that. Rather than take the hit, Powers said, ""Enron compounded the problem by making even more of its own stock available"" to the partnerships, providing $800 million worth, which resulted in overstating earnings by more than $1 billion. 
""This transaction was apparently hidden from the board and was certainly hidden from the public,"" Powers said. 
As for the partnerships themselves, Powers said ""virtually everyone, from the board of directors on down,"" understood the company was using them to offset investment losses with its own stock. 
""That is not the way it is supposed to work,"" he said. 
Powers faulted the board of directors, saying it ""failed in its duty to provide leadership and oversight.""

Enron Board To Meet Next Monday; Lawsuits Seen Likely
By Christina Cheddar

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) board members will meet again next Monday to consider what their next step will be, according to Thomas Roberts, a partner at Weil Gotshal & Manges, who is advising the board on matters of corporate governance and strategy.
Investigators for a special board committee released Saturday a 211-page report that found Enron inflated its profits by nearly $1 billion, while certain high-ranking employees pocketed millions. 
Board members last met Friday at the offices of Weil Gotshal & Manges in New York to review the report, which was eventually distributed to the bankruptcy court, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and all 12 of the Congressional Committees investigating Enron. 
Next, the report will be reviewed with Enron's creditors committee and possible courses of action will be discussed, Roberts said. 
Although highly critical of what it sees as questionable practices by management and its auditors, the report doesn't allege criminal activity. The investigation's scope was limited to studying Enron's related-party transactions. 
A person familiar with the board said the directors could request further, follow-up investigations that might address other outstanding issues. 
This person also said it is likely Enron's board will file numerous civil suits against ""third parties"" identified as having contributed to Enron's financial collapse. 
The list could cut across of wide swath of former Enron employees, and may even include outside consultants such as Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP. 
In response to the results of the internal probe, Andersen issued a written response Saturday that called the investigation ""an attempt to insulate (Enron's) leadership and the board of directors from criticism by shifting blame to others."" 
Enron's longtime legal advisers, Vinson & Elkins, also were criticized by the report for not providing a ""more objective and critical voice."" 
Officials from the Washington, D.C., law firm have not returned repeated phone calls requesting a comment.

USA: Ex-Enron CEO Skilling still plans to testify.

02/04/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - One-time Enron Corp. Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling still plans to testify before a congressional committee later this week, his spokeswoman said on Monday, unlike other former executives of the fallen energy giant. 
""Mr. Skilling plans to testify,"" Judy Leon, his spokeswoman, said. When asked if he would invoke his constitutional right not to testify when he appears before a House panel on Thursday, she said ""No.""
He resigned as president and chief executive from Enron on Aug. 14, 2001, citing personal reasons. 
Skilling, along with former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and Chief Accounting Officer Richard Causey, are slated to go before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations on Thursday. 
Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the full Energy and Commerce Committee, said on Sunday he expected Fastow and another former Enron executive, Michael Kopper, to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights not to testify at the hearing. 
Former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay abruptly canceled his planned appearances before a Senate Commerce subcommittee on Monday and House Financial Services hearing on Tuesday because of what his lawyer described as a prosecutorial atmosphere in Congress. 
That decision also followed the release of a damaging report over the weekend by a special committee of Enron's board of directors that blasted Lay for his lack of oversight.

Former Enron chief Kenneth Lay appears to have substantial assets at his disposal

HOUSTON (AP) - If former Enron Corp. chief executive Kenneth Lay is fighting to stave off personal bankruptcy, as his wife says, he appears to have a lot of assets at his disposal. 
Two Houston homes and four adjoining apartments in the city have a combined value of $1.1 million. Three beachfront homes and two lots on the west end of Galveston are valued at a combined $1.7 million. Four properties in exclusive Aspen, Colo., could fetch more than $19 million.
Linda Lay said last week on NBC's ""Today"" show that she and her husband lost their fortune when Enron crashed because most of it was tied up in shares now each worth less than a cup of coffee. 
She said all their homes are up for sale except the $7.1 million 33rd floor of one of Houston's most exclusive high-rises. 
""We're fighting for liquidity,"" she said. 
But if the Houston and Galveston properties are on the market, many real estate agents do not know about it. 
A red-brick two-story house in Houston, formerly owned by the Lays and valued at $259,300, was sold within the past two months. But the two other homes and four adjoining apartments do not have for-sale signs and are not listed on the Internet through the Houston Realtors Association. Nor are the Galveston properties. 
Pamela Hughes, spokeswoman for the Galveston Association of Realtors, said they could still be for sale. She said sellers sometimes ask that listings not be published and that for-sale signs not be placed in front of properties while sales are negotiated privately. 
Three of the Lays' properties in Aspen are listed, and the sale of a fourth in the winter playground is being negotiated privately, said broker Joshua Saslove. 
A five-bedroom home and a four-bedroom home in Aspen were each initially listed for $6.5 million, but the five-bedroom has been reduced to $6.15 million and the smaller dwelling is on the market for $6.125 million, Saslove said. An undeveloped lot is listed for $2.95 million. 
The Lays' smallest Aspen home, a three-bedroom cottage valued at $4.1 million, is also for sale, but less conspicuously. 
""We are negotiating privately with an individual to acquire it,"" Saslove said of the smaller home. ""It is under contract."" 
Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Lay received about $8.3 million in salary and bonuses from Enron in 2000. Other records show he sold 1.8 million shares of Enron stock for $101 million from October 1998 through November of last year. 
His lawyer, Earl Silbert, did not return a call for comment on the sale of Lay's real estate holdings. Silbert said last month that Lay sold millions of dollars in stock because he needed cash to repay loans, not out of concern over the company's health. 
Silbert said Lay put up stock as collateral for other investments. At least 15 times from February to October last year, Lay returned Enron shares to the company to repay $4 million he had received through a credit line. 
Records show that through December, when Lay resigned from the boards of Compaq Computer Corp. and Eli Lilly & Co., he directly owned $6.7 million in stock in those companies. After his resignations from the boards, he was no longer required to disclose his holdings in those companies. 
His Enron stock, valued at $1.1 million through December, was worth less than the beachfront properties. Lay resigned as chairman and chief executive of Enron on Jan. 23 but remains on the board. 
The Lays do not have to worry about losing their penthouse. Texas law guarantees that debtors can keep a primary residence while in bankruptcy, whether it is or a one-room efficiency apartment or a multimillion-dollar mansion.

US Senate Panel Chmn Calls For Enron Special Prosecutor
By Bryan Lee

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., called Monday for a special prosecutor to investigate what he called a ""culture of government corruption"" surrounding the influence of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) on the Bush administration. 
Hollings characterized the extensive ties of Bush administration officials to Enron as an example of ""cash and carry"" government.
Among those with Enron ties cited by Hollings were Lawrence Lindsey, White House economic adviser; Mitch Daniels, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Trade Representative Robert Zoellick; Secretary of the Army Thomas White; and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt, who as a private sector attorney, represented Arthur Andersen (X.AND), Enron's outside auditor. 
Hollings also cited Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Pat Wood III as ""Enron's man,"" and cited Enron's lobbyist Marc Racicot, chairman of the Republican National Committee. Racicot was formerly governor of Montana. 
""I think we ought to have a special prosecutor,"" Hollings said at a press conference where the committee he chairs announced it would meet Tuesday and vote to subpoena former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay to testify before the panel Feb. 12. 
Hollings also cited the energy policy task force, headed by Vice President Dick Cheney, as an example of Enron's influence on the administration. Cheney and administration officials were lobbying on behalf of Enron's interests in states such as California, he said, complaining that at the time Cheney wouldn't take calls from Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., even as Cheney met with Enron officials at least six times.

Enron Internal Report May Give Creditors Legal Grist
By Kathy Chu

02/04/2002
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- An internal report into bankrupt Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) off-balance-sheet partnerships is expected to provide grist for creditors to take legal action.
The report, which details the actions of Enron executives, its auditors and the company's outside counsel in the partnerships, could lead to expanded class-action lawsuits naming additional defendants, according to bankruptcy experts. 
""Considerations will include, who do you sue, and at what level do you go down?"" said Bruce A. Markell, a professor at University of Nevada, Las Vegas' law school. 
The litigation will also depend upon the extent of liability coverage that Enron executives have under existing insurance policies, according to Markell. 
Enron has said that it holds an $85 million fiduciary policy, which provides for an additional $10 million in defense costs, and a separate liability policy of $350 million for directors and officers. 
Currently, 29 Enron executives - including former Chairman Kenneth Lay, former Chief Executive Andrew Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow - have been named in shareholder class-action lawsuits that are before Federal District Court Judge Melinda Harmon in Houston. 
If these suits are amended, which is likely to happen after a lead plaintiff has been named, more defendants could be named. Among the possibilities are former Enron employees Kristina Mordaunt, once an in-house lawyer, as well as Kathy Lynn and Anne Yaeger Patel, both of the finance department. 
The internal report named these three as among those who may have violated Enron's Code of Conduct by receiving compensation from both Enron and an off-balance-sheet partnership. 
Others implicated in the report, including those already the target of shareholder litigation, are Andrew Fastow; Michael Kopper, who once reported to Fastow, and Ben Glisan, current Enron treasurer. 
Also, Ken Lay held ""ultimate responsibility for taking reasonable steps to ensure that the officers reporting to him performed their oversight duties properly,"" according to the internal investigation. ""Ultimately, a large measure of the responsibility rests with the (then-)CEO."" 
Two days after its release, the report is giving some creditors impetus to join the movement to appoint an independent party to manage Enron's bankruptcy case. 
""We believe that having reviewed the special committee's report - as limited as it may be - it is clear that current management and the board, excluding those who joined the company recently, clearly have no business running a publicly traded company,"" said Andrew Entwistle, an attorney for the Florida State Board of Compensation, which lost $334 million in Enron-related investments. 
The state pension fund plans to file a motion in the next week asking that a trustee be named to take over Enron's daily operations. This would be a severely disruptive move, but is one of the remedies that Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the Bankruptcy Court of New York, could employ in a case that includes ""fraud, dishonesty, incompetence or gross mismanagement,"" as specified by the bankruptcy code. 
But the more likely, and less disruptive, choice is for the judge to name an examiner to investigate certain aspects of Enron's business in order to determine whether misdeeds occurred. 
If this happens, more information could come out about the partnerships as well as about allegations of insider trading and mishandling of employees' pension funds by Enron executives - aspects that weren't covered by the internal investigation. 
""There's a large amount of concern that it's business as usual at Enron,"" said John Nabors, who represents Exco Resources Inc. (EXCO), an Enron creditor. ""(Enron) seems to have a corporate culture that all the rules don't apply."" 
In the next few weeks, Exco also plans to ask the bankruptcy court to name a trustee or examiner in Enron's case - joining a half-dozen energy concerns that have already filed similar requests.

USA: UPDATE 1-AFL-CIO asks SEC bar Enron directors from boards.
By Kevin Drawbaugh

02/04/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The AFL-CIO called on U.S. regulators on Monday to bar directors of Enron Corp. from serving on other companies' boards, arguing the directors were ""substantially unfit"" for such duties. 
Focusing on corporate governance issues dear to unions, the U.S. labor federation released a letter it wrote to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt citing ""imminent danger to workers' retirement savings.""
""The SEC must now investigate the role of each individual Enron director in the company's collapse and move to bar those responsible from other boards,"" AFL-CIO Secretary Treasurer Richard Trumka said in a statement. 
The 66-union federation called for bans on all directors of Houston-based Enron except recently appointed William Powers and Raymond Troubh. Powers and Troubh were two of the co-authors of an internal inquiry report released on Saturday that examined the collapse of the former energy trading giant. 
The third co-author, Herbert Winokur, was among 10 Enron directors who should be barred from boards on which they serve, including Owens Corning , Comdisco Inc. , Motorola Inc. , ImClone Systems Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. , the AFL-CIO said. 
""In our view, the fundamental failures of the Enron directors to exercise their legal mandate to protect the interests of Enron shareholders demonstrates the Enron directors' substantial unfitness to serve as an officer or director,"" Trumka wrote in the letter to Pitt. 
SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan declined to comment. ""We haven't had a chance to see the letter yet,"" she said. 
The AFL-CIO said the SEC has the power to ask a court to issue a ""substantial unfitness bar order"" against directors. 
Spokespersons for the directors of Enron could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The internal report released on Saturday, known as the Powers Report, faulted Enron's directors for not paying closer attention to questionable financial dealings that led Enron on Dec. 2 to file the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
The AFL-CIO, along with the British Trades Union Congress, called on Britain's Institute of Chartered Accountants to probe whether Lord John Wakeham breached professional and ethical standards in his role as an Enron director. 
Wakeham said last week he was stepping aside temporarily as chairman of Britain's Press Complaints Commission to answer questions about his links to Enron. 
Trades Union Congress General Secretary John Monks said, ""As a member of (Enron's) audit and compliance committee, Lord Wakeham has some very hard questions to answer. The ICA must ask whether its rules and standards were breached."" 
In addition to Winokur and Wakeham, other Enron directors named by the AFL-CIO in its request included Robert Belfer, Ronnie Chan, John Duncan, Wendy Gramm, Robert Jaedicke, former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, John Mendelsohn and Frank Savage.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Puts Broadband Assets Up For Sale
By Michael Rieke
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

02/04/2002
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) next big thing is the latest group of assets the company has put up for sale. 
Last month, Enron distributed a CD-ROM listing the telecommunications assets it is selling. Assets include fiber-optic data-transmission networks, telecom real estate and a few warehouses full of telecom equipment.
A spokesman for Enron said he didn't know how much the company had invested in the broadband assets. An analyst said Enron spent $800 million to $900 million on the network. 
Now that Enron's in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, how much can its creditors expect to get from the sale? ""Whatever the market will bear,"" said the Enron spokesman. 
Some would say it's a buyer's market...if there were any buyers. 
One of the highest profile broadband network companies, Global Crossing Ltd. (GX), filed last week for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the biggest telecom bankruptcy in history. 
Global Crossing has lots of company under the umbrella of bankruptcy court protection. McLeodUSA Inc. (MCLD) also filed for Chapter 11 protection last week, joining Winstar Communications, 360networks Inc. (T.TSX) and others. 
Level 3 Communications Inc. (LVLT) could be the next telecom company showing up at a bankruptcy court, some observers say. 
Williams Communications Group (WCG), which has finished constructing its network, isn't going to be in the buyers pool either. Besides, like many other telecom carriers, Williams needs just about every penny it has to pay interest on its high-debt load. 
That is too bad because some of Enron's assets could go for pennies on the dollar. 

Dark Fiber Market Already Saturated 

The dark fiber market is already crowded. Dark fiber isn't operational because it isn't connected to the equipment that sends and receives data. It costs millions of dollars to lay fiber, but it costs 10 to fifteen times more to buy and install the equipment to light it. 
A report by Merrill Lynch last year said that less than 5% of the fiber in the ground is lit. There are thousands of miles of dark fiber, because there is an excess of lit capacity. 
Enron knows that. It was the biggest market-maker in bandwidth trading last year. It quoted prices to buy and sell circuits from DS3 to OC48, linking cities in the U.S., as well as cities around the globe. 
During 2001, quoted prices dropped 90% or more. Those quotes are questionable because they mostly originated from Enron traders or traders at other companies that were trying to create a market for trading bandwidth. 
Telecom companies often said the quotes were too low, because no company was actually delivering working circuits at those prices. Enron now can only hope the telecom companies were right. 
Enron's metro fiber - what is known as the last mile in the telecom sector - might draw interest from buyers. While there is an excess of longhaul fiber between cities, there is a shortage of connectivity in metropolitan areas. 
Enron's sales material says it has dark fiber in metro areas like Atlanta, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and New York. It doesn't, however, give enough detail about the routes, buildings and facilities that the fiber links. Such information is available on request, according to Enron. 
The value of the metro fiber depends on who laid the fiber and with whom the fiber interconnects, said a source who deals in telecom assets. Buyers will be put off by the fact that some of Enron's fiber was bought from now bankrupt carriers. 
Turning to operational assets, Enron says it is selling ""a world-class IP network designed for high quality, high bandwidth delivery and applications services."" 

'World-Class' Sometimes A Misnomer 

In the telecom sector, ""world-class"" doesn't necessarily mean the network works, said a former Enron Broadband Services executive. Despite such claims by telecom carriers, they all have quality problems, including Enron, he said. 
Enron's record with prospective network customers certainly isn't an endorsement of its quality. Blockbuster Inc. (BBI) backed out of its video-on-demand deal with Enron, saying Enron's network had too many glitches. Enron and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are in litigation regarding a deal for the EBS network to carry MSN's latest high-speed broadband services. 
A number of former Enron telecom technicians say the construction of the company's networks was hampered by its financial accounting. In order to keep expenses down, equipment wasn't installed on a circuit unless the circuit could generate revenue. 
That approach sounds economical, except for the fact that Enron already had bought thousands of pieces of equipment. 
Although the Enron spokesman said he thinks it is all new equipment, it is more likely to be unused rather than new. Since Enron started drastically cutting its broadband expenditures last summer, it probably hasn't been buying equipment lately. 
Telecom technicians who looked at the equipment list said that a lot of it is at least two to three years old. Much of it had a useful life of 18 months, said one technician. 
Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) might be a prospective buyer for some equipment. Last year, the equipment maker was reported to be buying Cisco brand equipment from liquidators who had acquired it from bankrupt companies. Cisco reportedly destroyed the equipment to keep it from competing in the marketplace with new equipment. 
A cover letter accompanied the CD-ROM of telecom assets Enron sent to prospective buyers last month. The letter asked that buyers indicate their interest by Jan. 24. But the company was still sending the information to possible buyers last week. 
If you are looking for a broadband bargain, give Enron a call.

Petrobras Pres: Co Will Only Seek Enron Assets In Courts

02/04/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The president of federally controlled Brazilian oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR) said Monday his company is interested in Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) assets in Brazil, but would only seek to acquire them through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings involving the failed energy trading company's assets. 
Francisco Gros told reporters after a Brazilian-American Chamber of Commerce conference that Enron has ""high-quality assets in Latin America.""
Talks have stalled over Petrobras' acquisition of Enron's stakes in two Brazilian utilities, locally known as CEC and CEG-Rio. 
Gros dismissed concerns that Enron's involvement in the Bolivia-Brazil natural gas pipeline, through which about only 12 million cubic feet of natural gas a day are transported into Brazil, could be disrupted by the problems surrounding Enron, which has a large stake in the project, especially on the Bolivian side. 
Gros also said Petrobras, as Brazil's oil giant is known, doesn't have any specific debt issues in the works. But Gros said the company would continue to access capital markets, depending on market conditions. ""Right now, today, there is no specific issue"" underway. 
On yet another front, the Petrobras president said his main concern about Brazil's October presidential elections is that the candidates might not fully appreciate the global nature of media coverage when delivering their campaign speeches. He said foreign investors will pay attention to what is said, and they are ""paid to worry."" 
While he expressed confidence in the strength of Brazil's institutional framework, Gros suggested that reckless campaign speeches could make the management of Brazil's fiscal balances more difficult for any party that wins the election. 
Leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the opposition Workers Party is leading in polls, while the official candidate, Jose Serra, is trailing badly in the polls.

Accounting worries slam stocks
Dow plummets 220, Nasdaq 56 amid bookkeeping worries

By Roland Jones
MSNBC


Feb. 4 - The major market averages finished sharply lower Monday, with the Dow industrials falling over 200 points, as a new batch of revelations about accounting standards at U.S. firms soured the mood on Wall Street.

       THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE closed Monday's session down about 220 points, or 2 percent, after finishing Friday 13 points lower at 9,907. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed down around 56 points, or 3 percent. It finished Friday 23 points lower at 1,911.
       Worrying revelations about the accounting practices of firms like Tyco International and Global Crossing revived investors' concerns about corporate bookkeeping practices Monday, sending stock prices sharply lower.
       Market analysts said Wall Street is struggling with ""Enronitis,"" the fallout from energy trading giant Enron's accounting shenanigans that led to its record bankruptcy filing last December and cast a pall over the rest of the market.
       Last week, investors sold off stocks as concern grew about accounting structures at firms like Tyco, Williams Companies and Cendant. Wall Street worried that bad accounting practices at these firms might lead to more Enron-style bankruptcies. 
       ""The Enron disease is still spreading and it's hitting more companies,"" said Ned Riley of State Street Global Advisors, speaking on CNBC. Riley added that he thinks the fallout from the Enron debacle is likely to pose a problem the stock market for some time.
       Meanwhile, in Washington the Senate Commerce Committee said it plans to issue a subpoena to compel former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay to appear before the panel. On Sunday, Lay cancelled this week's scheduled testimony because of what his attorney called an increasingly ""prosecutorial"" climate. An internal investigation issued over the weekend found Enron collapsed because of massive failures by its management, board and outside advisers. 
       The report said the conglomerate spent about $8 billion in its past three fiscal years on over 700 acquisitions that were never publicly announced. Tyco's stock price, which was crushed last week because of questions about the firm's accounting practices, fell 12 percent. 
       Also worrying Wall Street was Global Crossing's announcement that it will appoint a special committee of independent directors to conduct a review of accounting-related allegations. The telecom firm filed for bankruptcy protection last week and its accounting methods are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
       Network equipment maker Enterasys Networks, another firm under investigation by the SEC, saw its share price plunge 60 percent as analysts downgraded its stock after the company warned of disappointing quarterly revenues. After Friday's close, Enterasys said it had discovered accounting irregularities in its Asian operations. 
       Monday's earnings news failed to calm investors. Shares of computer and printer maker Hewlett-Packard pared early gains and was flat after the firm said its earnings in the quarter ended Jan. 31 will substantially exceed Wall Street's forecast. Shares Compaq Computer, which has proposed to merge with Hewlett-Packard but faces shareholder opposition, also slipped.
       In other earnings news, home improvement retailer Lowe's said its fourth-quarter earnings would top an earlier forecast. And Internet commerce firm Priceline.com reported a fourth-quarter profit versus a year-ago loss. Priceline's shares slid 21 percent.
       Also, Elan's stock price slumped 52 percent after the Irish pharmaceutical company warned that 2002 financial results will fall short of expectations. Its shares came under pressure last week on concerns about the firm's accounting practices. 
       On the Dow, financial issues like J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and American Express fell sharply, reflecting investors' doubts about the timing of an economic recovery. General Electric, a Dow stock with a complicated accounting structure, saw its share price fall 5 percent on concerns its accounting practices might not be up to par.
       Also Monday, President Bush sent Congress a $2.13 trillion budget Monday that provides billions of dollars in new spending for the war on terrorism and homeland security.
       And telecom shares slid after a handful of companies reported bad news. Shares of Williams Communications Group fell 29 percent after its banks warned that it may be in default under its credit agreement. And concerns about WorldCom's debt ratings sent its shares price down 16 percent.
       Fourth-quarter earnings season, which has been the worst in over a decade, moves into lower gear this week. A few big-name firms are slated to report their earnings scorecards, including Web gear maker Cisco Systems.
       Stocks finished Friday with modest losses, as cautious investors took profits from a strong two-day advance on Wednesday and Thursday amid concerns about the timing and strength of an economic recovery.
       Most international stock markets lost ground Monday. The main European bourses ended lower, and Tokyo stocks fell after Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's first policy speech of 2002 failed to convince investors he can push through economic reforms. 
       The benchmark Nikkei 225-share average finished Monday down 160 points, or 1.63 percent, after dropping 2.1 percent Friday. 
       Bonds rose. The 10-year Treasury note was up 19/32 point, and its yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 4.91 percent. The 30-year bond was up 21/32 point, yielding 5.35 percent.
       The dollar lost ground, trading at 87.02 cents to the euro and 132.29 yen to the dollar, compared with 86.19 cents and 133.15 yen late Friday in New York.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron third-quarter earnings rise.

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Tuesday its third-quarter earnings rose as its core wholesale marketing and trading division delivered strong returns. 
The company said earnings rose to $393 million, or 43 cents per share, from $292 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier. The company reported a share loss of 84 cents after $1.01 billion of nonrecurring charges.
""After a thorough review of our businesses, we have decided to take these charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energybusinesses,"" said Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman and chif executive officer. 
Enron's non-recurring charges included $287 million related to the write-down of its troubled water venture, Azurix, as well as $544 million writedown related to various investments including its retail electricity provider New Power Co. and $180 million related to restructuring of its broadband operations. 
Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected earnings of 42 cents to 45 cents per share, with a mean estimate of 43 cents. 
The results met expectations for a rocky quarter that included the surprise departure of President and Chief Executive Jeff Skilling in August, after just six months at the helm. 
Enron shares closed on Monday at $33.17, down $2.64 or 7.3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. So far this year, the stock has fallen some 60 percent, far worse than the 25 percent loss of the Standard & Poor's utilities index .

Enron Has Loss of 84 Cents a Share in Third Quarter (Update2)

     (Adds profit excluding charges in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, said it had a third-quarter loss after taking
$1.01 billion in charges for restructuring, investment losses, and
the planned sale of a water business.

     The loss was $618 million, or 84 cents a share after
preferred-dividend payments, Houston-based Enron said in a
statement. A year earlier, Enron had net income of $292 million,
or 34 cents. Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion from
$30 billion.

     The charges totaled $1.11 a share. They included $287 million
for asset impairments by water company Azurix Corp., $180 million
to restructure the company's unit that trades fiber-optic
bandwidth and $544 million for losses on investments including New
Power Co., a retail energy-sales venture.

     Excluding the charges, Enron said it would have earned
$393 million, or 43 cents a share. That matched the average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.

     Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in the

OUTLOOK Enron Q3 EPS 43 cents vs 34

10/16/2001

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp is expected to report later today third-quarter earnings per share of 43 cents, compared with 34 cents a year earlier, according to the First Call/Thomson Financial consensus of 17 brokers. 
The integrated energy company is expected to meet near-consensus results driven by its wholesale services division, analysts said.
Montgomery Securities analyst Daniel Tulis is calculating third-quarter EPS of 42 cents, 1 cent below consensus. 
Full-year EPS stands at 1.85. 
Enron's third quarter was marked by the unexpected departure of chief executive Jeff Skilling, for personal reasons, with Chairman Ken Lay reassuming the key position. 
Lay is likely to remain in the position until it is filled within 12-18 months, Tulis said. 
The company remains embroiled in arbitration proceedings in India after its 2.9 bln usd Dabhol power plant in India was closed. The plant's sole client, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), failed - and later refused - to pay bills that now total about 45 mln usd.

Reliant Hires Merrill to Find Buyer for Dutch Power Producer

Reliant Hires Merrill to Find Buyer for Dutch Power Producer

     Amsterdam, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Reliant Energy Inc., the
owner of Houston's utility, said it hired Merrill Lynch & Co. to
find a buyer for its Dutch power-generation business, two years
after acquiring the company from the government for $2.3 billion.

     Reliant has already been approached by possible buyers, said
Clyde Moerlie, a spokesman for Reliant Energy Europe. The unit,
which doesn't have any household customers, earned $9 million in
the second quarter compared with $26 million a year earlier.

     The U.S. company may struggle to get the price it paid for
the Utrecht-based unit, formerly known as UNA, analysts said, on
expectations heightened competition will erode profit further and
as utilities increasingly seek customers as well as power plants.

     In the Dutch generation market, ``there aren't many
opportunities, but prices will fall to much lower levels as
growing competition pushes down tariffs,'' said Steven de Proost,
an analyst at Delta Lloyd Securities in Antwerp.

     Houston-based Reliant paid 2.9 times sales for UNA in 1999,
while Electrabel SA, Belgium's dominant power provider, paid 2.7
times sales for Epon, the biggest utility in the Netherlands. E.ON
AG of Germany paid 1.6 times sales the same year for the generator
NV Electriciteitsbedrijf Zuid-Holland, or EZH.

     Reliant joins rivals TXU Corp. and Edison International in
reassessing its European business amid disappointing earnings.
Reliant in July tied the second-quarter profit drop in Europe to
increased competition and falling margins in the Dutch market.

                            Enron Cuts

     Enron Corp. said last week it will cut 10 percent of its
European workforce, while Edison Mission Energy agreed to sell two
U.K. power plants to American Electric Power Co. on Monday.

     The U.S. utility said last month it was considering a sale of
the Dutch business after it was contacted ``by a number of parties
who have expressed an interest'' in its European assets, and as it
reallocates capital to fulfill ``growth objectives.''

     Merrill already advised the Dutch state on the original sale
of UNA to Reliant, the only time a U.S. company has taken control
of a continental European utility. This year, Merrill ranks sixth
in advising on transactions involving a European utilities target,
with $6.9 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions.

     Potential buyers for UNA, which provides about 20 percent of
the Netherlands' electricity, are likely to be companies already
present in the Dutch market, such as Nuon NV, Eneco, or Spain's
Endesa SA, analysts said. UNA may also attract generation
companies including Mirant Corp. and International Power Plc.

     Atlanta-based Mirant and International Power predecessor
National Power Plc both bid for UNA when it was first put up for
sale. Central and Northern Europe are ``areas we're interested
in,'' said Aarti Singhal, an International Power spokeswoman.

     ``We're looking at all options,'' said Fransce Verdeuzeldonk,
a spokeswoman for Nuon, in an interview.

                         Spanish Interest

     Endesa, Spain's largest power producer, agreed to buy Remu
NV, the No. 4 electric utility in the Netherlands, for 1.5 billion
euros last December. The completion of the transaction has been
held up by the Dutch government, which wants at least 51 percent
of utility company shares to remain in the hands of public
authorities until at least 2004.

     An Endesa spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the
company would be interested in UNA. Endesa said in July its
purchase of an Italian generator was enough to meet its goal of
having 8,000 megawatts of capacity in Europe outside Spain.

     Based in Utrecht in central Netherlands, UNA is one of the
four main power generation companies in Holland, operating six
power plants. It had 1998 sales of about $800 million and is one
of the only generation companies in the market up for grabs.

     Germany's E.ON owns EZH, Belgium's Electrabel controls Epon,
while EPZ, another big power producer, is owned by Essent NV.




India: IDBI signals SOS for Rs 3,000-cr equity

10/16/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Fin. Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire. Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd

NEW DELHI, Oct. 15. INDUSTRIAL Development Bank of India (IDBI), the country's largest development financial institution, appears to be heading for some serious trouble. 
A revised set of figures placed by the institution to the Ministry of Finance has indicated a cash requirement of Rs 7,000 crore over the next three years, much of which it is finding difficult to tie up. Besides, it has also placed a request for a Rs 3,000-crore equity infusion from the Government.
The revised financial projections were placed before the Finance Ministry last week by an IDBI team headed by the Chairman, Mr P.P. Vora. The meeting was attended by the Advisor, Ministry of Finance, Dr Rakesh Mohan, the Additional Secretary, Capital Markets Division, Mr S.K. 
Purakayastha, and the Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Mr G.P. Muniappan. 
At a meeting on October 5, IDBI had placed its capital infusion requirement at Rs 2,500 crore and immediate fund requirement at about Rs 5,500 crore. 
Officials have been particularly concerned over IDBI's admission that it has been struggling to raise resources from the market due to the rating downgrade in August despite its massive requirements. It has also admitted to the Ministry that it may be heading for losses during the current fiscal. According to sources, the institution has admitted that the losses could spill over to the subsequent year unless assistance comes at an appropriate time. 
IDBI has said the capital infusion of Rs 3,000 crore is being sought to write off a portion of the institution's huge portfolio of non-performing assets (NPAs), which at the end of fiscal 2000-01 stood at over Rs 9,000 crore in gross terms. 
The institution has argued that only a massive NPA write-off would enable it to get back its rating, thereby allowing it to tie up the funds requirement from the market. IDBI's rating was downgraded by Crisil from AAA to AA+ recently. 
IDBI, which was directed by the Government to submit a three-year cash flow statement during the October 5 meeting, has said the additional cash requirement for the three years alone stands at Rs 7,000 crore. 
Of the cash requirement, the immediate need includes a Rs 2,200-crore repayment arising out of the institution's decision to exercise the call option on its earlier bonds series. The repayment would be due in March 2002. 
Moreover, the institution also wants to keep itself ready in the event that Enron, the promoters of Dabhol Power Company, invokes its guarantee of about Rs 1,800 crore.

INDIA: Tata Power Q2 net up 74 pct, beats f'cast.

10/16/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Tata Power Company, India's largest private utility, on Tuesday reported net profit for the July-September quarter rose 74 percent over a year earlier, far above analysts' expectations. 
The company, which is negotiating to buy Enron Corp's stake in a troubled Indian unit, said net profit rose to 2.42 billion rupees ($50.42 million) from 1.39 billion a year earlier on sales that rose 17.54 percent to 10.99 billion rupees.
The performance was boosted by a profit of 660 million rupees from sale of long term investments in the quarter, against 210 million a year earlier. 
A Reuters poll of 14 brokerages released last week forecast net profit for the quarter would drop to a median 1.27 billion rupees from a year earlier, on an 8.45 percent rise in sales to 10.11 billion rupees. 
Tata Power generates thermal and hydro-electric power, and distributes electricity across the western state of Maharashtra, including its capital Bombay. 
Ahead of the results, its shares closed down 0.62 percent at 96.65 rupees while the Bombay benchmark index ended 0.54 percent higher. (US$1=47.99 Indian rupees).

I talked to Chris about the Texas opportunity and he seemed interested.  He still wanted to talk to Scott Neal about a potential cash trading role on the East desk.  In the same breath he said that he welcomed an opportunity that had some commercial aspects but did not require running a book (which the East desk job would probably require).  I believe he is hesitant to leave the East environment because he is so familiar with it.  He said he will let me know on Monday morning.

USA: Congressional panel to issue 51 subpoenas on Enron.
By Kevin Drawbaugh

01/09/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Fifty-one subpoenas seeking documents on the collapse of Enron Corp. will be issued on Friday by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the committee told Reuters on Wednesday. 
Marking a further escalation of the Enron saga, the document subpoenas were thought to be the first to come out of Congress, although federal agents have already invoked their subpoena power to compel testimony on Enron.
""We are issuing subpoenas on Friday. There are 51 subpoenas being issued,"" a spokesperson for the subcommittee said. 
Subpoenas will be served on Enron, the fallen energy trading giant, and its auditor, the accounting firm Andersen, as well as 49 individual officers, employees, and members of Enron's board of directors, the spokesperson said. 
Robert Bennett, a lawyer representing Enron on Capitol Hill, said he was aware of the subpoena plan. He said Enron was ""fully cooperating"" with the subcommittee. 
""Not only am I aware of this, I told them a week ago they didn't need to issue subpoenas, that we'd be happy to produce whatever documents they want,"" Bennett said in an interview. 
""I don't think it was at all necessary to issue subpoenas. I also told them, and they agreed, that I will accept service of these subpoenas. So, they're just going to send them to me."" 
Last week, the subcommittee joined four other congressional panels, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the departments of Justice and Labor in probing Enron. 
Once the world's largest energy trading firm, the company went in a few short weeks from Wall Street star to making the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history on Dec. 2. 
Its downfall threw thousands out of work and destroyed billions of dollars in investor equity, even as top Enron executives allegedly raked in fat profits by selling shares ahead of a dizzying drop in the company's stock pri???hares were trading at 80 cents on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, off an Aug. 2000 high of???RINGS GALORE 
Another congressional hearing into Enron is scheduled for Jan. 24 before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, of which the permanent subcommittee is a part. The two are pursuing separate lines of inquiry, the spokesperson said. 
""The subcommittee is looking into the role of the officers and board members, the role of the auditors, and the role of special-purpose entities,"" or the financial partnerships set up by Enron to keep certain debts off its books, the spokesperson said. 
These topics closely resemble those being probed by the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee, which have already held hearings, as well as the House and Senate Energy committees. 
The subcommittee spokesperson said: ""We are subpoenaing documents. We're not subpoenaing people to come forward ... We are subpoenaing, not because people are refusing to turn over, it's just the most efficient method to get documents."" 
Last month, former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow complied with a subpoena and testified before the SEC after the agency threatened to slap him with a court order. 
The subcommittee did not name the 49 individuals who will be served with subpoenas, but congression???embers of Enron's large board of directors. 
Enron, Andersen, and the 49 individuals would have ""several weeks"" to respond to the subpoenas, the spokesperson said.

USA: Judge rules she has power to freeze Enron assets.

01/09/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

HOUSTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - A federal judge ruled she has the authority to freeze $1.1 billion in assets belonging to Enron Corp. executives but postponed a decision on the measure sought by a bank that is suing the bankrupt energy trader. 
In an order dated Jan. 8, U.S. District Court Judge Lee Rosenthal asked Amalgamated Bank, which manages worker retirement funds, to file a brief in support of its request by Jan. 23 and Enron and its executives to file a response by Feb. 6.
Rosenthal said a 1999 Supreme Court opinion cited in the case did not prevent her from freezing the assets of 29 Enron executives and board members named in the suit. 
But she said there were insufficient grounds for issuing such an order immediately. 
Amalgamated Bank has alleged that Enron executives and board members pocketed $1.1 billion from sales of Enron stock in recent years by artificially inflating earnings to jack up the price. 
Amalgamated attorney Bill Lerach told Rosenthal in December that his clients lost more than $10 million from the collapse of Enron and that they hoped to get some of it back from the wealthy Enron executives. 
Rosenthal argued at the time that freezing the money would help his clients and those in an estimated 60 other shareholder lawsuits recover their losses. 
Attorneys for the Enron executives said their clients had not done anything wrong and that an a???necessary.

Enron's once-wild trading ways could be curbed by new partner
By BRAD FOSS
AP Business Writer

01/09/2002
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW YORK - If an investment bank is picked this week to help revive Enron Corp.'s core energy trading business, a conservative turn is expected for an operation built on aggressive risk-taking and high volume. 
An auction of Enron's trading operation is scheduled Thursday in federal bankruptcy court, where the Houston-based company wound up when its financial problems spun out of control in November.
Before its collapse, the company was the world's largest energy merchant, accounting for roughly 25 percent of all trades in a market it helped pioneer. Enron differed from competitors in its penchant for complex bets on everything under the sun - advertising space, broadband, paper, the weather and more than 1,000 other products. 
Investment banks that appear to have an interest in buying into Enron, such as Citigroup Inc. and UBS Warburg, would likely shed the gun-slinging attitude that permeated the trading desk of the former energy giant, analysts said. 
""I don't think that's the culture most of these banks have,"" said Gordon Howald, an analyst who follows energy merchants for Credit Lyonnais Securities in New York. 
William Hyler, an analyst with CIBC World Markets Corp. in New York, predicted ""a smaller version of the old Enron."" 
The temporarily-dubbed New Energy Trading Company, or NETCO, might have no choice but to play a smaller role in the gas and power trading markets Enron helped create as executives could have trouble wooing back Enron's former business partners. 
The Atlanta-based InterContinental Exchange and the online trading platform owned by Dynegy Inc. of Houston have both reported significant gains in trading volume since Enron's demise. 
""It's not like we're all sitting around here doing nothing now that Enron's gone,"" said Eric van der Walde, executive vice president of trading and marketing for American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio. ""The market is just fine."" 
Not everyone agrees. 
Charlie Sanchez, who oversees the energy trading desk at Gelbert and Associates in Houston, said energy traders long for the enormous trading volume Enron brought to the industry with its appetite for risk and willingness to take on nearly every buy or sell order that appeared on its Internet-based platform, EnronOnline. 
""I get frustrated now and then because I don't have the liquidity that I had in the past,"" Sanchez said. 
As a result, the spread between what sellers are asking and buyers are offering on other exchanges is not always always as tight as it was on EnronOnline, a sign of less efficiency, he said. 
But recreating EnronOnline will not be easy. ""Bridges were burned"" when investors and traders alike lost confidence in the company, Sanchez said. 
Whether EnronOnline or NETCO ever get off the ground, and in what form, remains uncertain. 
A New York bankruptcy judge will have the final word Friday on any sale that takes place during Thursday's auction. More than a dozen Enron creditors have filed objections to the sale, essentially because they want a better explanation of how the proceeds will be divvied up. 
In approving any sale, Judge Arthur Gonzalez is likely to address creditors' concerns in his ruling. If they remain dissatisifed, creditors will have 10 days to appeal the ruling. 
Lawyers for various creditors have acknowledged their own interest in moving the sale along, because much of the remaining value at Enron is its top-notch energy traders, who are increasingly at risk of being hired away by competitors. 
John Olson, a securities analyst who follows energy merchants for Sanders Morris Harris Group Inc. in Houston, said any new partner would do itself - and energy markets - a favor by restoring the Enron of old, save for its controversial accounting practices. 
""If banks want to see the $15 billion they are owed, they are going to have to run this thing relatively aggressively,"" Olson said. ""Otherwise it becomes just another trading platform."" 
Enron did not return a call seeking comment about its intentions for NETCO.

Enron Creditors Ask Judge To Delay Trading Assets Sale
2002-01-09 09:07 (New York)

   By Carol S. Remond and Kathy Chu 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Even before an auction of bankrupt Enron Corp. (ENE)'s
trading business later this week, creditors are lining up to oppose the sale. 
  Creditors are concerned about how Enron will allocate money from that auction
to its bankrupt units, and are asking federal bankruptcy judge Arthur J.
Gonzalez to oppose, or at least delay, an approval of the sale, which was to
come as early as Friday. 
  More than 15 companies have now filed motions asking the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York to delay the approval of any offer 
for Enron's power-trading business, which was by far the largest and most
profitable operation of the vast company. The companies want time to figure out
which assets are up for sale, which of the more than 3,000 Enron affiliates and
other entities will benefit from the sale and how various creditors will be
affected. 
  Under a plan to bring back some value to its now moribund trading operations,
including EnronOnline - which until not so long ago accounted for 25% of all
wholesale energy trading in the U.S. - Enron is seeking a 51% joint  venture
partner to form a new company dubbed New Energy Trading Company, or NETCO. 
  Enron plans to contribute its trading software and hardware, among other
things, to the joint venture in exchange for a 49% share. So far, Citigroup NA 
and UBS AG have been reported to have made sealed bids. An auction is scheduled
for Thursday. 
  At stake is how cash that may potentially be generated by the sale will be 
used. 
  In its motion opposing the sale, for instance, the Royal Bank of Scotland
Group PLC said, ""Absent a disclosure of the intended uses for the proceeds of 
this sale, the creditors are unable to gauge that the benefits are adequate,
appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries."" 
  Further scrutinizing the way Enron has been managing its cash, the Royal Bank
of Scotland, one of Enron's large creditors, raises the possibility that Enron
may have already consolidated cash between different of its entities before it
filed for bankruptcy on Dec.2. 
  ""If this anecdote were to be correct, no disclosure has been made (nor has
the time necessary to conduct a review elapsed) to the extent, if any, that any
of these businesses stand as a constructive trustee of assets or monies for the
benefit of other entities or creditors,"" the Royal Bank of Scotland stated in a
court filing. 
  Gas and electricity trading company Aquila Inc. also expressed concerns about
the use of the proceeds of the trading assets sale, saying that proceeds  of
the sale should be put in escrow until it can be determined which units should
get the money.

Issue

  It's not the first time that questions have arisen about how Enron will
distribute money coming into the company. 
  Last month, Merrill Lynch briefly withheld $371 million of the distressed
company's funds in a brokerage account until Enron and the bankruptcy court
could clarify which of the company's entities was entitled to it. 
  The court's verdict: The money will be governed by a centralized
cash-management system - put in place shortly after Enron filed for bankruptcy
Dec. 2 - under which all funds collected by any Enron entity is swept up to the
parent  and later dispersed accordingly to subsidiaries. 
  For now, this means that any cash generated on settlements to Enron's units
should be used to pay those units' debtors. 
  But that could change, according to bankruptcy experts, if Enron decides in
the future to effect a ""substantive consolidation"" of its assets. This is
relatively common in Chapter 11 cases, and in essence, would put all of the
company's assets into one pot to be distributed to a larger circle of
creditors. 
  A substantive consolidation, if it eventually occurs, is likely to simplify
Enron's role in dispersing funds, but may benefit some creditors and put others
at a disadvantage. 
  Given that the Chapter 11 proceedings are still in the early stages, it's
difficult to gauge whether this is a viable option, said Joel Kay, an attorney
who specializes in bankruptcy cases at Hughes, Watters & Askanase LLP, Houston.
Enron attorneys didn't immediately return phone calls seeking  comment. 
  There's also another concern. 
  Wiser Oil, a creditor who is owed about $7 million under oil- and gas-hedging
contracts with the Enron North America unit, believes that Enron's $1.5 billion
debtor-in-possession  financing could mean bad news for the beleaguered
company's subsidiary. 
  ""The concern is that Enron North America's assets are being pledged as
collateral to secure repayment of the DIP facility even though it's unclear how
much, if any, of the DIP borrowing will actually go to this unit,"" said Deborah
A. Reperowitz, of Reed Smith LLP, which represents Wiser. 
  So far, Enron hasn't drawn on its DIP facility, which is led by J.P. Morgan
and Citigroup. But if the company does, and there are insufficient funds to
repay this loan in the future, then Enron North America's assets may be on the
hook,  according to Reperowitz. 
  Wiser, in a filing late Tuesday, also objected to the court's expected
approval of a portion of Enron's energy-trading unit. Energy trading accounted
for about 90% of Enron's $101 billion in revenue last year. 
  The sale should not be allowed to go through because the ""timing and terms""
make it impossible for creditors to determine which assets are to be sold, the
value of these assets and where proceeds will be allocated, Wiser said. 
  Other entities that have expressed concern about the sale  in recent court
filings include General Electric Co.'s (GE) General Electric Capital Corp.,
Pure Resources Inc., Tenaska Marketing Ventures, Forest Oil Corp., Devon Energy
Corp., Magnum Hunter Production Inc., Petro-Hunt LLC and Spinnaker Exploration
Co (SKE), Exco Resources Inc., Eco-Tankship Inc.,  Powerex Corp, and El Paso
Corp.'s (EPG) El Paso Merchant Energy LP.

Some Enron Bidders May Be Playing Wait-And-See Game
2002-01-09 08:16 (New York)

   By Kathy Chu and Carol S. Remond 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Several financial institutions may be interested in
beleaguered Enron Corp.'s (ENE) core energy trading operations, but won't make
a move until Thursday's auction, according to people familiar with the matter. 
  The strategy: Wait to see what value is assigned to parts of the struggling
business in order to cut down on due-diligence efforts and to eliminate some of
the pricing uncertainty inherent in any bidding process. 
  ""The advantage in doing this is that you get others to reveal their hands,
and that information gives you a stronger hand to proceed,"" said Margaret
Howard, a scholar-in-residence at the American Bankruptcy Institute, a
nonprofit think tank in Alexandria, Va. 
  Reportedly, Citigroup Inc. (C) and UBS AG (UBS) have made undisclosed bids
for a majority of the business, while integrated oil concern BP PLC (BP) has
offered $25 million to buy part of Enron's computer support systems. 
  Expect other key players to emerge at the auction, and possibly after that,
as companies still are trying to determine which part of Enron's core business
they want - and whether the reward is likely to exceed the risk, said people
familiar with the matter. 
  Enron's official creditors committee will review the bids currently on the
table and make a recommendation to the company. The chosen bid will be unveiled
at the auction, after which counteroffers may be made. 
  Legal experts believe that counteroffers likely will be close in value to
that of the chosen bid - at least initially - based on the presumption that
large financial institutions such as Citigroup and UBS have done their homework
and valued the operations accordingly. 
  Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern
District of New York is expected to approve an offer for part of the energy
trading business Friday. 
  So far, the tepid pace of the bidding process - no ""stalking horse"" offer,
which would have set a floor for the bidding, was received before the Jan. 7
deadline - may indicate that interested parties are having difficulty valuing a
business that collapsed amid a loss of shareholder confidence following Enron's
disclosure of massive financial woes. 
  ""The value is a bit of a wild card,"" said James Bromley, a bankruptcy lawyer
at Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton. ""You have to look at what (the business)
was worth when Enron was running it, and going forward, what its limits will
be."" 
  It's unlikely that many bidders will come forward for the unit's trading
contracts, the value of which Enron has estimated at $5 billion to $7 billion.
In late December, Martin Bienenstock of Weil Gotshal & Manges law firm, which
represents Enron, said interested parties were focusing instead on the energy
trading operations' hardware and software - including the valuable online
trading platform. 
  Financial institutions, to which Enron owes more than $15 billion, have a
large stake in seeing the energy trading operations - which generated the
lion's share of the overall company's revenue last year - restored, as this
increases the odds that their debts will be paid. 
  Enron hopes that its creditworthy partner - which could take up to a 51%
stake in the operations to be renamed New Energy Trading Co. - will bring
business back for what was once the nation's largest energy trader.

Several bid for Enron trading ops
Winner to be announced Thursday

By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 4:06 PM ET Jan. 8, 2002

NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Weil, Gotshal & Manges, the lead law firm for bankrupt Enron, has received several bids for its client's trading operations, according to a report Tuesday.

Platt's, an energy industry trade publication, reported that multiple bids had been filed with Weil, Gotshal, though it did not identify either the bidders or the number of offers. Citigroup, a lender to Enron, and UBS Warburg, have previously been reported to be among the bidders.

Weil plans to announce the winning bidder at its New York offices Thursday, and then present the offer to the U.S. bankruptcy court in New York for approval on Friday. The court is hearing arguments from creditors on why the case should be transferred to Texas.

Shares of Enron added 5 cents to close at 73 cents a share on volume of 23.2 million.

Weil, Gotshal and Enron were not available for comment.

Also Tuesday, the Brazilian state company Petrobras said in a press release through La Nacion/SABI that it is interested in buying Enron's natural gas assets in Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil. Enron owns 35 percent of the shares of the Argentinian gas transporter Transportadora de Gas del Sur, according to the Petrobras statement.

Enron in 6 energy policy meetings
Cheney's counsel: Firm's finances weren't discussed

By William L. Watts <mailto:bwatts@marketwatch.com>, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 5:55 PM ET Jan. 8, 2002
WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- Enron representatives met six times last year to discuss energy policy with Vice President Dick Cheney or members of his energy task force, a White House attorney told a Democratic lawmaker.
Cheney met only once with Ken Lay, chief executive of the collapsed energy giant, on April 17 to discuss energy policy matters, David Addington, counsel to the vice president, wrote in a letter dated Jan. 4. 
Cheney had revealed the meeting in a television interview last May.
Enron and task force officials discussed only policy matters and never talked about the company's financial position, according to Addington.
Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, released the letter on Tuesday. According to Addington, Enron officials participated in meetings with members of the task force on five other occasions.
Enron last month filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history after a dramatic stock slide that erased more than $26 billion in shareholder value. Congressional Democrats and Republicans, as well as numerous regulatory agencies, have opened probes into the collapse.
Democrats also want to look at the relationship between Enron and the White House. Lay, a personal friend of President Bush, was a top GOP fund-raiser.
Waxman, in a letter to Cheney, noted that the first meeting was held Feb. 22, with the last meeting on Oct. 10, six days before Enron announced a $1.2 billion cut restatement that launched the stock slide. 
The task force released its energy policy recommendations in May. The GOP-controlled House passed energy legislation based on the report last year. Similar legislation bogged down in the Democratic-led Senate, where a battle is expected over a provision to open part of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration.
Waxman, in a letter to Cheney, responded that the information provided by Addington shows that ""access provided to Enron far exceeded the access provided by the White House to other parties interested in energy policy.""
Democrats and environmental groups have charged that the energy task force may have violated federal open meeting laws by huddling behind closed doors with energy industry officials. The Addington letter marked the first detailed White House response to queries by Waxman.
Addington said the Enron meetings weren't out of the ordinary.
""The group's support staff held such meetings with a broad representation of people potentially affected by the group's work,"" he wrote.
Waxman said the Addington letter didn't reveal enough information, including what was discussed at the meetings, requests for policy changes, copies of documents from the meetings and names of people attending the meetings.
He also repeated his request for information regarding other contacts between Enron officials and the White House, including telephone conversations and e-mail communications.

USA: GAO to decide within month on suing White House.

01/09/2002
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2002.

WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The head of Congress' investigative arm said on Wednesday he would decide within a month whether to sue the White House over its refusal to name industry executives the administration met with last year while drafting a new energy policy. 
Citing the right of Congress to oversee the executive branch, the General Accounting Office has been trying for months to get details of the workings of the administration's task force that drew up the energy program.
But the White House has largely rebuffed the GAO's efforts to get the information about the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), as the task force was called. It was headed by Vice President Dick Cheney. 
""I expect to make a decision on whether to file suit regarding GAO's access to NEPDG records within a month,"" Comptroller General David Walker said in a brief statement. 
Should Walker decide to go ahead and sue, it could add to growing Capitol Hill scrutiny of the collapsed energy giant Enron Corp. , whose executives the White House has acknowledged consulting with while writing its energy plan. 
The White House said in a letter to a lawmaker released on Tuesday that Cheney or his staff met six times with Enron representatives last year. 
GAO's Walker, in his statement Wednesday, said he was aware of the communication between Cheney's office and the lawmaker, Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat.

Fitch: Northern Natural Gas On Rating Watch Positive

01/09/2002
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2002, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 9, 2002--The Rating Watch status for Northern Natural Gas Co.'s (NNG) `CC' rated senior unsecured debt has been changed to Positive from Negative. NNG has approximately $500 million of senior unsecured debt outstanding. The change in rating status follows the recent announcement that Dynegy Inc. (DYN) has settled its lawsuit with Enron Corp. to exercise its option to acquire NNG. The parties have agreed to close the transaction by the end of January 2002. In return, the option Enron has to repurchase the pipeline for $1.5 billion has been extended from May 9, 2002 to June 30, 2002. 
As part of the now terminated merger agreement between DYN and Enron, DYN made a $1.5 billion capital contribution to Enron structured as a preferred stock investment in NNG with the option to purchase a single purpose entity that owns 100% of NNG's common stock. Following the termination of its merger agreement, DYN immediately exercised its option to purchase NNG. A payment of $23 million by DYN is required at closing to complete the sale.
NNG's current `CC' rating reflects its position as a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron. Enron's ratings were lowered to `D' on Dec. 3, 2001, following its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. An additional negative rating consideration is the structural subordination unsecured lenders have to a fully-drawn $450 million secured bank facility. In order to provide additional liquidity for Enron in the weeks prior to its bankruptcy filing, NNG negotiated a $450 million 364-day credit facility secured by NNG's capital stock, a subordinated note from Enron to NNG, and substantially all the other assets of NNG. 
It is expected that NNG will be operated as a subsidiary of Dynegy Holdings Inc., which is rated `BBB+', Rating Watch Negative. Following the purchase by DYN, Fitch anticipates rating NNG in the high `BBB' range. NNG's prospective rating will be affected by whether DYN fully pays off NNG's secured loan, elevating unsecured debt to its prior senior status. However, Fitch will likely put NNG on Rating Watch Negative in consideration of Enron's repurchase option through June 30, 2002. 
On a standalone basis NNG historically has demonstrated a strong financial profile and solid market position. Through mid-2001, EBITDA-to-interest coverage was nearly 7.0 times (x) and debt-to-capital at June 30, 2001, was 32%. At that time NNG was rated `A-`. Including the secured loan, total debt-to-capital remains slightly below 50%. The pipeline continues to benefit from strong and consistent cash flow derived from long-term contracts with creditworthy counterparties and favorable FERC regulation.

Two Civil Lawsuits Filed Against Enron In Texas Court
By Erwin Seba

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Two civil lawsuits alleging Enron Corp. executives and directors (ENE) misrepresented the company's financial condition to shareholders have been filed in Harris County District Court in Houston.
The suits also allege Arthur Andersen L.L.P. and two of its partners in Houston didn't correctly audit Enron's financial reports. 
""Had plaintiffs and the marketplace known of the true operating and financial results of Enron, which, due to the actions or inactions of defendants were not disclosed, plaintiffs would not have purchased or otherwise acquired their Enron common stock or, if they had acquired Enron common stock in the past, they would have divested their holdings of Enron stock,"" according to the filings in both cases. 
One suit, brought by Irene and Ruben Delgado, was filed on Friday. The other suit, brought by Mary Bain Pearson and John Mason, was filed on Monday. 
The Delgados, Pearson and Mason are described in the filings as ""citizens of the state of Texas who own Enron common stock."" 
They are all represented by G. Sean Jez, of the Houston law firm of Fleming & Associates L.L.P. 
A representative for Arthur Andersen declined to comment on the cases. Enron representatives didn't reply to phone messages.

Enron's Creditors: Y'all Come Back To Texas 
01.08.02, 9:13 AM ET
Forbes.com

NEW YORK - Enron has already made a mockery of the nation's financial reporting system and has started to make an equal farce of its bankruptcy system. This was the argument made yesterday by lawyers for Enron's creditors who are seeking to transfer the bankruptcy case from New York to Houston. 

Enron's headquarters is in Houston, its top executives are all there, as are the vast majority of its assets--and its name is even on the ballpark. But it filed its Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition not in Houston, but New York. The reason, according to a lawyer for Enron, is that it would be easier for bankers and potential business partners to participate in the case in New York. 
Creditors' lawyers argued yesterday that it would be more convenient for everyone else, including Enron's present and former employees and retirement-plan participants, to place the case in Houston 

Arthur Gonzalez, the federal bankruptcy judge in New York, said he will rule on whether he will keep the case or kick it to the Southern District of Texas by the end of the week. 

Separately, Enron received bids for control of its energy-trading arm from Citigroup, BP Plc and UBS AG, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. 

Rhett Campbell, a Houston lawyer representing some of Enron's creditors, conceded at a standing-room-only, five-hour hearing yesterday that Enron had a narrow technical right to file its bankruptcy petition in New York. The reason, apparently, is that Enron Metals and Commodity, one of the dozens of Enron affiliates to participate in the filing, is based in Manhattan. 

But Enron Metals reports just $265 million in assets, which represents less that one-half of 1% of the $51.4 billion in total assets of the Enron companies participating in the filing. Even Enron Metals, Campbell said, is actually run by executives in Houston or London. To allow the location of the tiny subsidiary to fix the venue of the case would be ""totally the tail wagging the dog,"" Campbell said. 

Of Enron's 345 top executives and officers, 209 work in Houston, according to both Enron and its creditors. Enron says it does not know the location of 79 of the remaining 136--or whether they still work for the company. They are lost, it seems. More than 99% of Enron's assets and office space are in Houston, too. 

Thousands of Enron employees, mostly in Houston, have been tossed out of work and have seen their retirement savings decimated. ""The brunt of the pain will be felt in Houston,"" said David Burns, a lawyer representing creditors including Reliant Energy and Dynegy.  The bankruptcy court in Houston is four blocks from Enron's headquarters. 

While it's understandable that Enron might fear the wrath of a judge in Texas, the company claims it had the convenience of its bankers in mind in selecting the Southern District of New York. Martin Bienenstock, Enron's chief lawyer in New York, said it would be easier for business partners and potential witnesses involved in Enron's worldwide operations to participate if the proceedings took place in New York. ""The banks are working [Enron's reorganization] out in New York,'' he said. The bankers' lawyers agree the case should stay in front of Judge Gonzalez. 

But lawyers for creditors argued that many more creditors in terms of numbers were in Texas rather than New York. Most of the big banks and bondholders are based in New York, but the creditors argued that it would be easier for a few bankers to jet to Houston than it would be for thousands of Enron vendors and its 12,000 401(k) plan participants to visit New York for hearings in the case. 

Enron argued that the debtor's choice of venue should be afforded ""deference"" by the court. But the creditors argued that the company was not exercising a valid business judgement, but was participating in legal gamesmanship. Enron wanted the case to be far from its Houston home, because it chafes under supervision, whether from regulators or its own accountant, Arthur Andersen, which claims to have been misled by Enron executives. If the case were allowed to stay in New York, the entire bankruptcy system would fall into disrepute, Campbell argued. 

Enron collapsed late last year when questionable accounting practices and mounting off-balance sheet debt caused investors and traders to lose confidence in the company. Its stock price, trading above $85 one year ago, is now firmly below $1 per share. 

Successful transfer motions are relatively rare, but Enron creditors argued this case should be the exception because there are thousands of small creditors based in Houston. Creditors' lawyers called the Enron case a ""poster child"" for transfer.

SMALL FAVOR / After so much woe, Enron backdown a tiny bright spot

(Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle) 

Houston-based energy companies Enron Corp. and Dynegy have settled one of their legal disputes, allowing Dynegy to take control of Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline. It was easy to be sympathetic to Dynegy's position, which was that it was entitled to the pipeline as part of its aborted deal to buy troubled Enron. 
Who can blame Dynegy for claiming the rights to the pipeline? With the pipeline as collateral, Dynegy forked over $1.5 billion to Enron only to discover that the pipeline was just about the only valuable asset Enron owned and, furthermore, that the company had horribly misrepresented its financial position.
Under the settlement, Dynegy will take control of the pipeline at the end of the month. Enron gets an extension on its option to buy back the pipeline, for $1.5 billion. Where Enron would come up with that kind of capital, considering how much it owes its creditors, is anyone's guess. 
Dynegy's takeover would give a measure of job security to the 200 or so Houston employees of the pipeline system, which runs from Texas' Permian Basin to the upper Midwest. As Enron is working through history's largest Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding and has laid off most of the rest of its Houston work force, the fate of the employees still on Enron's payroll is in serious doubt. 
Also in doubt is Enron's hope of pinning a comeback on its pipelines, including the disputed Northern Natural Gas line. That and the $10 billion lawsuit the fading giant filed against Dynegy for declining to consummate the merger deal appear to many disappointed Houstonians, dumbfounded employees and ruined stockholders to be moves of desperation rather than legitimate and realistic pursuits. 
Once a Houston darling, Enron has perpetrated a great deal of misery here of late. Its agreement to settle this narrow pipeline issue in a sea of ongoing litigation, likely saving a couple of hundred local jobs, is one small bit of decent news in an overwhelmingly sad story.

Creditors try to relocate Enron case / Bankruptcy judge to decide by weekend: Houston or New York

NEW YORK - A group of Enron Corp. creditors Monday assailed the company's decision to file the largest bankruptcy case in history in New York and urged a judge to transfer the case to Houston. 
Creditors ranging from Reliant Energy to the Southern Ute Indian tribe, employees who lost money in the company's 401(k) plan and the Texas Attorney General's office tried to persuade U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur Gonzalez that the case belongs in Enron's hometown.
""We find it galling once the stock collapses that Enron runs out of the district,"" argued Ron Kilgard, a Phoenix attorney representing employees and retirees who participated in the company's retirement plan. 
The judge promised to rule on the location by week's end. 
And while the parties were arguing, an unspecified number of firms were submitting sealed bids for control of Enron's trading business, the crown jewel of the once-mighty energy firm. 
A coalition of smaller creditors pointed out that while New York may be a convenient locale for Enron's largest creditors, the distance represents a real burden for the many individuals and smaller investors injured by the company's meltdown. 
Rhett Campbell, representing Petro-Hunt and other creditors, argued that $50 billion worth of Enron's assets are in Texas, compared with $285 million in New York. When Enron officials were divvying up $55 million to 587 key employees to keep them from jumping ship, 516 of those critical managers lived in Houston. 
""It's easier for the big banks to go to Houston than for the thousands of small creditors to come to New York,"" Campbell argued. 
But this group of creditors faces a tough legal hurdle. Both Enron's management and the company's official creditors' committee want the case to stay here in New York. 
And the law gives debtors like Enron fairly wide latitude in choosing a bankruptcy court. 
Martin Bienenstock, an attorney representing Enron in the bankruptcy case, argued that Enron is a global concern spanning 46 states and 20 other countries. 
The company was able to choose New York because of its metals- trading business' presence in the state. 
Of the company's 20 largest unsecured creditors, 11 are located in New York, and six of the 15 members of the creditors' committee live here, he said. 
While Houston is an important Enron center, only about one-third of Enron's employees now live there, Bienenstock said. 
Moving the case there would be ""a convenient panacea for a small minority"" of creditors. 
Enron and its creditors' committee took pains not to insult the judges on the bench in Houston. ""I'm not saying New York is better than anywhere else,"" Bienenstock said. 
But Marshall Scott Huebner, an attorney representing J.P. Morgan Chase, noted that ""with all due respect to Houston,"" no other bankruptcy court has had as much experience dealing with complex cases as the Enron matter is sure to be than the Southern District of New York. 
Gonzalez himself raised the issue of whether turning the case now to another court might disrupt the reorganization effort, since he has been handling the case for more than a month. 
Also Monday, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne confirmed the company received ""multiple"" bids for its trading business. 
Prior to Monday's deadline, 14 firms, including Citigroup, UBS Warburg and J.P. Morgan Chase, were known to have expressed interest in bidding for the trading operation. 
How many ultimately submitted firm proposals remained unclear late Monday. 
Enron and its creditors plan to conduct an auction Thursday to determine the winning bidder and present that offer to Gonzalez on Friday. 
Industry analysts say Enron's trading business could fetch bids of $1 billion or so. 
With 800 trading desks around the world, Enron's traders once dominated the oil, natural gas and electric power markets, while also swapping a host of other commodities. 
Enron's trading business was the company's largest revenue generator, accounting for about 80 percent of the firm's profits. 
But Enron's stupefying collapse and resulting bankruptcy filing scared off many of the companies that traded with Enron. 
Managers and the company's creditors believe bringing in a joint venture partner provides the best hope for salvaging that operation. 
The idea is that an infusion of working capital and the strong balance sheet of a joint venture partner would give other trading firms the confidence they need to do business with Enron again. 
For its part, Enron offers trading expertise to once again create a competitive trading operation.

CEOs of Leading Energy and Technology Companies to Forge Consensus on Restructuring Priorities for 2002

(Copyright (c) 2002, Business Wire)

WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 9, 2002-- 

Executive Committee of National Energy Marketers Association
Prioritizes Wholesale, Retail and Technology Issues for 2002 

The Executive Committee of the National Energy Marketers Association (NEM) will meet in Houston on January 17 to forge a consensus on federal legislation, wholesale, retail and technology issues and will be addressed by Texas PUC Commissioner Brett Perlman. 
""Given the recent developments in both the wholesale and retail markets as well as the events surrounding Enron, 2002 will be a crucial year for the restructuring of U.S. energy markets. Commissions in New York, Illinois, and Michigan are implementing important new rules this year, and both Texas and Virginia have just opened widely to competition,"" said Craig Goodman, president of NEM. 
""The first half of 2002 will focus heavily on restructuring wholesale energy markets to be more liquid, transparent and competitively neutral,"" said Clem Palevich, chairman of the NEM Executive Committee and president of AES New Energy. Major issues affecting the wholesale energy market on the agenda will include recommendations for competitive standardized market designs, and support for a wholesale electric standards board proposal. 
Additionally, NEM leaders will develop workable definitions of market power, economic withholding, energy affiliates, and rules for generation interconnection. ""Importantly, there will be major changes in credit and risk management. Given all of the recent attention generated by Enron, risk identification and valuation will be a major issue to be resolved this year,"" said Palevich. 
""2002 will also be pivotal in the development of competitive retail energy markets,"" said Goodman. ""A number of important states will be unbundling utility rates using embedded costs to offer consumers credits on utility bills to shop for competitive services. I am confident that competitive suppliers can beat the utility's embedded costs and provide consumers with meaningful price competition and better services and technologies. If commissions stay the course on embedded cost unbundling, this year will also be a major step forward for competitive billing, metering and related information services,"" said Goodman. 
NEM represents both wholesale and retail energy marketers as well as suppliers of energy-related products, services, information and technologies throughout the United States.

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

"my resume","Tom,

Thanks for taking the time to speak with me yesterday evening regarding the opportunity on your desk.  I am currently reviewing several internal opportunities and  returning to my gas roots is certainly a consideration.  

I currently work for Doug Gilbert-Smith our Long Term ERCOT trader and run the Real-Time ERCOT book.  I believe you know Doug who uses Eric to help us lock in forward heat rates at times.  Doug is aware of my desire for change, and he is discussing with Kevin Presto other opportunities for me to stay in power, however, I will look at all my option and be making my decision based on what I feel to be in the best interest of Enron and myself and my family.  Please review my resume and I would be happy to sit down with you to discuss my goals and why I am currently seeking a change.  For your convenience, I have also included a copy of my 2000 performance review.  

Sincerely,

Larry Jester

"CHAD - Attorney Client Privlege - Confidential","Confidential - Attorney Client Privlege

Please give me your thoughts on the attached proposal to resolve the ""dangling chads"" with AEP.  I have attached the proposal and a ""value analysis"" of the proposal, both of which I propose to send to AEP.  The key benefits of the proposal from Enron's perspective are the following:

1.	Removes us from the vagueness and uncapped exposure of the Ducote deal with Entex for additional costs.  AEP can capture the economics of future gas deliveres to Entex associated with this capital expenditure.

2.	Captures the leverage that AEP will have in the Entex audit.  I think for ENA to pursue Entex would be difficult/time consuming and may lead to a tortious interference suit from AEP.

3.	Gives up the interest payment we think AEP owes us.  This is true value we are giving up, but do we really want to fight with AEP in court over this (to the extent they are not bluffing)?

4.	Removes us from having to process imbalances - saving manpower costs and further removing us from hassles with AEP.  AEP is better able to capture value from these imbalances then we are, since they have the pipe.

5.	Gets us out of the Coastline law suit.  I'm pretty sure Coastline is at least owed the $1.4MM that we would contribute.  AEP has a chance to minimize any further costs, which are capped by the value of the claim at a further $2.2MM.

Please do not circulate this.

Thanks,
Brian

Enron Troubles Only the Tip of the Iceberg?

Dealings with a related party have tarnished Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) reputation and crushed its stock, but it looks like that case is far from unique. 
The battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities, according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing Enron. Moreover, Enron's new CFO, who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related-party dealings of his predecessor, serves on 12 of these entities. And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston-based related entity called ES Power 3. 
The extent of Enron's dealings with these companies, or the value of its holdings in them, couldn't be immediately determined. But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors' fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don't show up on its balance sheet. If that's so, the company's financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street, where the company was long treated with kid gloves. 
Enron didn't immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, in the various entities. Enron's board members couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
Ten Long Days
Enron's previous CFO, Andrew Fastow, was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow's role in a partnership called LJM, which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron. As details of this deal and two others emerged, Enron stock cratered. 
The turmoil that resulted in Fastow's departure began two weeks ago, when Enron reported third-quarter earnings that met estimates. However, the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $1.2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions. Since then, investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities. Enron stock sank 6% Friday, meaning it has lost 56% of its value in just two weeks.

However, Enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities. The company has said nothing publicly about McMahon's participation in related entities, nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3. (Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars-related names by the related-party companies.) It's not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does. So far, subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date, January 1999. 
Among ES Power 3's senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay, listed as a director, and McMahon and Fastow, listed as executive vice presidents. A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors, including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Hang Lung Group. A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn't commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn't immediately returned. 
Demands, Demands
Rating agencies Moody's, Fitch and S&P recently put Enron's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the $1.2 billion hit to equity. Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade. But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade, or junk, bonds, suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely. 
If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. 
Friday, the company drew down $3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations. Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron's condition. 
This week, a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron. However, in a Friday press release, CEO Lay said that Enron was the ""market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets."" He added: ""It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets."" 
McMahon reportedly objected to Fastow's role in LJM, allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests. But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he's connected to don't do the same. Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in. Now, board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity. 

Under The Radar: Enron's Flickering Bulb

While the bulb at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) may not have burnt out, it's clearly flickering. To date, investors aren't sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re-energizing the company he once built to greatness. 
What's happened at the Houston energy giant-turned-dwarf could've been imagined with any number of ne'er-do-well companies during the well-chronicled bubble. But this is Enron. As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said, ""I never had to worry about Enron's ability to survive until this week. I still find it hard to believe."" 
Peter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron's adventures for some time. If you'd listened to him earlier this year, you'd have profited from his knowledge. His reporting on Enron's partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding. 
The rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes. 
Now, Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and, more importantly, its reputation. 
The Company's Challenge
But what does Enron do now? It's very simple. Come clean, clean up the mess and refocus on its core business: wholesale energy markets, risk management and retail energy services. They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks. 
""Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off, and long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings, with upside potential to $25 per share over the next 12-18 months,"" says Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. ""We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery."" 
Dietert outlines four challenges for Enron. One, management must regain the Street's confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance-sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow. Two, Enron must maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Three, Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans. Four, Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book. 
Straightforward? Yes. Easy to accomplish? No. 
Although Enron says additional write-downs are unlikely -- except a $200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change -- analysts aren't so sure. They're focused on the company's Global Assets portfolio, sporting $6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) loss of $18 million over the past 12 months. 
The divestitures include $390 million in exploration and production assets in India, $250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and $250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General, which is set to close in 2002. There will likely be others. However, Enron has to execute here, and given the current state of its affairs, the seller will feel the pressure. 
The credit-rating issue is a fine line. The current ratings, BBB+ from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's, are three levels above non-investment grade. However, both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades. Dietert estimates that Enron's debt-to-market cap will be about 48% by year-end, and the company has interest coverage (EBITDA/ interest expense) of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the average S&P BBB-rated company has a debt-to-cap of 47.4% and interest coverage of about 6.1 times. The average BB company has debt-to-cap of 61.3% and interest expense of 3.8 times. 
Frankly, everything falls on Enron's management team and its ability to reassure investors. ""If Enron's management does not step up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy,"" Dietert says. ""In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive stocks down; the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades; potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure to Enron, limiting Enron's ability to generate earnings and cash flow."" 
It's time for Enron to grow up. Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk, I think it will. Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy. It's a tough call that requires strict, individual discipline. 
There's an irony to this whole story, especially in Enron's lack of candor in reporting its financial results. In a much-lauded advertising campaign, Enron, looking to challenge conventional wisdom, asks the simple question, ""Why? Ask why."" 
Investors are now asking. It's time for Ken Lay to answer.

DJ Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default
2001-10-26 17:14 (New York)

   By Kristen McNamara 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) retail sales unit defaulted on its
credit requirement in New England's wholesale power market this month, but the
event was neither unique nor newsworthy, the energy company and the
organization that developed the market's rules said Friday. 

  The operator of the region's wholesale power market informed Enron Energy
Services last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a
greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at
risk for expulsion from New England's market. 

  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that
triggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the
past, the market's rulemaker said. 

  ""I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
participants"" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, ""and it's never
been in the news,"" said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New
England Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region's
electricity market. ""My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
proportion."" 

  News of the Enron unit's default appeared in a trade publication and a major
metropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron's dealings with partnerships headed
by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company's
stock and bond prices. 

  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its
bonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem
within a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. 

  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region's power market,
to notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong
person, delaying the company's response, Mahoney said. 

  ""Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit,"" Mahoney said. 

  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England
spokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its
default. 

  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on
occasion, Foley and Doot said. 

  ""I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a participant
to find itself out of compliance,"" Doot said. ""Those things have in fact
happened from time to time.""

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s lawsuit
alleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services
could temporarily block the largest software company's high-speed
Internet service in some U.S. regions.

     Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company
from providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron
provides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in
the 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc.
operates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.

     Enron's lawsuit was filed yesterday. Microsoft had planned to
offer fast Internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to
give the largest software company access to potential customers in
29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is
making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner Inc.

     ``We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron as quickly
as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other
providers,'' Visse said.

     Officials at Houston-based Enron, the largest energy trader,
did not immediately return calls for comment.

                         The Agreement

     Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide
bandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron
isn't required to deliver operational broadband services if
Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow
Jones newswire reported.

     Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver
the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of
the deal, Dow reported.

     Enron's lawsuit comes after Microsoft said in an Oct. 23
letter that Enron will have breached the contract if it hasn't
provided an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, allowing
Microsoft to recover damages.

     Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 36 cents
to $62.20, while Enron shares fell 95 cents to $15.40.

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for a shareholder
suing Enron Corp. are asking executives of the largest energy
trader to disclose any income they made from their involvement
with affiliated companies that bought and sold Enron assets.

     Lawyers have made the requests to President Greg Whalley,
Vice Chairman Mark Frevert and Chief Financial Officer Jeff
McMahon and 83 other employees arrived at Enron's Houston offices
this week, said Paul Paradis, a partner in the New York law firm
Abbey Gardy. Requests also were sent to 17 Enron partnerships such
as Whitewing Management and Marlin Water.

     Paradis represents Fred Greenberg, an Enron shareholder who
is suing the company's board for allowing former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at
least $35 million in cash and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder
equity.

     The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives
benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of
partnerships that bought and sold company assets. Enron formed at
least 18 such affiliated companies, listing executives and
employees as officers and directors of the partnerships, according
to Texas secretary of state records.

     Under Texas law, failure to respond to the document requests
will result in subpoenas being issued. Subpoenas could go out next
week if responses don't arrive by then, Paradis said. Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to requests for comment
about the document requests.

     The executives earned no income from the partnerships, Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer has said. ``There are no financial interests
in the structures themselves for any Enron employee,'' Palmer
said. He said it's common for a company to name its executives to
the boards of affiliates.

                       Affiliates Have Debts

     Texas records show Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay,
Frevert, Whalley, McMahon and dozens of other people who list
their address as Enron's corporate headquarters serving as
officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign
business corporations.

     The document requests ask Enron executives for information on
any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the
affiliates, including stock grants and options. They also ask the
executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the
affiliates.

     Enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets
such as power plants and natural-gas pipelines. That allowed Enron
to move debt associated with those projects off its books.

     The affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money. They
plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets. Enron
might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and
the debt. That could amount to at least $3.3 billion if the assets
don't generate any money, a remote possibility, the company has
said.

                            Few Answers

     Investors and analysts pressed Enron Chief Executive Officer
Kenneth Lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a
conference call Tuesday.

     Today, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to
questions about one of them, ES Power 3 LLC.

     Texas records list 78 Enron executives and employees as
officers, directors and managers of ES Power 3 LLC. The entire
Enron board is also listed.

     Shares of Enron $1.15 to $15.20 in late trading.

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)
2001-10-26 16:15 (New York)

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Sacramento, California, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into
partnerships run by the former chief financial officer, remains a
target of investigations and lawsuits in California.

     California lawmakers and regulators have accused power
providers of manipulating the state's energy market to raise
prices. Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers
have denied the charges repeatedly.

     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the
power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and
other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
documents. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,
California.

     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I
don't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra
Montgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be
seen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.

     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
California soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities
insolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market
to competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison
International weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.

     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the
committee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are
putting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to
a speedy resolution.''

     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half
since Oct. 16. The company ousted Andrew Fastow as the chief
financial officer Wednesday amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron $35
million.

                            Grand Jury

     Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
civil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer, who convened a grand jury in June.

     Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling
the Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron
Chairman Kenneth Lay in ``an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey.' '' Lockyer
later apologized for the remark.

     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer
spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know
when civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power
providers might be filed.

     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We
had to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that
slowed things down a bit.''

     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney
general's investigation.

     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.

                           More Lawsuits

     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke
Energy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging
they manipulated California energy prices in violation of
antitrust laws.

     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the
City of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz
Bustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts
awaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer
representing Bustamante. The lawsuits should be assigned to a
judge by the end of next month, he said.

     If the complaints succeed, the companies might be ordered to
repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines, including
triple damages.

     Enron's stock fell 95 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $15.40,
declining for the eighth day in a row. The shares have fallen 80
percent in the past 12 months.

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)

     (Adds investor comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares
fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3 billion credit
line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans.

     The company's stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days
after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by
Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents,
or 5.8 percent, to $15.40 today.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure
investors that the company's credit rating won't be cut, investors
said. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets,
where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer.

     ``Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,''
said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth
Third Bancorp. ``People are questioning the credibility of
management.''

      The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion
in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer said.

                            Bonds Drop

     Enron's 6 3/4 percent bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 1
1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86
cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of ``BBB+,''
yield 9.53 percent.

     Investors have grown concerned that the company's credit
rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses
from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash
daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to
settle transactions.

     Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ``a smart
financial move,'' said Stephen Moore, a vice president at Moody's
Investors Service who follows the company. ``It took away the
hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and
insured access to capital.''

     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies
with ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for
seven years.

     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value
of Enron investors' stock.

     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron
assets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep related debt off its books. The
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets.

                         Other Liabilities

     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money
comes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt.

     One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would
thin out the holdings of every other investor.

     Of the two main bond-rating companies, Moody's and Fitch have
Enron on watch for possible downgrade, and Standard & Poor's
lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative. Egan-Jones
Rating Co. today lowered its rating on Enron's debt to ``BB+,''
one notch below investment grade, from ``BBB-.''

     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amount
to at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.

     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on
Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct
losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.

     ``It looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for
the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the
benefit of himself,'' Fifth Third's Cassady said.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Lay said in a
statement.

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron's retirement and 401(k) plans. 
The investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.
On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking ""non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share,"" in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron's CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets. 
If you are a member of an Enron retirement plan, wish to discuss this announcement, or have information relevant to the investigation, you may contact paralegal Liza Catabay, or any member of our team (Britt Tinglum, Liza Catabay, or Lynn Sarko) toll free at 800/776-6044, or via e-mail at investor@kellerrohrback.com. 
Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade. Its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars.

"RE: Re-start/Integration Planning","EnronOnline/NetCoOnline status update:

- ""NetCoOnline"" will be distinct from EnronOnline, with much the same functionality and a refreshed look.

- We will carry data to support the same gas and power products as were on EnronOnline. Please contact us if you will need different products from what was on EnronOnline.

- We have prepared a list of top customers in CDN and US Gas and Power (copy attached), which we will be using as a guide in chasing signed Password Applications.

- To speed the registration process, top customers will be preloaded into the system for activation as soon as we receive their Password Application. 

- We are intending to use a simple, online GTC, which can be superceded by a negotiated Master Agreement, as with EnronOnline.

- Internal trader names have been circulated to each desk head for approval.

Subject:	Re-start/Integration Planning

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)

"Tenaska Service Agreement","Hey Tom,
Rita Wynne just called and let me know that we need to make a payment to TXU on behalf of Tenaska.  Since TXU has terminated agreements with us, the Cash Management Committee will not make payments to TXU unless they understand the deal that is in place with Tenaska and we show that Tenaska has already paid us their part.  Could you please help Chip Schneider, of Enron Underwriting, and myself get up to speed on this as quickly as possible.  TXU is threatening to take action on Tenaska.  Thanks for your help.
