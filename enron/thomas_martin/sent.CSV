Almost no notice is needed as long as the Products you intend to use are ones which previously appeared on EnronOnline.

Please note that Jan. 21 is a holiday, so we are planning on the launch of NetcoOnline happening on Tuesday, Jan. 22.

Thanks for the info.

Sorry, I thought you already had that info.  Phase 1 is the day we turn on EOL (January 21st), Phase 2 is February.  This timing should be consistent with the other gas regions.  Basically financial products first and physical products second.  If there is any changes between products in phase 1 and phase 2, how much lead time do you need?

"ESOP Rollover Clerical Error","
Robert,

Jeanie Slone has been in contact with you on my behalf about a clerical error that occurred when I tried to roll my remaining ESOP shares into the 401 K plan back in the August to September time frame.  She indicated that there may be reason to believe that I will be reimbursed for this error but you were waiting for further information on the matter.  Given that I will be going with the sale of the trading business to UBS in early to mid February, I wanted to get this situation cleaned up by then if at all possible.  What steps do we need to go through to get closure on this matter?  Is there anything I can do to help (ie. explain in person what happened)?

Any explanation that you can give as to how and when this error gets fixed will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Tom

"FW: EEX EFP","If you recall there was a physical term supply transaction done at Thompsonville with EEX during the time you were trying to get the letter of intent with AEP done.  I thought that there were some unique financing issues that required Enron to retain the transaction.  It appears that is not the case and since this supply is at a split connect location with HPL it should probably go with the sale.  I just want to make sure that the swap is done correctly to keep Enron whole.  Any thoughts?

Subject:	EEX EFP

The EEX deal is a pre-pay deal.  It is not a VPP deal.  It is a financial deal only, between an Enron company called Bob West Treasury and EEX.  It is a financial deal only - no physical vols.

In a completely separate financial hedge, EEX had hedged some gas vols with Fred Lagrasta [ENA].  Last December, EEX called wanting to EFP some of these vols.  This is completely between Fred/ENA and EEX.  It has nothing to do with our pre-pay.

David/Tom, I would say the decision if this deal stays with you or goes to AEP is up to Fred.  I just spoke with Fred and he said that they did just one EFP with EEX - some south Texas [Thompsonville] vols.  He is uncertain as to the term, but off the top of his head, he thought it was for 2 or 3 years.  He said it didn't matter to him if we kept this EFP or if it went to AEP, as long as we were paid - it is way in the money.  This EFP should be in Tom's book and if it is decided to go to AEP, then this needs to be reflected in the final purchase price to AEP, since it is in the money.  BOTTOM LINE:  it doesn't matter to Fred, as long as we are paid for this.

If you have any questions re this EFP, please discuss with Fred.

"RE:","John,

My suggestion is to have the offsite to be social in nature.  I am sure that many of these people do not know each other and an environment where the group can mingle and enjoy some fun activities would be a great way to become more familiar with each other.  If we must have meetings/presentations, have them done by outside speakers so the group does not have to prepare presentations.  As far as where to go: Austin, San Antonio or Galveston are nice and will be reasonable for a group this size.  If you are ok with spending more the golfing, fishing and Spa activities in Florida (Miami, Key West, Tampa/St. Pete) are great.  Also golfing, rafting and Spa's in Colorado would be good too.

I don't have a strong preference for where we go but I do believe that people would appreciate a focus on fun and getting to know each other.

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

Please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from May 2000 and May 2001.  There are two tabs, one tab contains the days May 16-18, 2000 and the other tab contains the days May 14-18, 2001.  Each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question.  The days most directly comparable are May 17, 2001 (Thursday) and May 18, 2000 (Thursday), although the two days preceding May 18, 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding May 17, 2001.  The peak on 5/17/2001, 44,923 MW, is 2.78% higher than the peak on 5/18/2000, 43,709 MW.  With similarly warm days before 5/17/2001 as there were before 5/18/2000, the peak would obviously have been even higher.  This would put the year-over-year growth in excess of 3%.  I believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year-over-year from an earlier analysis, somewhere in the range of 3.5% to 4%.  

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Hi, Tom.  Assuming my children are not SICK!! ... what's the norm about the ""Bring Your Child to Work Day"" on the Trading Floor?  It's June 29th, and I just thought that I would inquire about it.  I had heard that it's just not done on the trading floor (??).  

My husband works on the Broadband Trading Floor, and we had thought that maybe we could bring both children (one stay with me and the other stay with him), and then switch at lunch time so that they can see where the both of us work.  It's not a big deal though ... the kids won't be terribly hurt because they would be missing out on swimming day at the daycare if they come to work with us on that day.  :o)

Let me know what you think,
Laura

"Employee Morale","
John,

A dangerous environment is brewing on the trading floor.  We have very large positions and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment, uncertain about future employment and now with new information about Lay's ""golden parachute"", I am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the Company (hero or zero attitude) or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade.  I hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the Company? (similar to what was done when we sold HPL).  The general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the ""little"" people that have been making the money for the Company are left out in the cold.  I also suggest that you move quickly to ensure appropriate compensation for key traders into next year.

I know the first move I suggested would have the effect of reducing morale further but this group has a lot of risk on for people that may not be 100% commited to Enron.  This may be too drastic action at this point but I think it should watched closely.

Lyne,
My name is Mark Bain and I'm the Web Site Adminstrator for the Mariners.  I
would be glad to help out in any way. Please pass this email and my phone
numbers (281-379-6896 hm. 281-518-3251 wk.) to your website person.  I put
alot of info in this email to help get started but if it is a little
overwhelming, just call.
A previous board member, Steve Burleigh, created our web site last year and
gave me alot of ideas. For this year, I found a web site called eTeamZ that
hosts web sites for sports groups.  Check out our new page:
http://www.eteamz.com/swimmariners/
eTeamsZ is really easy to use and does not require much web site knowledge.
They do the formatting and you supply the info.  If your web guru wants to
get creative, they can do some custome stuff as well.  The best part,
however, is that it is FREE.  Of course with free you have to put up with a
little advertising but since this site is tailor made for sports (meet
schedules, practice schedules calendars, news, maps, etc.) , I think it is
worth it.
If you don't decide to use eTeamZ, that's fine too.  I've created some other
web sites and should be able to answer some questions.  Sounds like you have
some experience so it should be no problem.  Good luck and let me know what
else you need.
eTeamZ TIPS:
Oh, here are some tips on getting started with eTeamZ.  (difficulties that I
had anyway):
Registration- http://www.eteamz.com/company/sites/register/
The toughest part was coming up with a nickname and a user name for the
websites.  Seems that most of the users are into baseball and Mariners was
taken.  I think I used Mariners Swim Team for nickname and goMariners for
the username because I kept hitting other name that were being used.
WebSite- When I got to the ""build you web"" page, I chose Team Web Site.
They also had options for Leagues and Orgs.
My best advice is to start populating things via the admin page and bring up
another windows to check the progress of what is actually displayed.
PLUS - They have a premium service called PLUS that you pay for but I didn't
see much use for it except you get rid of some of the advertising banners.
They also show that you can use this site for registration and other things
but we are keeping it pretty simple.

Cindy,
Oak Creek is wanting to start their own web page.  We had looked at the
Memorial Chase page last year and were very impressed by what you all had
done with it.  Is there someone at Memorial Chase that was involved with
setting up your web page that might be willing to answer a few questions for
us?  We have a board member that is familiar with how to set it up, but I
thought it might be beneficial for them to talk to someone that had done the
same thing for a NWAL team before they go much furthur.  Thanks for your
help.

"RE: HI!","I am sorry that you are having problems with Shanna.  I am proud that you are doing the right thing and welcoming a new person at school.  It can be very dificult to be the new kid at a new school.  It sounds like Shanna feels threaten by you and others being friendly to this new girl.  I know it is hard but some how you need to reassure Shanna that you being nice to the new girl does not mean she (Shanna) is less of your friend.  Maybe the best approach is to ask Shanna how she would feel if she had to move to a new school and was treated badly by some of the new girls she met.  You and Shanna have been friends for a long time and you don't want to lose that, but she needs to know that you will continue to welcome new kids that come school and it does not impact your friendship with her.

To answer your question, things are OK.  There is still a lot of uncertainty with the Dynegy and Enron merger and it is not going to be fixed any time soon.  All I can do is try to do the best job I can and let everything else work itself out.

I am going to an NWAL meeting tonight at 7:30 so I will see you probably about bed time.

Thanks for writing to me.

Love,

Dad

Bob,

I talked to Chris about the change of plans.  I am sorry that it did not work out but Dave has more knowledge of the Texas grid and he runs our Waha physical trading activities.  He works well with Mike and he is willing to do whatever we need him to do.  He is spending the rest of the week to suck as much out of Daren as he can.  If there is any training for the logistics systems that he can go to, he should do that as well.  If you have any other recomendations to get him up to speed on the Logistics side I sure would appreciate it.

"Texas Desk Employee Matters","I received notice today that Elsa Villareal , Gary Lamphier and Ed Gottlob have accepted jobs with AEP as part of the sale of HPL (not to leave until closing).    This means that my staffing needs after closing are as follows:

1 Lead Physical Trader
1 Physical Trader
1 Basis Trader (or at least an asst. trader)

1 Industrial/Utility Middle Marketer/Originator
1 Supply Middle Marketer/Originator

I met with Jeanie Slone and the internal recruiters today to start the external search process for an experienced physical trader and industrial marketer.
I am hoping the other positions can be filled internally with associates and/or internal commercial personnel.

I delivered employment contracts to Janet Wallis, Jim Schwieger, Stacy Neuweiller, Eric Bass and Daren Farmer.  They all wanted to review the documents and talk to me next week about it.  Janet did not give a good feeling that she would be willing to sign it.  I know that she has been contacted by companies other  than AEP about job opportunities and I know other Enron Units have talked to her as well.

Although we met Jim's numbers he is still hung up on the super vesting language for options; I'll keep working on him.

The others I did not get any read on, but I will talk to them next week.

Given the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the HPL transaction I want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and middle marketing desks to the Texas desk.

I will follow up with you when I return from vacation on Monday, March 19th.

Thanks,

"ESOP rollover into Savings Plan","I left you a voicemail as well.  I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it appears the ESOP rollover into Savings Plan ocurred as we discussed last week.  I got into the Savings Plan on Friday 11/23 and moved the Enron shares to Stable Assets also as we discussed.  It appears that the price used was Monday's close of $4.01 instead of Friday's close of $4.71.

So where do we go from here?  I am assuming per our previous meeting that whether $4.01 or $4.71 is used; that one of these prices will be used to keep me whole versus a price sometime in September (probably September 30th) when the ESOP shares should have been put into the Savings Plan.

Please call me at you earliest convenience to resolve this.

Enron plans asset sell-off to slash debt 


'We made some very bad investments,' Lay admits 

By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 

Enron Corp. officials admitted they made serious investment errors in recent years and will step up the pace of selling off those investments, including its broadband services group and some international operations.

Those business units, which are worth as much as $8 billion, could be sold off or spun out over the next year, the company said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. That would bring in more cash to pay down debt and trim away money-losing operations. 

Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay surprised many with a blunt assessment of the company's poor judgment in recent years that led to the rapid implosion of the energy trading giant's reputation and value in the past month. 

""In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,"" Lay said. ""The negative impact of these investments has been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet. We fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence."" 

To help make the cuts, the company is breaking its businesses into three groups: those that are the most profitable and part of its core business, such as energy and gas trading; those that are unprofitable and nonessential, such as overseas power plants; and those that have good profit potential in the near future that are under review, such as its steel, pulp and paper-trading operations. 

The noncore operations will be sold or closed down in an orderly fashion in the next year, said President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley. Those operations under review will be studied to see if they can contribute to the company's bottom line any time soon 

""These are businesses that have strong prospects and that we feel have good potential, but we'll need to look at each carefully,"" he said. 

The company's central businesses of energy and gas trading are not expected to be cut back significantly, Whalley said, and should remain intact until the merger. Despite reports that many employees are leaving those business groups, company officials have said repeatedly that is not the case and that top employees are being retained. A stipulation of the Dynegy-Enron merger agreement prevents Dynegy from recruiting or hiring Enron staff for a certain period, in case the purchase is not completed. 

The $8 billion in business units that could be sold in the coming year do not include Portland General Electric, the Oregon power company that was already under contract to sell for $2.9 billion next year. Nor do they include about $800 million in asset sales that are expected to close by year's end, Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said. That includes about $250 million for a Brazilian gas distribution business, $266 million for a power plant in Puerto Rico and $332 million for certain offshore energy properties in India. 

The company did not file a final version of its third-quarter financial statement Wednesday as previously expected but rather said it would be five days late with the document. Enron did, however, share some more details about some of its financing partnerships, including the Marlin and Osprey investment vehicles. 

Marlin is a vehicle created to acquire Azurix, an Enron unit that owns British water utility Wessex. It has over $900 million of debt that's due in July 2003. McMahon said that if the value of Wessex is 25 percent below its current book value of $2.6 billion when Marlin's debt falls due, this would result in a charge of $650 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Osprey was created to acquire energy assets and other assets, and has $2.4 billion of debt that falls due in January 2003. McMahon said that if the Osprey assets were valued at less than 25 percent of their current book value when the debt falls due it would result in a charge of $600 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Analysts asked repeatedly if executives were confident that no other surprise liabilities were hiding in the books, referring to the $1 billion in equity write-downs the company reported last quarter due to several off-balance-sheet financing deals, and a restatement of 4 1/2 years of financial statements to include an additional $600 million in losses. 

McMahon said the company has gone through the books carefully, but he noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission and a special committee of the Enron board of directors were still conducting their own investigations. 

""Everything we know, you now know,"" Lay told the analysts. 

Lay said the fourth-quarter results are expected to be hampered by severance and restructuring costs, however, but couldn't provide more details. He said the company is also seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity investments.

Subject:	Gas Supply proposal for EDF

Hello Tom, I hope bid week is over, and you can breathe now?I met PACE Global Energy yesterday to talk about the EDF RFP, and I think it looks much better now:

1.- Term: They are planning on having 3 interconnections into 3 different pipelines (Tetco, PG&E and Coral Mexico Pipeline), so they think the banks can get comfortable with less than 25 years of supply, because the 3 interconnections lowers their risk of not getting fuel supply in the future. They are asking now to a proposal of minimum 5 years, and upto 12 if we can make it. So they will be taking the risk of not having a fuel supply that matches de 25 year Power Purchase Agreement.

2.- The Points of Sale will be in the U.S. Mexico Border, so we will not have to get an export permit of any sort.

3.- Swing: This is going to be a base load plant, that will be dispatched around 90% on a yearly average.  However CFE has the right to take zero power at their full discretion, so Edf does not wsant to take the risk of not being dispatched and not being able to swing down to zero during the 25 years of the gas supply.  However, the plant will most certainly displace other less efficient plants in the first 10 years, so that such risk is much lower. In our proposal we can include either zero swing or which ever we feel we are the most competitive. They will evaluate whether such risk could be taken by them. 

4.- Modifying Swing every 2 years.  They believe that in the long run (25 years), the dispatching rules or conditions of the plant could change. So they want to have the option to review the swing every 2 years. Can we price this optionality ? Is there a re-purchase of such optionality in the market ? 

5.- Resale formula. They need us to include a daily re-sale fomula for the gas not taken.

6.- Other Provisions: We need to review the other provisions in the RFP and tell them which ones can we comply with and which ones we don't. 

I am faxing you the entire RFP, together with the latest letter we received from them. Please give me a call whenevr you have a chance.   

Best regards.

Tom, here's a short version of the vacation hours that everyone has REMAINING.  Just FYI, I went ahead and included everyone on the desk.  I've also included a spreadsheet that I downloaded from SAP, which shows more detail.  It is shown in hours, as well.  Let me know if you need anything else!  

Laura

Eric Bass  -  88 hrs vacation remaining
Dave Baumbach  -  80 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
Gary Bryan  -  160 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
JD Buss  -  120 hrs vac remaining
Daren Farmer  -  68 hrs vac remaining
Bryan Hull  -  128 hrs vac remaining
Mark Knippa  -  152 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
Tom Martin  -  104 hrs vac remaining
Mike Olsen  -  96 hrs vac remaining
Joe Parks  -  96 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
Jim Schwieger  -  0 hrs vac remaining
Jay Smith  -  30 hrs vac remaining
Laura Vuittonet  -  71 hrs vac remaining
Charlie Weldon  -  60 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet

One more thing ... the report does not include vacation taken between the dates of November 1st thru November 15th.  The November 15th pay period is when I enter that information, so SAP does not have it yet.  I corrected the email for those who have taken vacation during this pay period (so far), which were Charlie, Joe, Eric, Mark, and you.  

Also, Dave's vacation is not appearing in SAP, so the report shows NONE of his vacation time.  He and I talked about this, and he has 8 days remaining.  I am going to correct his vacation time in SAP.

As we discussed the other day, there are several key commercial, logistics, risk management and gas control personnel that we must have to run our business this winter.  I have heard that some of our people are being pursued by outside companies in light of the potential HPL sale.  The key people that we want to ensure stay around through the transition are:

Ed Gottlob
Elsa Villareal
James McKay
Gary Hanks
Darren Farmer
Stacey Neuweiler
Pat Clines
Dave Baumbach

Tom, does your group have any dealings with Acacia Natural Gas?  It's a Texas intrastate owned by Mitchell.  They have made a filing for approval of Section 311 rates for interruptible service and they have set up their Operating Conditions so their affiliate will get higher priority over other parties who are paying the same rate (priority within the same rate will be based on whoever has the earliest transportation agreement).

Would appreciate hearing from you in the next day or so.  Comments are due on the filing by Nov. 7th, and if we want to protest, we'll have to get our facts together.

Thanks.

Mr. Martin,

I wanted to take a moment this morning to provide you an update on your recent ESOP change request.  I have received confirmation from Corporate Benefits that your form has been received.  Unfortunately due to current switch over of our Savings vendor, which was also the vendor for our ESOP program, we are still experimenting the blackout period on any savings plan activity through November 20th.  

Also, I wanted to point out my error with the processing of your form.  Since this was a very old stock program form, I accidentally confused it for an enrollment form to our direct service program, which is the program that allows employees to purchase stock through payroll deduction twice a month.  In a nutshell, I accidentally forwarded your form to the incorrect resource and then had to re-route it to the correct group which is our corporate contact for the 401(K) savings plan.  

I apologize for the delay in providing you with this update and am extremely sorry for my mistake.   Please let me know if there is anything that I can do asides from following up with Corporate benefits after the blackout period to check on the status of your request and then I will provide your asst, Laura with an update.

Tom, does anyone in our group have a Bloomberg account?  I am going to send in a request for a list of all of the applications that each person in our group has, including Market Data applications.  I think that this is information that I should have.  Until then ... should I forward a copy of this email to everyone in the group?

All,

To ensure a smooth transfer to Enron Center South we must notify Bloomberg of all Bloomberg accounts moving over this weekend. Market Data needs to know who is currently using Bloomberg in your group. 

Please reply with the names of the people in your group currently using Bloomberg. Please reply if there is no one in your group is using Bloomberg.

Thank you,

Hey Tom,
Rita Wynne just called and let me know that we need to make a payment to TXU on behalf of Tenaska.  Since TXU has terminated agreements with us, the Cash Management Committee will not make payments to TXU unless they understand the deal that is in place with Tenaska and we show that Tenaska has already paid us their part.  Could you please help Chip Schneider, of Enron Underwriting, and myself get up to speed on this as quickly as possible.  TXU is threatening to take action on Tenaska.  Thanks for your help.

I know the origination was classified as Gas Assets but their transaction count was included in our budget since all of their pricing is structured in our group.  If those transactions are not included in our count then our middle marketing transaction targets for the 1st and 2nd quarters need to move to Gas Assets.  Ask Eddie and Laynie how they want to handle it.

John,

You or Greg need to address the various groups with whatever generic information you can as to where we are in the process, expected timeline, hurdles before start up again, starting VAR and general organizational structure.  People are moving from frustration to feeling insulted that they are expected to sit still with no information.  I know you have a lot on your plate but if we really want people to hang in there a little longer before we address each individual's situation they need some sense of when they can expect closure.

Sure sounds to me that Ken is in the same shoes as the rest of us regarding the downfall of ENE.  
What do you think????????????????????????
Wouldn't you think the honorable thing would be to refuse any compensation knowing your terrible performance? 
I'm sorry! I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait!

The wording of ""If he terminates his employment within 60 days of a change of control"" sure sounds to me like someone knew what was going on to me?
I guess we should have kept in mind the 2nd definition of LAY in the dictionary is ""To put to rest""

 DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an ""excess
parachute payment,"" according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days. 
  Houston-based Enron is a utilities and communications company. -Dan Lowrey;

I am sorry that you are having problems with Shanna.  I am proud that you
are doing the right thing and welcoming a new person at school.  It can be
very dificult to be the new kid at a new school.  It sounds like Shanna
feels threaten by you and others being friendly to this new girl.  I know
it is hard but some how you need to reassure Shanna that you being nice to
the new girl does not mean she (Shanna) is less of your friend.  Maybe the
best approach is to ask Shanna how she would feel if she had to move to a
new school and was treated badly by some of the new girls she met.  You and
Shanna have been friends for a long time and you don't want to lose that,
but she needs to know that you will continue to welcome new kids that come
school and it does not impact your friendship with her.
To answer your question, things are OK.  There is still a lot of
uncertainty with the Dynegy and Enron merger and it is not going to be
fixed any time soon.  All I can do is try to do the best job I can and let
everything else work itself out.
I am going to an NWAL meeting tonight at 7:30 so I will see you probably
about bed time.
Thanks for writing to me.

David,

I made a few adjustments to your expense estimates based on a more detail look at actuals in 2001 and my previous 2002 budget.  The total impact is to increase the budget by $68,000.  I also was not sure what your Rent, Technology and Transportation amounts were supposed to represent.  Based on our previous discussions I thought that rent and technology are covered elsewhere, but I used your numbers anyway.  I am interested in what that is supposed to be since it is not very much and those are potentially very large dollar categories if everything gets rolled in.

Call me if you have any questions.

I wanted to let you know that I sent Elsa some flowers to her house yesterday.  Danny Conner said that she had surgery, and he suggested that I do that.  So just in case she calls to say ""thank you,"" you'll know!  I hope she hasn't already done that, now that I think about it!!

"RE: CHAD - Attorney Client Privlege - Confidential","If this truly cleans out the closet then it is worth it.  The potential upside of the Entex Audit is more like $2 - $3 million but our ability to recover that much is questionable given the weak contract language for resolving non-performance.  In the past ENA and Entex resolved volume shortfalls under the term contract by extending the term.  Obviously we will not have that remedy.  Do not let AEP separate other issues away from this and try to pick us to death.

Confidential - Attorney Client Privlege

Please give me your thoughts on the attached proposal to resolve the ""dangling chads"" with AEP.  I have attached the proposal and a ""value analysis"" of the proposal, both of which I propose to send to AEP.  The key benefits of the proposal from Enron's perspective are the following:

1.	Removes us from the vagueness and uncapped exposure of the Ducote deal with Entex for additional costs.  AEP can capture the economics of future gas deliveres to Entex associated with this capital expenditure.

2.	Captures the leverage that AEP will have in the Entex audit.  I think for ENA to pursue Entex would be difficult/time consuming and may lead to a tortious interference suit from AEP.

3.	Gives up the interest payment we think AEP owes us.  This is true value we are giving up, but do we really want to fight with AEP in court over this (to the extent they are not bluffing)?

4.	Removes us from having to process imbalances - saving manpower costs and further removing us from hassles with AEP.  AEP is better able to capture value from these imbalances then we are, since they have the pipe.

5.	Gets us out of the Coastline law suit.  I'm pretty sure Coastline is at least owed the $1.4MM that we would contribute.  AEP has a chance to minimize any further costs, which are capped by the value of the claim at a further $2.2MM.

Please do not circulate this.

Thanks,
Brian

Tom,

Michael Salinas is planning the Christmas Card Signing Party.  It looks like it's going to be at Cabo's THIS MONDAY, December 3rd at 5:00.  

I assume that we will be splitting the cost, but I guess I really shouldn't assume because of everything the company is going through right now.  Michael estimates the total cost to be $1000, making your half $500.  Let me know what you think.

Also, are there any customers (for the trading side) that we need to be sure are included to receive Christmas cards?  

Thanks,

Hi Tom,

Thanks for talking to me last night about Enron and their different
associate opportunities. Below is the description I found about the HR
Associate/Analyst Program on Enron's web site
(http://www4.enron.com/corp/jobs/recruiting/program.html):

HR ASSOCIATE/ANALYST PROGRAM

Enron's Human Resources Associate & Analyst Program is designed to identify
and groom the best people to become future leaders in their chosen field.
Through their rotations, Associates and Analysts have the opportunity learn
our business, become acclimated to our corporate culture and contribute to
our growth.

Graduates
For the Associate program, Enron seeks individuals with an advanced degree;
at least 2 years' work experience (not necessarily HR); and an
entrepreneurial spirit. Associates are expected to assume active roles of
responsibility in development of the HR function, working independently or
on teams. Rotations are for 6 months each, with promotion to HR Manager
being purely merit based. Business Unit rotations will afford you an
opportunity to gain insight into the business and staffing needs of Enron.
HR rotations are designed to develop your generalist, consulting, and
leadership skills.

The contact person listed is Karen Buckley (713.345.4667).  My resume is
also attached. My HR experience was prior to graduate school. I worked at
Vinson & Elkins as their Interim Litigation Coordinator from 1994-1996 and
The University of Michigan, where I was a Department Manager from 1992-1994.

Thanks so much for helping me Tom; I really appreciate it. Also, if you
have any advice about my resume or need any additional information, you can
reach me at home (713.868.9464), my cell (832.444.2229) or this email. I'm
online most of the day.

Thanks again and I'll wait to hear back from you.

Sherrie

Enron plans asset sell-off to slash debt 


'We made some very bad investments,' Lay admits 

By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 

Enron Corp. officials admitted they made serious investment errors in recent years and will step up the pace of selling off those investments, including its broadband services group and some international operations.

Those business units, which are worth as much as $8 billion, could be sold off or spun out over the next year, the company said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. That would bring in more cash to pay down debt and trim away money-losing operations. 

Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay surprised many with a blunt assessment of the company's poor judgment in recent years that led to the rapid implosion of the energy trading giant's reputation and value in the past month. 

""In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,"" Lay said. ""The negative impact of these investments has been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet. We fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence."" 

To help make the cuts, the company is breaking its businesses into three groups: those that are the most profitable and part of its core business, such as energy and gas trading; those that are unprofitable and nonessential, such as overseas power plants; and those that have good profit potential in the near future that are under review, such as its steel, pulp and paper-trading operations. 

The noncore operations will be sold or closed down in an orderly fashion in the next year, said President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley. Those operations under review will be studied to see if they can contribute to the company's bottom line any time soon 

""These are businesses that have strong prospects and that we feel have good potential, but we'll need to look at each carefully,"" he said. 

The company's central businesses of energy and gas trading are not expected to be cut back significantly, Whalley said, and should remain intact until the merger. Despite reports that many employees are leaving those business groups, company officials have said repeatedly that is not the case and that top employees are being retained. A stipulation of the Dynegy-Enron merger agreement prevents Dynegy from recruiting or hiring Enron staff for a certain period, in case the purchase is not completed. 

The $8 billion in business units that could be sold in the coming year do not include Portland General Electric, the Oregon power company that was already under contract to sell for $2.9 billion next year. Nor do they include about $800 million in asset sales that are expected to close by year's end, Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said. That includes about $250 million for a Brazilian gas distribution business, $266 million for a power plant in Puerto Rico and $332 million for certain offshore energy properties in India. 

The company did not file a final version of its third-quarter financial statement Wednesday as previously expected but rather said it would be five days late with the document. Enron did, however, share some more details about some of its financing partnerships, including the Marlin and Osprey investment vehicles. 

Marlin is a vehicle created to acquire Azurix, an Enron unit that owns British water utility Wessex. It has over $900 million of debt that's due in July 2003. McMahon said that if the value of Wessex is 25 percent below its current book value of $2.6 billion when Marlin's debt falls due, this would result in a charge of $650 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Osprey was created to acquire energy assets and other assets, and has $2.4 billion of debt that falls due in January 2003. McMahon said that if the Osprey assets were valued at less than 25 percent of their current book value when the debt falls due it would result in a charge of $600 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Analysts asked repeatedly if executives were confident that no other surprise liabilities were hiding in the books, referring to the $1 billion in equity write-downs the company reported last quarter due to several off-balance-sheet financing deals, and a restatement of 4 1/2 years of financial statements to include an additional $600 million in losses. 

McMahon said the company has gone through the books carefully, but he noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission and a special committee of the Enron board of directors were still conducting their own investigations. 

""Everything we know, you now know,"" Lay told the analysts. 

Lay said the fourth-quarter results are expected to be hampered by severance and restructuring costs, however, but couldn't provide more details. He said the company is also seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity investments.

Gary,


I don't think that we will be using a weather hedge this season.  The hedges that we have used before have worked well because we have had very warm winters and have correlated very well with Entex takes.  I am not as confident in the correlation in a closer to normal temperature environment which is the forecast for this winter.

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

"Dave Baumbach","Jeff,

I could be in a tough situation at the desk with personnel.  Right now Daren Farmer is evaluating an opportunity with AEP.  If he stays and if we get pressure for another round of cuts; I may be in a situation that I have to do something with Dave.  If Daren leaves then Dave is really the only one remaining with Waha experience, that is why I decided to move him to the desk.  Bottom line to me is that based on discussions with you in the past and my experience, Dave is definitely a keeper for Risk and has gained some physical experience in the last six months that will help me out particularly if Daren leaves.  Needless to say there are a lot of variables to manage here but I thought you should be aware it, particularly if I end up in a situation where I have to make more cuts.

I am sure you are in a similar situation with some of your folks so you can probably relate to what I am going through.  I will catch up with you as this unfolds but if possible don't completely put Dave out of your plans at this point.  I have explained this situation to him and I think he understands given he is new to trading.

Any thoughts?

Mr. Martin, 

As you can see from the e-mail address, I am now an Enron employee.  After we had last spoke, in November, I was contacted by the Analyst program and I asked them to keep my name in the database, just in case an opportunity were to arrive.  In April I got a call out of the blue asking if I was still interested.  I did have to think about the decision a little bit, but I figure that the opportunities for me here greatly out numbered those at Coral.  I accepted and as of April, 30, I am here in the East Power Fundamentals group on the 31st floor. 

I just wanted to give you an update, and I thank you again for helping me get into the Analyst program!

Subject:	Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum - June 20, 2001

Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate in an Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to those who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past few years.  These informal, interactive forums will be approximately 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.  

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although attendance is not mandatory, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do ""reality checks"", create a ""rallying point"" and ensure Enron's executive management is on the ""same page"" about where Enron is going---and why.

We realize that individuals based outside the United States will not want to make a special trip to attend the meeting, but may be able to attend one of the sessions while they are in Houston on other business.  We also hope to schedule a similar session in London later this year.

We currently have a session planned for:

Wednesday, June 20, 2001 from 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Houston, EB50M

The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here's how it will work:
?	Each session will have approximately 25 participants.
?	The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
?	This will be your forum. Don't expect to simply sit and listen to presentations.
?	This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own questions and express your own opinions.
?	You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum.
?	Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not limited to: the
direction of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activities, projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we encourage you to accept this invitation only if you intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do the same.  We also ask that you refrain from canceling your attendance once enrolled so that we will not have to cancel the forum.  The Office of the Chairman is very willing to take valuable time from their busy schedules to hold these forums.  Enrollments will be on a first come first served basis and we hope you would be able to honor your commitment to attend.  For planning purposes, it is essential that you RSVP no later than Monday, June 11, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586.

We will confirm your registration with you, in writing and forward a list of enrollees to the Office of the Chairman.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson via e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806.  

Thank you.

"RE: The Maple Leaves","Louise,

I asked Tammie to call the presenters to make sure of their availability.  I also talked to Mari and she is trying to find a bigger room given the size of this group.  She indicated that approximately half the group will review documents and the other half will participate in the presentations.

Margaret,
 
Tom is planning to go on Sunday morning the 16th.  He said he will plan to leave in time for us to leave out here for the symphony.  He told your Mom if it runs a long time, he might have to leave before they serve lunch.  He said he may have to pick your parents up that morning to give them a ride.  I  can pick up Krista when we leave for the symphony.  Would it be easiest if we just meet you and your Mom at the symphony?  You could leave our tickets with Krista so we would have them when we pick her up.  Is the time 2:30 or 3:00?

"June Bidweek Procedures (additional)","An issue has come up that I did not consider in my prior discussions of how bidweek for June should be managed prior to knowing if we close or not.  Physical deals for June have started to happen already.  If close does occur and all the deals prior to May 18th are done as HPL then ENA will miss out on a lot of potential business for June.  So I believe a fair solution is to have all deals in locations that are most relevant to HPL (ie. Agua Dulce, Thompsonville, Oasis Katy, Lonestar Katy, Texoma) be done as HPL; deals in a location such as Katy Tailgate that is relevant to HPL and ENA will be split evenly HPL and ENA and written up as two separate purchases.  Waha is not considered here since AEP already has a Waha trader who is active in the market.

Subject:	HPL Transportation and Storage

Patrick,

I forwarded the information regarding the variable costs of transportation to Ed McMichael as you requested.  The storage has no forward value, it was included to take advantage of opportunities as they occur.  I want to be clear AGAIN about how the transportation transaction should be accrual upside and not booked as MTM as our view is that the spreads will compress over time and any spread value that exists from the curves today will likely go away or be significantly reduced over time .  I thought Lavorado was very clear that he did not want to book MTM value against these deals.  Am I missing something?

"Chris Germany","
I am losing my Logistics Manager/Transportation person, Daren Farmer to AEP.  I have talked to Chris Germany about this opportunity and he would like to do this job.  Does this create any problems for you?  Given the current uncertainty about NETCO headcount and considering any transition issues you may have with Chris leaving, I thought we should leave things the way they are for now but develop a transfer date to be in a week or two.  If you are OK with this move, I would like Chris to spend part of his time next week downloading from Daren as I have him through next Friday.

On another matter, I believe Daren has E-mailed you about an agency agreement that we have with Cleburne Plant that needs to be transitioned to the estate.  He knows the details as does Rick Hill (I believe he is in your group).  We should probably get someone else in your group plugged into this deal (Kathy Kelly?), to handle to the administration of this deal.  We should try to identify someone quickly so that he/she can download from Daren next week.

"Texas Gas Origination","
Rob,

Lavo has given me the idea that Brian Redmond may not be part of NETCO and it is possible that the Texas Gas Origination business may go away completely.  I would like to talk to you before you make a final decision.  I do not see it as a big money generator but similar to the East and Central it is a source of information for the trading business.  It is even more imperative to have a couple of people talking to producers and customers in Texas because pipeline flow data is not accessible as it is in the interstate market.  My opinion is if you had one person covering the producers and one covering the customers that would give us adequate coverage for information and make a little orig in the process.  Give me a call to discuss at 713-853-3079.

Enron has the right to  buy it back by June 30th.  Enron will still proceed with the 10 billion wrongfull termination of merger suit and include NNG in that suit.  Bottom line for now NNG employees will become Dynegy employees until this other suit is resolved and/or unless Enron excercises its right to buy it back.  I wonder if this will impact Eric and Wendy?

I would like to have a 2 hour team building session for the assistants, receptionists, and clerks on Friday 5/25/01.  The only thing that will be charged to your cost center is the cost of a lunch brought in for the administrative staff.  

I know that the assistants usually are out of here between 12:30 to 1:30 being that this is a Friday before a holiday.   I would like to have the session start at 12:30 so that they can still be out of here by 2:30 that day.  This would require the phones being on solo pilot starting at 12:30.

Please respond with your approval, questions and/or comments as soon as time permits so I can set everything up this week.

Many thanks,

"RE: Dave B","I understand the control concern but it sure would allow us to be more efficient since Texas is small and clean (probably not a full time manager job).  He has not and will not be taking risk positions (at least not initially) he has been and will be trading our daily Waha phyical volumes.  If he evolved to a point where we wanted him to take risk positions we then could move him out of Risk.  What do you think?

If you don't think this will work let me know, but in that scenario I guess I would say don't count on Dave.  I guess I will have to move him into the Associate program or Logistics.  I we go down that road then I feel like I need to run this by Dave since he effectively will be cutting his ties to Risk and taking some career risk.  I am sure if it does not work out you or some other company would welcome Dave in a risk role.  Let me know what you think or just call me and we can get together.

I can not see anyway they will go for having someone in a controls role, trading.  Also,  I will have lost about 30% of my staff by the time all is said and done, and will need every person on a full time basis.  I do not mind losing Dave since I have not had him in months,  so if we want to put him in logistics or some other function that reports up through commercial,  I would not have any problem with that.

Per our phone conversation Enron agrees to buy back 21,417/d at Carthage for December at IFGMR HSC index - .08.  I have also talked to EPrime who is our supplier and they are buying back this 21,417/d from Enron at IFGMR HSC - .08.  They will subsequently sell the gas to Woodward directly at IFGMR HSC - .08.  Both EPrime and Woodward agree that HSC - .08 is a fair market value for Carthage volumes during bidweek for December.  The purpose of this transaction is to mitigate the risk of physical non-performance by Enron given our current financial condition without impacting the contractual pricing of the deals previously done with Eprime and Woodward respectively.

Tom, want me to start ordering lunches just for our group?  I could even take specific orders for what each person likes, and have them bill us or put it on someone's credit card.  I can do that for just the EOL guys, too.  I found out that the deliveries are going to ECN, and the clerks are picking them up from there.  Well, at lunchtime, I could take a dollie with me to carry it all, and/or have Michael Salinas help me.  I don't know ... whatever you'd like.  That's just a suggestion that I have, if you would still like to pull away from the daily lunches for the whole floor.  I've noticed a lot of our guys don't like the lunches, and they sometimes go get food from the Energizer.  We still get billed for their food, even if they don't eat.  

Let me know if you'd still like to do this, because it's definitely possible.

(And no  one was voted off!!)  Jalapeno's has a nice brunch every  Sunday.
 
Six of our group  will have to leave at 2 PM to attend a play nearby.
 
PLEASE RSVP soon so  that accurate reservations can be made.

I would like to go ahead and request some days off for the upcoming holidays, if it is still possible.

Wed, October 31st
Wed, November 21st
Fri, December 21st
Wed, December 26th

I realized how much vacation I have remaining, and I might as well see if I can get off these days if there's coverage.  I guess just let me know how it all turns out.

Tom ... I've ordered boxes, and they should be here sometime this afternoon.  It would probably be a good idea to have everything packed before you leave today.  I talked with Delores Sustaita w/the Move Team, and she said that they typically start around 9:00 ... but that might not necessarily be the time that you are moved tomorrow.  She said that they cannot guarantee when which group will be moved, and suggested that the groups not come in since you more than likely won't be able to log in to our computers for most of the day.  What do you think?

"RE: David Baumbach","Maybe we should meet.  I am not sure what Dave has told you but my intent is for at least the near term that his responsiblities not change.  My objective in moving him on the desk is to provide an opportunity for him to have a better perspective in what we do.  I told him that as he has time I could utilize him for analysis or other projects but not at the expense of his current job.  The bottom line is that Dave is very good at his current role and he has expressed interest in trading.  I viewed this move as an opportunity to evaluate his trading potential while he is given the opportunity to see what trading is really like;  but I have no immediate plans to move Dave into trading.  If the time ever comes that I would like bring him into trading I will certainly coordinate the transition with you.  I was under the impression that Dave cleared all this with you before he moved.  It appears that he may have made this physical move more meaningful than it is and certainly more than I intend at this time.  How do you want to handle this?

"Texas Trading 2002 Expense Budget","David,

I made a few adjustments to your expense estimates based on a more detail look at actuals in 2001 and my previous 2002 budget.  The total impact is to increase the budget by $68,000.  I also was not sure what your Rent, Technology and Transportation amounts were supposed to represent.  Based on our previous discussions I thought that rent and technology are covered elsewhere, but I used your numbers anyway.  I am interested in what that is supposed to be since it is not very much and those are potentially very large dollar categories if everything gets rolled in.

Call me if you have any questions.

currently ENA has a transport agreement on Oasis.  This agreement will not be assigned.

Not use AEP has an agreement on Oasis.  Just to make sure, I would recommend we

It seems like we would have approximately the same cost for air at Klein

up from last year and does that make it too expensive to have air.  Who

Hello from Inside FERC,

Tomorrow (Friday) is the last business day of September, and it's the final
deadline for Inside FERC's Gas Market Report's October 2001 bidweek
spot-price survey.

Attached is an Excel workbook (IFMONTH2.XLS) to report your price data in.

Please take a moment to review the instructions at the top of the file. They
specify what kinds of deals to report and -- more importantly -- what deals
NOT to report.

Please note that a significant portion of our survey respondents are
reporting counterparties with their deals.  We want you to too. Please list
counterparties in the ""comments"" column. Counterparty information is held in
confidence and not shared with third parties.

Reported deals with counterparty information are treated as more reliable
than trades without.

Please make sure to add the name of a contact person for your company and a
telephone number to reach them with at the top of your price file.

When you are done, e-mail the price workbooks back to both
kelley_doolan@platts.com and MHENERGY@YAHOO.COM by 1:00 PM (Central), on
Friday, Sept. 28.

October monthly prices will be published on Monday, Oct. 1.

As always, thanks for your help, and if you have any questions, please feel
free to call or e-mail me at the number/address below.

Best regards, and I hope you and yours are safe,


Kelley Doolan, chief editor

I will need 1 senior analyst and possibly could fill some of my cash trading needs with an additional associate.  I have talked to Bryan Hull (third year analyst) about a one year rotation at our desk.  He spent his first rotation in the Texas Risk Group and did a great job.  His second rotation has been in the EOL Marketing Group.  He is interested in trading and is a sharp guy.

I like the air too.  Polling our board, they are spit on which pool but as
Jeff pointed out the kids can start from the starting blocks instead of the
bulkhead (which does affect their times).  That was an issue for several
teams when we were setting up a Klein Oak last year.  We should all talk
about whether to request the gym and the additional cost of doing so.  The
pool fees have increased since last year.  You can shoot an email to Jeff
and the other teams about the idea if you like.

also get their gym so we can have the teams set up in there.  It is not
as conveniently located to the pool as Klein Oak's gym is but at least
it keeps the teams out of the sun for the day.  What do you think?

"Re: Guadalupe Power Partners LP","
Yes, this deal should go to AEP with the HPL transaction.  The reason there are no forward volumes booked is because they have a monthly election to nominate baseload gas daily priced gas or wait and nominate daily volumes priced at gas daily.  At any rate there is no way to know in forward months what they are going to take subject to contractual maximums.  If you have any further questions let me know.

Subject:	Bammel Working Gas Sale To AEP

As of today May 9, 2001 Bammel has working gas of approximately 20.3 TBTU.  Economics are favorable to keep injecting.  I estimate that injections will average around 1TBTU per week through May 31, 2001 which would result in another 3+ TBTU beibng injected.  At the current pricing level this means that AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million.  Is this something Accounting should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001?  Should AEP be notified of the volume and approximate value.  Is there anything that needs to be done contractually other than the original agrrement to facilitate this transaction?  I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware!  Please let me know your thoughts.

Subject:	Leaving Early Wed

Tom, would it be all right with you if I left early tomorrow?  My husband is leaving early (3:30) for his dentist appointment tomorrow afternoon in Pearland, and it would just make things easier for me to go home with him because my sister-in-law is having her baby tomorrow as well (she's being induced).  I figure I can swing by and pick up the kids while my husband is at the dentist, then pick up my husband, then be on our way to the hospital to see our new niece/cousin.  

Yeah, I know it's complicated and probably more detailed than you needed to know.  I just wasn't sure how to tell you why I'd like to leave early tomorrow!

"RE: Inside FERC survey reminder and price file","Kelley,

Given our financial situation we did not do any fixed price physical transactions for December so we have no trades to report this month.  Hopefully our situation we be resolved soon so that we can be a part of the process in the near future.  For whatever it is worth, it that there are some unusual things happening in the ""Fixed Float"" markets in Texas particularily at HSC.  The NYMEX is down 10 cents today yet the HSC fixed float market went from plus 2 cents or $2.336 to $2.345 yesterday to now $2.36 with the Henry Hub also appearing to be inflated by maintaining a fixed float value of $2.31 again in a falling market.  We feel like we are defenseless because we have no trades to report and yet have basis and Gas Daily positions and some trade players know it so they are inflating the prices to hurt us more financially.  I have no evidence since I was not a participant in the fixed price physical market this month all I am asking is that you be extra vigilant in determining the validity of the transactions that are being submitted for index consideration.

Thank you,

Tom Martin

"RE: Pay Statement","I have it in my briefcase, I just forgot to get it out.  Another slow day so far.

I checked on the internet today about FannieMae and GinnieMae per Lisa's comments the other day.  I learned that GinnieMae is a government owned company that buys and sells mortgages for HUD and FHA loans.  They are basically the financing vehicle for these low income housing loans.  FannieMae basically does the same thing but is a non-government owned company (used to be government owned in 1967).  Both entities have had a history of financing the rebuilding of rundown urban areas in cities accross the country.  So Lisa's friend/relative used these entities in the correct way but who knows if there is any truth to their future involvement in our area.  Based on some of the stories I read they tend to focus on really bad areas.  My guess is that on an individual house perspective these two entities provide a mechanism to resale low income housing mortages in the secondary market.  So to the extent there are HUD or FHA loans in our neighborhood they are probably involved in the ultimate financing of these loans but that is it.  I had no idea what these two entities did, kind of interesting.

John,

You or Greg need to address the various groups with whatever generic information you can as to where we are in the process, expected timeline, hurdles before start up again, starting VAR and general organizational structure.  People are moving from frustration to feeling insulted that they are expected to sit still with no information.  I know you have a lot on your plate but if we really want people to hang in there a little longer before we address each individual's situation they need some sense of when they can expect closure.

I generally am pretty flexible regarding vacation as long as there is coverage.  I am not sure that after we become UBS if vacation carryover will happen; my guess is that you will receive vacation based only on your years of service with Enron.  Do you know the answer to that queston?  If not I will find out for you.  Given the size of our group now, it will be hard for you and Mike to take four weeks of vacation after we start up again.  I would encourage you guys to take some now before things get busy.  Let's talk.

"RE: Tenaska Service Agreement","We can try.  The guy who managed this deal for the desk left the Company but I thought he handed it off to Rick Hill in the estate.  I will talk to the rest of the guys on the desk and find out what we have on it and call you.  My basic understanding of this deal is that we provided services only and are agent for the plant.  I believe Rick Hill is the commercial contact on the deal so he should be able to provide more insight to the whole deal.  I will get back to you.

Hey Tom,
Rita Wynne just called and let me know that we need to make a payment to TXU on behalf of Tenaska.  Since TXU has terminated agreements with us, the Cash Management Committee will not make payments to TXU unless they understand the deal that is in place with Tenaska and we show that Tenaska has already paid us their part.  Could you please help Chip Schneider, of Enron Underwriting, and myself get up to speed on this as quickly as possible.  TXU is threatening to take action on Tenaska.  Thanks for your help.

"RE: Lunch Budget","Maybe the next step is to dig into the allocation methodology that Daniel uses to see if it assumes the correct number of people.  Then convert the monthly allocation amount to a cost per person and do the same for your other analysis so we can compare apples to apples.  When you combine origination and trading we are likely to exceed 15 people.  My guess is that we are being allocated costs based on too many people (Pre HPL Sale).

Subject:	Lunch Budget

 << File: Lunch Estimate.xls >> 
Tom, I probably should have explained what my problems are, and why it took me so long to get this to you.  Daniel is the person in charge of the lunches, and he has not had an opportunity to prepare the monthly spreadsheets for August and September, which show the total amounts per day, and how much each cost center is charged.  He's come up with a percentage, according to how many total people he orders for, then according to how many people are in each group, and he charges each cost center accordingly.  I've attached the 2 worksheets that he's provided me, which are for June and July, however there were fewer people in our group because since then he has added Brian Redmond and his group to our budget.  Daniel is working on preparing the spreadsheets for August and September.  I've told Ina that I'm needing them for a project for you, so I'm sure that they will be ready soon.  

I thought that I could just look at what's been charged to our cost center each month, but it was too difficult to figure out which invoices were from which lunch because they don't always hit the cost center the month during or after they were invoiced.  They are also sometimes charged on a credit card and then billed in a huge lump sum.  

I've simply made a spreadsheet showing selected restaurants and the average price of what we've been charged for June and July, and then I've shown what it will cost for 15 people to eat if we order it separately.  I've included tips and delivery charges, since we're billed for those as well.  

Let's talk about it tomorrow.

"HPL Bidweek procedures","
It is my understanding that five AEP employees will in Enron's offices starting May 15th or 16th to get a better understanding of how to do the HPL trading and to direct the HPL bidweek activities for June (assuming close occurs for June).  To protect Enron's proprietary trading information for May and June I would like the AEP employees not to be allowed in the offices until after 10:30 AM for the duration of their stay.  From 7:30 - 10:30 AM is when the May business occurs and it is also when the communication occurs with HPL employees.

Another issue is what happens if we believe that close is going to occur June 1 and then late in bidweek it gets delayed until July;  who wears the risk positions?  My suggestion is that if AEP is going to set up HPL activities for June then they should wear the risk positions.  The way to accomplish this is to do the following:

	1.  The initial core term index physical position plus all thirty day index deals will be swapped out at gas daily index at the nearest relevant gas daily index 	     point (ie. HSC or Waha) after considering any volumes to be targeted for storage injections.

	2.  Volumes targeted for storage injections up to 400,000/d purchased on IFGMR HSC index related pricing will be sold to AEP in the ground at June index 	     + actual storage costs.  Volumes targeted for storage are those volumes that can phyically get to Bammel storage.

Examples

Case 1
Core term index position    100,000/d long  (50,000/d Waha, 50,000/d Texoma)
Thirty day index position    200,000/d long  (volumes at Thompsonville and Katy)
Total Index Position           300,000/d long

Vols. targeted for storage   200,000/d

Enron sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.  Any additional volumes would be sold to AEP at July index.  Enron sells 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR Waha and 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR HSC.

Case 2
Core term index position     200,000 short (50,000/d Waha, 150,000/d HSC)
Thirty day index position     400,000 long   (50,000/d Waha, 100,000/d Agua Dulce, 100,000/d Thompsonville, 150,000/d Katy)
Total Index Position            200,000 long

Vols. targeted for storage    200,000/d

Enron sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.

Lyne,

I have 108 hours of vacation left and wanted your input as to how to use some of it.  I will carry over 40 hours to next year.  We are off Christmas Eve.  I was thinking of taking 11/19 off since I have that doctor appointment.  Otherwise maybe 3 to 5 days the first two weeks of December will work.  I may be able to take a half day or two at other times if there is something special you want me to do.

Can you guys please prepare a coordinated list of no more than 35 people that can come in on Sunday between 2- 6:00 pm to test trading applications.  Due to the combination of the moves (over 900 people) the IT group wants to ensure that your applications are functioning properly before Monday morning.  

The list should be weighted heavier towards those folks who can identify system problems rather than unpacking boxes.  There will still be alot of the move team on the floor finishing installations etc.  

Please provide the list by end of business today (thursday).

I agree.  The traders need access only to the physcal trading systems.  They are only trading next day physical gas for the remainder of May, so they do not need access to any other systems.

Attached is a file that list the employees going over to AEP and what data access they currently have within our systems.  At close all of these individuals will be cut back to having only access to AEP/HPL.  Currently some of these individuals have access to more than just HPL or Texas.  I'd like to cut them back to have only access to HPL and Texas ASAP.  Please review and let me know if you'd like to make any exceptions.  The spreadsheet has tabs for Sitara, Unify and Global.

"Re: New Car - FYI","Thanks for the info.  I wanted to pick your brain about cars for Mom and Dad.  My initial research of Large Cars and Luxury Cars in Consumer Report did not yield a lot of obvious choices to me.

  I only considered CR ""Recomended "" cars.  There are a few options in the $20,000 to $25,000 range for example the Ford Crown Victoria/Mecury Grand Marquis; but I do not believe the cars in this price range will give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to.  The only car in the $30,000 to $35,000 range is the Buick Park Avenue which I think will be a pretty close fit to what they are driving now but I'm not sure they want to spend this kind of money.  Of course the really nice luxury cars that will sure to satisfy them for example, the Lincoln Town Car and Cadillac Deville are in the $40,000 to $45,000 range.

Dad said he spent $23,000 for his Olds 98 in 1991 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks.  My plan at this time is to focus on the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis and the Park Avenue first and see if they come close to meeting Mom and Dad's needs.

Any Thoughts?

Love,

Tom

Tom,

Got your voicemail and e-mail.  Below is the explanation I received from Corp Benefits on the price for your recent activity through Hewitt.  Will get back with you on final resolution to this problem before the end of the week. Hopefully will have an answer for you by  Thursday, no later than Friday. 

Thanks again for your patience.

Response:
Irma,

I've just verified the following information from Hewitt:

On Tuesday, 11/20/01, Mr. Martin spoke with a rep at Hewitt to roll over his ESOP balance into the Savings Plan.  He made this request at 4:28 p.m.  Since this was after the market close (which was 3:00 p.m.), his transaction did not occur until the 11/21/01 update.  He rolled 1,522.00 shares over to the Savings Plan, at a total value of $7,625.22, which is $5.01 per share.  That value was posted to the Enron Corp. stock fund in the Savings Plan the evening of 11/21/01.  They were in his Savings Plan account as of the morning of 11/22/01 (which was Thanksgiving Day).  
On 11/23/01, Mr. Martin transferred his holdings in the Enron Corp. Stock Fund to the Stable Asset fund.  He did this transfer at 2:22 p.m., via the web site.  However, on 11/23/01, the stock exchange closed at 1:00 p.m., instead of the usual 3:00 p.m.  Consequently, the transfer was not effective on Friday, 11/23/01, but occurred on the next business day, which was 11/26/01.  At the time of the transfer, the value in the Stock Fund was $6,113.26, which was equal to $4.01 per share.

Thanks again for your patience and cooperation.

Subject:	ESOP rollover into Savings Plan

I left you a voicemail as well.  I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it appears the ESOP rollover into Savings Plan ocurred as we discussed last week.  I got into the Savings Plan on Friday 11/23 and moved the Enron shares to Stable Assets also as we discussed.  It appears that the price used was Monday's close of $4.01 instead of Friday's close of $4.71.

So where do we go from here?  I am assuming per our previous meeting that whether $4.01 or $4.71 is used; that one of these prices will be used to keep me whole versus a price sometime in September (probably September 30th) when the ESOP shares should have been put into the Savings Plan.

Please call me at you earliest convenience to resolve this.

Thanks,

Tom

Since the bidweek procedures we are proposing include AEP directing HPL activities for June during bidweek if we determine that close will occur June 1st, then it seems only logical that we should start operating as ENA at the same time.

Barbara Gray has informed me that you have been inquiring about modifying the Texas EOL physical products to ENA as the counterparty for June.  The products you have to be concerned about are Waha and Exxon Katy Tailgate.  The other physical products are HPL related and will no longer be used.  There is a slight possibility that the Agua Dulce product may continue but I will contact you if it needs to be changed to ENA.  Our need for these ENA products will be approximately May 16th, when we want to roll out our June products.

Hello from Inside FERC,

Tomorrow (Wednesday) is the last business day of October, and it's the final
deadline for Inside FERC's Gas Market Report's November 2001 bidweek
spot-price survey.

Attached is an Excel workbook (IFMONTH2.XLS) to report your price data in.

Please take a moment to review the instructions at the top of the file. They
specify what kinds of deals to report and -- more importantly -- what deals
NOT to report.

Please note that a significant portion of our survey respondents are
reporting counterparties with their deals.  We want you to too. Please list
counterparties in the ""comments"" column. Counterparty information is held in
confidence and not shared with third parties.

Reported deals with counterparty information are treated as more reliable
than trades without.

Please make sure to add the name of a contact person for your company and a
telephone number to reach them with at the top of your price file.

When you are done, e-mail the price workbooks back to both
kelley_doolan@platts.com and MHENERGY@YAHOO.COM by 1:00 PM (Central), on
Wednesday, Oct. 31.

November monthly prices will be published on Thursday, Nov. 1.

As always, thanks for your help, and if you have any questions, please feel
free to call or e-mail me at the telephone number or address below.


Best regards, and I hope you and yours have a safe and happy Halloween,.

Subject:	FW: Tom Martin's ESOP 

Mr. Martin,

I wanted to take a moment this morning to provide you an update on your recent ESOP change request.  I have received confirmation from Corporate Benefits that your form has been received.  Unfortunately due to current switch over of our Savings vendor, which was also the vendor for our ESOP program, we are still experimenting the blackout period on any savings plan activity through November 20th.  

Also, I wanted to point out my error with the processing of your form.  Since this was a very old stock program form, I accidentally confused it for an enrollment form to our direct service program, which is the program that allows employees to purchase stock through payroll deduction twice a month.  In a nutshell, I accidentally forwarded your form to the incorrect resource and then had to re-route it to the correct group which is our corporate contact for the 401(K) savings plan.  

I apologize for the delay in providing you with this update and am extremely sorry for my mistake.   Please let me know if there is anything that I can do asides from following up with Corporate benefits after the blackout period to check on the status of your request and then I will provide your asst, Laura with an update. 

Thanks.

Subject:	Gas Contract

Gentlemen,

Please nominate 65,000 MMbtu of gas into the TXU Lone Star Gas pipeline for
the account of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics in Fort Worth for the month of
January, 2002.

Enron has a master agreement with Lockheed Martin (Agreement CA 1135).  On
November 8, 2001, Enron executed a 12-month confirmation to deliver gas to
the Lone Star Pipeline for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics in Fort Worth.

The agreed upon date for the January 2002 nomination was five days prior to
the beginning of the month.  That date has passed, but Lone Star has
indicated that it will accept a nomination if received by Friday, January 4,
2002.

Please make the nomination.

Also, if you will, please call to let me know that it was made.

I appreciate your help in what must be a most frustrating time for you.

Thanks,

Ed Fore
Facilities Engineer
Lockheed Martin Aero - Fort Worth

I don't believe I have any issues with financial terms that you said (again I want to see what it looks in writing).  I still don't fully understand your reasons for handling this the way that you are but at the end of the day you are correct when you say that even if 50% of the commercial people is all that we end up, this shop will still be better than any other on the street.  I guess get me this document to look at when ever you can.

Bob,

I talked to Chris about the change of plans.  I am sorry that it did not work out but Dave has more knowledge of the Texas grid and he runs our Waha physical trading activities.  He works well with Mike and he is willing to do whatever we need him to do.  He is spending the rest of the week to suck as much out of Daren as he can.  If there is any training for the logistics systems that he can go to, he should do that as well.  If you have any other recomendations to get him up to speed on the Logistics side I sure would appreciate it.

Barbara Gray has informed me that you have been inquiring about modifying the Texas EOL physical products to ENA as the counterparty for June.  The products you have to be concerned about are Waha and Exxon Katy Tailgate.  The other physical products are HPL related and will no longer be used.  There is a slight possibility that the Agua Dulce product may continue but I will contact you if it needs to be changed to ENA.  Our need for these ENA products will be approximately May 16th, when we want to roll out our June products.

Please call me if you have any questions.

I talked to Brian and he and I agreed to the concept but we want it to more simple (ie. less expensive).  We are thinking about just getting together and have some beers at Cabo's while signing Christmas cards.  No catering, just a few drinks and maybe some appetizers off the menu.  The traders probably don't have many if any customers that are not already covered by Brian's group but check with Eric, Joe, Charlie, Daren and Dave.

Tom,

Michael Salinas is planning the Christmas Card Signing Party.  It looks like it's going to be at Cabo's THIS MONDAY, December 3rd at 5:00.  

I assume that we will be splitting the cost, but I guess I really shouldn't assume because of everything the company is going through right now.  Michael estimates the total cost to be $1000, making your half $500.  Let me know what you think.

Also, are there any customers (for the trading side) that we need to be sure are included to receive Christmas cards?  

Thanks,
Laura

Tom, here's a short version of the vacation hours that everyone has REMAINING.  Just FYI, I went ahead and included everyone on the desk.  I've also included a spreadsheet that I downloaded from SAP, which shows more detail.  It is shown in hours, as well.  Let me know if you need anything else!  

Laura

Eric Bass  -  88 hrs vacation remaining
Dave Baumbach  -  80 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
Gary Bryan  -  160 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
JD Buss  -  120 hrs vac remaining
Daren Farmer  -  68 hrs vac remaining
Bryan Hull  -  128 hrs vac remaining
Mark Knippa  -  152 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
Tom Martin  -  104 hrs vac remaining
Mike Olsen  -  96 hrs vac remaining
Joe Parks  -  96 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
Jim Schwieger  -  0 hrs vac remaining
Jay Smith  -  30 hrs vac remaining
Laura Vuittonet  -  71 hrs vac remaining
Charlie Weldon  -  60 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet

One more thing ... the report does not include vacation taken between the dates of November 1st thru November 15th.  The November 15th pay period is when I enter that information, so SAP does not have it yet.  I corrected the email for those who have taken vacation during this pay period (so far), which were Charlie, Joe, Eric, Mark, and you.  

Also, Dave's vacation is not appearing in SAP, so the report shows NONE of his vacation time.  He and I talked about this, and he has 8 days remaining.  I am going to correct his vacation time in SAP.

I talked to Chris about the Texas opportunity and he seemed interested.  He still wanted to talk to Scott Neal about a potential cash trading role on the East desk.  In the same breath he said that he welcomed an opportunity that had some commercial aspects but did not require running a book (which the East desk job would probably require).  I believe he is hesitant to leave the East environment because he is so familiar with it.  He said he will let me know on Monday morning.

- We will carry data to support the same gas and power products as were on EnronOnline. Please contact us if you will need different products from what was on EnronOnline.

- We have prepared a list of top customers in CDN and US Gas and Power (copy attached), which we will be using as a guide in chasing signed Password Applications.

- To speed the registration process, top customers will be preloaded into the system for activation as soon as we receive their Password Application. 

- We are intending to use a simple, online GTC, which can be superceded by a negotiated Master Agreement, as with EnronOnline.

- Internal trader names have been circulated to each desk head for approval.

John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.

"RE: Nov 2001 Price Discrepancy - TBG Cogen","I haven't worked on TBG in four years, so I am probably not who you want on this matter.  I would suggest starting with Frank Vickers or Scott Neal.

Thomas,

TBG Cogen Partners is disputing the rate invoiced by ENA for November 2001 gas. ENA invoiced a rate of $3.4367 for deal # 22957. The customer claims the rate should be as follows: first 4,000/d @ $2.25, remainder over 4,000 @ monthly index of delivery location + $.025. Please review and advise.

Thanks,
Genaro
