  John, I have prepared a more formal position regarding the exemption of ""Compressor Fuel"" consumed in a ""continuing business activity"" (Gas services).  Before I submit this position to you, I will circulate my position letter within the company and validate the facts.  
I will be relying primarily on Colorado Regulations 26-102.21 or 39-26-104.1(d.1).  Have these regulations changed recently?  My service may be out of date.
Attached below are schedules for Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption for the audit period.

Dan,

Here is my initial response.  I haven't had time to do too much research on
this, but this preliminarily the Department's position.  Sorry this took so
long  but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority.  jp

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing
accompanying the transfer of cash from Enron to Northwest Pipeline Corp., I
might agree.  But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.

I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.
Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service
to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need
more research on this.

The disposition of penalty and interest will be resolved at a level above the auditor level.

"Legal Essentials for Managers Training","	As you may be aware, I am conducting an in-house seminar on compliance with labor and employment laws and the practice of good employee relations.  This 4 hour, interactive program is tailored to Enron's culture and ETS-specific issues.  Stan Horton and the ETS Division Heads have mandated attendance for all Managers and above, and for those persons who have supervisory responsibility.

	The main goals of this session are to help management avoid employment-related litigation, maintain a trouble-free workplace, and maximize employee productivity.  In order to accomplish these goals, it is imperative to understand the intricate connection between sound management practices and legal requirements.

	Some of the topics covered are: maintaining a discrimination and harassment free workplace; the hiring process; compensation issues; performance management; lawful terminations; and all related topics that are necessary to effectively control the risks associated with managing a workforce.

	There are three sessions open in October -- the 3rd, 17th, and 31st.  They run from 8:00 to Noon.  Please 
contact my assistant, Miranda Southard, by e-mail to enroll in one of these sessions.  She will then provide you the exact location and other particulars.

	Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

Brian

"RE: Gray County Interconnect","We will defer to Rates & Certificates on this one.    We need to be thinking about what each entity is getting for it's investment in the project. 

And there should be no tax grossup since the taxable entity will not be paying tax on the transaction.     And I think the tariff reads that it can only be charged if in fact it will be paid.

Steve Harris has asked for a CIAC for 50% of TW's construction costs on the Gray County interconnect.  I assume that this must be posted on the bulletin board the same as any other CIAC.  Is this correct?  

Also, the economics are based on NNG revenues covering both TW's and NNG's capital expenditure.  For recovery purposes wouldn't it be better for NNG to reimburse TW 100% of its costs?  Other wise isn't there a miss-match in that the volumes will be reflected in NNG's rate design with 50% of the cost of service residing on TW's books?

I had a meeting with Steve Harris this afternoon.  We would like to receive reimbursement of half of the capital expenditures for the Gray County Interconnect in 2001.  This will be done as a CIAC.  Any tax gross up will wash at an ETS level.  Please let me know when we can expect payment.

MESSAGE FROM GREG PORTER

________________________________________________
As you know, Transwestern filed a complaint against Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on September 28, 2001.  The complaint asked FERC to find SoCalGas' refusal to pay the tariff commodity rate constitutes a violation of Transwestern's tariff and the 1995 Global Settlement.  SoCalGas filed an Answer on October 18, 2001.  In summary, SoCalGas' Answer stated:

1.	SoCalGas did not affirmatively agree to pay the stated tariff rate during the Global Settlement.  

2.	The commodity charge SoCal has been paying is consistent with the course of performance/conduct prior to, and after, the Global Settlement.  

3.	Since the Global Settlement has been in effect, SoCalGas has relied on the commodity/usage charges that Transwestern has billed.    

4.	SoCalGas claims they had been paying the appropriate rate and that Transwestern failed to include the correct rate in its tariff; such omission has created ambiguity and any ambiguity should be construed against the drafter of the tariff, Transwestern.

5.	If the Commission disagrees with SoCalGas and declines to reject the complaint outright, any retroactive billing adjustment should be limited to a six-month period.

6.	SoCalGas admits that a retroactive billing adjustment for the escalation factor for six months is reasonable and an escalation factor going forward for the remaining term of its Contract No. 8255 is appropriate.

In addition to the foregoing statements, SoCalGas provided that it, like Transwestern, was interested in resolving this matter through ADR.  Accordingly, we will be coordinating with SoCalGas and FERC's ADR group to explore possible ADR procedures.

We will advise as new developments warrant.  In the meantime, should you have any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me at (402) 398-7406 or Maria Pavlou at (402) 398-7097.

"ETS Operations companies (1202, 42P, and 184)","Tracy and James,

Elaine and Phil thought it would be nice to include this summary page in the plan review package for Stan's review next week.

 
I think Rod mentioned that Stan has set a target for Phil of 5.0MM for 2002.  Please advise if this is still valid because Phil personally has not heard that from Stan.  The numbers that we have in Adaytum match the $4.4 MM net contribution.  The remaining $0.6MM are salary offsets on NNG.  42P does not have employees and they use NNG employees.  When they do that, NNg charges the salaries of the employees for the applicable # of hours to 42P.  Therefore,  42P covers expenses that NNG would have to bear otherwise.  Phil feels that the $0.6MM of salaries offsets should be counted toward the 5.0 target since it's a benefit that 42P brings to NNG.  James and I talked about this on the phone.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks!

Elaine,
This is the response we received from Corp. on allocations to 1202 and 1195.


Mary, 

Other than possibly benefit items, we won't allocate to those companies individually.  I am getting a copy of the Restricted stock allocations and they may have some charges to these companies.  I suspect that any charges to these two are in the ETS-HQ line but will work with Sharon Aulds to confirm.

"Outstanding Invoices","Enron Transportation Services has 2115 outstanding invoices totaling nearly $8.5 million, which need coding and/or approval in the iPayit system.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, ETS employees need to do their part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors.  
 
If you purchase items that generate an invoice (including cell phones, pagers, etc.) or if you are responsible for coding and/or approving invoices, after you receive your e-mail notification, please log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action to process the invoice (s) .  
 
Because the invoice (s)  cannot be processed for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox, it's important to code/approve invoices within five (5) days of e-mail notification.  
 
I expect ETS to stay current on payment of ALL vendor invoices.  
 
I have approved invoices in the system and it's very to use.  We will continue to monitor the status of our accounts payable, and we expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.
 
If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Carolyn Centilli at 713-345-8496.   Password questions should be directed to the ISC help desk, 713-345-4727.

Hello everyone.  Management has begun to look toward the 4th quarter and is requesting certain information from each business unit.  

I need to know, by 10:30am Wednesday:

	a. Total bonus accrual for 2001
	b. Amount of bonus accrual that is (or will be) accrued YTD through September 2001
	c. Amount remaining to be accrued in 4th Qtr 2001

Additionally, each CAO* has been asked to compile a list of potential hurdles/challenges/clean-up items for the 4th Qtr. that will be discussed at an offsite this week.  You may want to touch base with them and make sure they are aware of this and come prepared.  I have sent a reminder message to them today also.

Thanks,
Steve


*with the exception of EGEP  (Jim call me if you want to discuss)


PS - Faith and Tracy - I'm assuming you guys will coordinate for wholesale and stan's world respectively.  If you'd like me to contact any group directly, let me know.

Only the Ad Val and Tax Compliance groups intend to charge clean fuels.  If Methanol is the only thing left and it is Corporate, then the charges would stay on the Corp. tax cost centers instead of being charged to ETS.  Thanks for your information.  This will not change your 2002 allocations since I had not included the Clean Fuels charges.

Clean Fuels was comprised of three companies.  The MTBE plant and the Mt Belvieu storage and grid were sold to EOTT this year.  Enron kept the Methanol and has shut it down.  I guess I need to understand exactly what they are doing for which company.  The Methanol plant actually rolls up to Corp and other, so allocating costs to them will be a hit to Corp.

Hello everyone. Management has begun to look toward the 4th quarter and is
requesting certain information from each business unit. 

I need to know, by 10:30am Wednesday: 

a. Total bonus accrual for 2001 
b. Amount of bonus accrual that is (or will be) accrued YTD through September
2001 
c. Amount remaining to be accrued in 4th Qtr 2001 

Additionally, each CAO* has been asked to compile a list of potential
hurdles/challenges/clean-up items for the 4th Qtr. that will be discussed at
an offsite this week. You may want to touch base with them and make sure they
are aware of this and come prepared. I have sent a reminder message to them
today also. 

Thanks, 
Steve 


*with the exception of EGEP (Jim call me if you want to discuss) 


PS - Faith and Tracy - I'm assuming you guys will coordinate for wholesale and

As we collaboratively worked with the ENW team to put Pipeline Capacity on EnronOnline we worked through annual maintenance costs for each of the ETS pipes to participate in the offering.  You and Philippe then had further discussions refining that figure.  As we work on budgets do you mind refreshing me with the annual EnonOnline maintenance cost per pipe that you and Philippe had agreed to.

"FW: PGG Q3 Forecast - Confidential","FYI

-----Original Message-----
From: Stevens, Kirk 
Sent: Monday, October 01, 2001 2:45 PM
To: Butts, Bob; Hayslett, Rod
Cc: Piro, Jim
Subject: PGG Q3 Forecast - Confidential 


Quick update on our Q3 earnings (still very prelim).

3rd Current Estimate:
       IBIT = (2.7)
       NI    = (1.3)

Latest Forecast:
       IBIT = (9.1)
       NI   = 1.7

Major variance - TOLI loss for the month is expected to be $9.5m, or $6.5m
worse than our 3rd Current Estimate.  The recent sharp decline in the stock
market is the driver (post Sept 11 market impact).
Without the additional TOLI loss, we'd be right on our 3rd Current Estimate.

Major Risks - AA&Co. Issues
The following issues are currently being reviewed and challenged (to different
degrees) by AA&Co Portland (note- Houston AA&Co - Duncan -has been updated on
these items by Tim McCann - AA&Co Portland).  Our forecast numbers above
assume positive outcome on all these issues.  We will continue to hold our
ground, feeling our positions are appropriate.  But since several of these
have no direct impact on PGE stand-alone reporting, Houston (you) have better
leverage getting these through the AA&Co staff in Houston that may question
our treatment.

TOLI Deferred Tax Reserve - $9m
PGE proposes to reverse this reserve established Q4 1999 (at the date of the
Sierra Sale announcement) since the deal with Sierra was terminated, and since
we now feel recording this type of reserve is more appropriate at the time of
an actual transfer of the TOLI assets to Enron under any future sale of PGE. 
AA&Co is fighting this one hard, Greek Rice has been made aware of this.

Pension Credit Capitalization - $5m (YTD 9/30 true-up)
PGE proposes that we no longer capitalize our FAS 87 pension credit since our
rates assume zero pension costs for ratemaking purposes.  AA&Co. is using a
FAS 87 implementation issue to say we still need to capitalize the credit, and
possibly set up a FAS 71 reg asset (although they're still somewhat pushing no
change to our current accounting, ie just keep capitalizing the pension
credit).

Merger MOU Obligation - PVC - $5.7m
Since our new ratecase allows recovery of the remaining costs for this
committment made as part of the Enron purchase of PGE, we believe the
remaining liability set up in purchase accounting on PVC's books can be
reversed.  AA&Co. feels we still have an obligation to perform the MOU
committments (which we do), but we feel that our original estimate of this
cost at the time of the PGE/Enron merger has now been reduced as a result of
the ratemaking treatment, so it should be reduced to zero.  AA&Co. prefers
that we bring the liability down over time as we fullfill the committment,
letting earnings effect come in over time.

Severance Reserves - PGH1 ($2.7m) and PVC ($3.5m)
At the time of the Enron purchase of PGE, severance reserves were set up for
an anticipate number of involuntary terminations expected to occur within the
first few years of the merger.  Over time, actual severance payments made to
PGH or PGE employees have been reversed out of these reserves.  At this point,
no future terminations are contemplated which relate to the initial merger
conditions/environment.  Accordingly we plan to reverse these balances to
income Q3.  

At this point, AA&Co. thinks we should consider taking these back against
goodwill (which we feel goes against Purchase Accounting guidance).  

Litigation Reserve - PGH1 ($2.1m)
PGC and it's subsidiaries had numerous legal issues outstanding at the merger
date (eg. Columbia Steel, Trojan Recovery, City of Burbank Contract,
Bonneville Pacific).   A reserve of $5 million was established in purchase
accounting for any legal/litigation and settlement costs incurred by PGC and
subsidiaries to defend itself in these types of claims/proceedings.  The
reserve also was to cover any litigation filed post merger directly related to
the merger.

Since the merger date, we have reversed actual costs incurred for these types
of activities in the amount of $2.9 million, leaving a remaining reserve
balance at 9/30/01 of $2.1 million.

At this time, all legal claims outstanding at the merger date have been
settled satisfactorily where no material contingency exists.    Accordingly,
we will reverse the remaining balance in Q3 2001.

Again, AA&Co has indicated that we had over estimated the original cost of
these activities in purchase accounting, and that we should now reverse the
difference back through goodwill (again, we think this is a misapplication of
purchase accounting since we are well outside the orginal 1-2 year window for
adjusting goodwill).


There are a few other items we're debating with AA&Co (in the range of $4m to
6m), and I'll let you know if any of these start to look at risk.   
Let me know if you have any questions on these items (503) 464-7121.

I will follow up on this with the ISC....that is, having the costs billed direct to the pipleline companies within ETS as opposed to billing to a single ETS company and then having to turn around and redistribute.

There is an agreed percent in practice for 2001.  For 2002 do we need to stay with that approach?  If the ISC can provide us with the details of usage percentages then this approach may be more supportable.  

Chris....can the ISC give us the detailed usage statistics to support the allocation?  Also, is there a time before 9/14 that you can start giving us a sense of what our ""number"" and percent share of the cost would be under this methodology?  Thanks....

Jim....concerning company 536....if we bill the individual companies for their usage, which company would bear the cost of the company 536 use?

This week Mike and I met with the ISC to review the methodology they intend to use for allocating 2002 SAP support costs.  ETS' allocation will be based on our usage of their resources as measured by a weighted average of 3 factors:

Number of users - 28% weight
Number of documents we have on the system (a measure of the number of transactions we process) - 54% weight
Amount of master data we have on the system (as determined by counts of objects such as cost centers, projects, orders, etc.) - 18% weight

Details on the amount we will be asked to plan for (and allocated to in 2002) will be available by 9/14.  If you have any questions or concerns about this approach please call me.

The file we received from Corporate listed an estimated 461 domestic employees and 526 international (987 total) for the 2002 plan.  This information came from the Corporate headcount request to the BU's that was due on 6/22.  Currently there's a group of 937 (451 domestic, 486 international) that is being supported.  I'll call you tomorrow to see why there's such a large discrepancy between this headcount and the 6 you're projecting.

Subject:	RE: Functional Reclass

If we are going to be required to reclass Plan, 1CE, and 2CE for this, I need the company number and cost center where the Operations costs are coming from and I need the reductions by month.  Will this affect the Accounting Hierarchy tie-out (if an entire cost center moves) or is it just dollars?

Thanks,  Elaine

Subject:	RE: Functional Reclass

WE are worried about the numbers we show Stan for the 2002 budget.  We don't want to show Shelley with a variance due to movement from these groups.  Rod agreed to do this for Shelley.  I think we will have to roll through restatement.  I don't want to show Stan something different for 2002 budget comparisons than what we are showing him now monthly.  I realize that these amounts are small to each group listed, but when added together they are material to Shelley.

Importance:	High

Can we just move the dollars in the 3rd CE and show the offsetting variances.  They will wash out in the total entity amounts, and they are small dollars.  By restating earlier estimates (i.e. Plan, 1CE, 2CE), we create confusion because we have already published these previous estimates.

I would prefer NOT to restate anything we have already finalized.

Please let me know if you have an issue with my recommendation.

Thanks,  Elaine

Tracy Geaccone requested that we restate the 2001 Plan (and therefore the !st & 2nd Current Estimates) to reflect the reclassification of the positions listed below.  In the 3rd quarter forecast I will be showing the following additions to Gas Logistics previously reflected in other functional areas:
							From		To
	GISB Manager			$84,685		Executive	Gas Logistics (Market Services)
	NNG Measurement Desk	$57,915		FA&A		Gas Logistics

"RE: Utilicorp $1.2 million","My concern is that what we are discussing would require the expenditure of funds of an extra $500K this year in order to move about $700 K of income to next year.    I would like to know what event in 2002 will allow us to create the income.   I believe based upon the contract, that the event has already taken place.    If someone can explain to me how this makes sense, I would like to hear it.

Subject:	Utilicorp $1.2 million



I just wanted to close the loop on the question of deferring the $.7million UCU credit to 2002.  The last we talked, it was decided that we could not defer the credit because of cash target concerns.  If this is still the directive, we will see a positive variance to Third Current Estimate in October of $1.2 million.  

Would you confirm that this is still our decision?  If so, we will include the earnings upside  in our Quarter Forecast next week.

Thanks

"Re: 4 Quarter Update","Tracy-

I will see if we have any updates, although I doubt we would change the number from last we met.  I believe the presentation of the numbers has caused some confusion.  We are forecasting a (5.2) recurring loss, plus a (13.8) loss on Marlin, totaling (19.0) loss.  I think you added the 19 and the 5.2 to get to the 24.2 you have listed below.  The correct total is (19.0).

Subject: RE: EGAS 4th Qtr


I think you may be reading more into this than was meant by the memo.  There are alot of business entities that roll-up into EGS.  There usually is some flexibility in each business unit regarding their quarterly numbers.  By having all the facts we as a team can present them to Causey.  We may very well be able to accelerate earnings in one group for a quarter to make up deficiencies in another group.  It would be nice to be able to discuss these options as a unit before reporting them to corporate.  No one is trying to manage anything other than to give Rick a complete assessment as to what EGS results look like and the fexibility we have as a unit.  This is all Tracy was trying to convey.  No one has asked that you not respond to corporate only that we have a chance to see what our numbers look like as an entity before releasing to corporate.  I don't think Rick has any problem with this but I will ask Rod by this memo to check with Rick to see if he does.
 
I think this is pretty consistent with the way wholesale and retail report to corporate.
 
Thanks.

I would like to discuss the below message when you have a chance.  There has been a lot of distrust and concern over ""managed information"" with respect to the international assets.  My team has overcome this by going out of our way to cooperate and be transparent with corp the last year and a half.  I am uncomfortable asking my people not to respond to corp requests for information.  I also think the tone of the message is demeaning and could have a morale impact on my folks.

Mark, 

In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2nd CE.  It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferred out of EGAS since the 2nd CE  ( Azurix International and South America Merchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East.   This does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe to EGAS in the 4th Qtr.   We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will send you those numbers when we are done.

Sent:	Tuesday, October 02, 2001 9:51 AM

Subject:	REQUEST - 2001 Operating Expenses - High Priority

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve

I would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully able to explain the trends on these sheets.   I would also like to begin to add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.   Accounting quite possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again.   This is not a project that will be complete by friday, but it does need to get complete this year.

"EOTT Issue","
On tuesday of this week after EOTT's staff meeting, I was made aware of a potential environmental estimate problem (too big).    I am looking at ways of potentially dealing with the problem so that Lawrence will feel comfortable not booking a reserve in the 3rd qtr, which may have consequences on the plans we have underway to recapitalize the entity.   This means coming up with an answer very quickly.   There are a number of potential alternatives and I am sure there are more than I will attempt to lay out here.

1) We could simply make a contribution to EOTT for the sole purpose of environmental cleanup, and if unused will be returned.   Seems like an expense item, but doable.

2) We could provide an insurance policy to EOTT to provide for environmental expenses in excess of the existing policy, for a fee.    Better expense treatment (we get to manage the reserve) and appears to cover the EOTT issue.   Because this is an affiliated deal, I guess it would have to go through the audit committee.   Potentially the captive could be used.

3) Provide an accounting answer that might give EOTT a one-time gain to offset the one time reserve set-up.   i.e., there is a least an argument that the recapitalization proposed will result in the extinguishment of a portion of the debt on the books represented by the API's.     Since we are getting a conversion of less than a dollar for dollar deal, this should be doable.

For Lawrence:  Jim Bouillion has indicated that the insurance proposal may have merit, and so I will need some input from you regarding the coverage that exists now and what we would want going forward.    If you want us to talk directly with Susan, we will.   I am thinking that you are getting a quote for increasing the cap on the existing policy and that we could give you the same deal, or maybe even slightly better, to satisfy the audit committee.  

I am obviously looking for any help that I can get here, so if there any more ideas I would like to hear them.    If you have questions, feel free to ask.    Stan is aware of what we are discussing.   1) and 3) were his requests to review.

"RE: EPPI GPM Oneok agreement","Rita and All:

All:
The contract maximum of 4.45% (not 4.5%) is based on both Field and Mainline fuel for the particular MID (10, 11, 12 and/or 13) in which the gas is received.  The attached spreadsheet is a history of the relevant MID fuels.  When the contract originated in December 1995 the MID average was below 4% and the contract generated modest revenue for NNG.

The 6/1/97 tariff revision greatly increased mainline fuels, especially in MID 11 where the majority of the contract volume is received, where the fuel jumped from 1.48% to 2.90%.  The 6/1/97 revision increased the volume weighted average fuel (a measure valid for comparison purposes only) from 3.81% to 4.65%, which until the 8/1/01 revision to 4.71% was the zenith.

Mainline fuel appears to be the problem: it has increased from 1.84% effective 6/1/99 to 2.25% effective 6/1/00 to 2.66% effective 8/1/01.  This .82% increment makes the difference between profit and our current situation.

Rita:
Can you tell us how we got here and what areas we could focus our attention on to potentially remedy the problem?  Which station have increased fuel consumption over the years?  And how are prior period adjustments made?  Can you send me the calculation spreadsheets for the relevant tariff revision periods?

NNG is billing fuel retention on out-of-balance deliveries.

We only collect the 4.5% on the receipt volumes, however NNG is charging fuel based on the receipt plus the out-of-balance delivery.
This out of balance collection goes to trackers.  We could lower the amounts over the 4.5% if NNG stops charging out-of-balance retention when this contract goes short.  (stop charging out-of-balance retention has other problems assocated with it). This contract was consistently short in 2001.  This is not all of the problem but it is the controllable part.  That is, we need to make these two contracts long to the system each month.  Or, put an OBA at Bushton's inlet (The OBA at Bushton's inlet also has other problems assocated with it).

Mike and Steve please confirm my calculations to the contract terms to see if I am correct, also can you set a meeting with Logistics, Regulatory and Tracy Geaccone to discuss. 

The non-controllable factors are NNG's Field fuel rate keeps increasing making it consistently over the 4.5%, and lower gas prices increase the exposure to EPPI.

Subject:	Sunrise update; Steering Committee meeting postponed

Due to Rick's leadership offsite, the Sunrise Steering Committee meeting this Wednesday morning has been rescheduled for October 2, 10am.  Because of that postponement, the October 17 meeting will be cancelled.  

You may have heard that Mark Frank has moved to EES, where he will Controller for EnronDirect.  We will miss his day to day involvement, but he has expressed an interest in staying involved as a commercial user of the Sunrise data warehouse.  

Here's where we are on the project.  

We are on track for our September 30 data warehouse rollouts of earnings, AP and AR.  Testing is going well, and we appreciate each BU sending users to work with us to test the functionality.  There will be standard reports for each of those new content areas.  Be sure your BU is well represented in the training scheduled for the last 2 weeks of October!

Following the September 30 rollouts, we will have all of our originally planned content in the data warehouse, so we will be concentrating on increasing usage.  We have been presenting roadshows (demos that come to you), which we plan to expand.  In addition, we will be identifying power users in your group who will be experts at both SAP reporting and Business Objects reporting from the data warehouse, so they can advise others as to the best option for a specific reporting need.  Let me know who you'd like us to work with in your group.

The Adaytum planning model is nearly completed.  We are working with Steve Schwarzbach and Greg Adams to ensure that any changes to their excel templates will be incorporated into the model.  We will be running parallel for the 2002 Plan process that is due October 4 - excel templates will be turned in at that time, and the Adaytum model will be completed and reconciled back to the excel results shortly after that.  If your group would prefer to start with Adaytum, we have prepared excel output files and we will come and work with your planners at their desk to get them up and running.  Let us know when you want us to work with you.

I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Sorry to bother you with this one again -

in 1999 and 2000, what were the revenues and costs associated with the base gas sales - the footnote disclosure indicates $53 million and $34 million in sales but not the cost.  In addition, going forward, how much of the 2001 and 2002 TG&S expense is solely related to this transaction (i.e. expenses that would not be incurred but for this transaction)? My question may be a bit confusing - call me if I am totally off base!

Talked with Kim Watson.  This is how she suggested we answer Investor Question 3:

	       West Market - 95% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD
	       East Market -  67% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD

The West and East are two separate markets for TW.  The majority of TW's business is the West market.  
The East market offers our shippers more flexibility.  The two percentages should stand alone and not be 
combined.

Kim felt like these needted to be separate as they are two distinct markets

Thanks!  Hope you have a good weekend and don't get any calls from the office.

"Capacity Subscription Strategy","How does this look?

 

Also, I did change some numbers in the excel spreadsheet:

	The Ignacio to Blanco subscription levels were pulling from the row excluding ROFR capacity in the supporting sheet.  I changed it to be consistent with the other 	capacities (which include ROFR capacity).

	Shelley had made some assumptions about East of Thoreau capacity subscription, such as, the USGT 400,000/d contract would remain subscribed (it doesn't 	have ROFR) and she had included the extension of 2-3 other contracts that don't have ROFR.  These contracts were then dropped after 2005.  I continued the 	extensions through 2006.

	I changed the East of Thoreau capacity to 750,000/d from 850,000/d.

Fair Value is applied to plant and is being amortized over a useful life.
TW Fair Value is very similar to Goodwill in that it represents an excess over historical book value, and is not formally being recoverd in rates; BUT at the time of the  acquistion it was treated as a purchase price allocation an applied to plant. Goodwill is meant to be a ""leftover"" after all costs have been allocated.

Subject:	La Plata to Bloomfield Drag Reducing Agent Application Proposal

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Thanks for your help on this.

"2002 Plan Dates & Information","Attached is the revised calendar for the completion of the 2002 Plan.  As you will note, the dates have been moved up approximately 2 weeks in most cases.  This is a result of the recent management changes and executive availability.

A couple of notes on the dates:

-Please note that dates for assessments apply to ALL BUSINESS UNITS who will be senders of costs.
-The October 18th due date for the Presentation Pages: I will provide more information at a later date on this.
-The dates highlighted in yellow are not 2002 Plan related, but merely a reminder of other significant items that will be occurring in this time frame.

Also included in the file FYI is the PROPOSED schedule for the Plan/Executive Business Reviews with the Office of the Chairman.  These are still subject to change.  Rick Causey's office (Sharron Westbrook) is coordinating the schedules of the applicable attendees.  I will let you know when these are final.

Additionally, the Plan will be submitted to Corporate in the traditional format, Excel files.  We will be sending the templates out on (or by) September 20, as reflected in the revised calendar.  However, our strategy is still to enter 2002 with the full plan ( I/S, B/S, Cash Flow) loaded into Adaytum and to utilize Adaytum going forward from that point.  Therefore, we will be enhancing the Excel files to include the level of detail that will be loaded into Adaytum, so there will be additional lines and/or supplemental schedules added to the files.

One more thing - please communicate all of this information to the appropriate individuals in your business unit/group.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,
Steve

Kyle Norosky who works in Enron Corp Business Controls, recently flew to Minneapolis with regard to security issues.  He has told me that his trip is to be charged to ETS/Northern Pipeline cost center or project code.

Please can you let me know what company number and code to charge this to.  The total cost of his trip was $1603.28

Many thanks.

"RE: Updated: Adaytum and Data Warehouse Data Flow (Development of Specs)","This is a preliminary working session  where we (ETS only) will be developing specs that we can provide to Sunrise, communicating our detailed business requirements.  The specs will be given to Sunrise and they will have to let us know if they can do the work and how much it will cost ETS.  Greg Lewis has arranged for a facilitator to help keep us on course during the day.

We have asked you to attend as representative for the Consolidations group.  While we might finish before the end of the day, we believe it is important that most participants reserve the full day in the event we need that much time.  If Tracy or James can attend all or some of the session that would be excellent.

The meeting with Sunrise is scheduled for Friday, November 30, at 11:00 a.m. and Tracy is on the attendee list for that meeting.

If I can answer any more questions, please let me know.

Subject: Project Update


Hello Tracy,

I wanted to share some conversations that I've had with both Demetrics
and
Hoang this week related to the project.

On of the biggest issue seems to be with resources.  I know that you
guys
have been quite busy with your planning process but it has been very
difficult to get the required information or time from the resources
that
are committed to the project.  This is due to the fact that they
currently
have a heavy workload and cannot dedicate the time necessary for the
project.  It is having an impact on the timeline.  The home office model
could be a lot further along if some of the required information was
delivered as requested.  Also, I am also getting a sense that there is a
lack of ownership with regards to the Adaytum application.  It is
important
that the users have a comfort level with the application otherwise it
will
become very difficult to transition it when the project is over.

We need to think about who will administer the system once it is in full
production.  This individual should be identified and running the
administration duties as soon as possible.  My fear is that without
proper
ownership of the application and a dedicated administrator (at least in
the
short run), it will be very difficult to transition the roles.

We've had some technical issues with the production and development
environment.  Although these issues have been resolved, it has had an
impact
on the timeline.

There are times that the definition for the model is not clearly
articulated
and it has resulted in the redesign of the model.  Much time has been
spent
on gathering business process information from various people which has
caused a delay in the model development.

I hope that we can constructively talk through these issues tomorrow and
produce solutions that will rectify the situation, mitigate the risks,
and
result in a successful implementation.


Our call is scheduled for 1:30 tomorrow but I can be available earlier
if
you would like to discuss this.

James,

I believe the Communications for 2002 should be $.2MM in NNG's Gas Logistics...
Anyway...

NNG 2002 increase is due primarily to:
	EPSC			$.3
	Less Capitalized	$.4
	Increase in Benefits	$.15
	Increase in Salaries	$.1
Hope this helps.

Please find attached file. Transportation & Storage Revenue is right off the Earning Model Income Statement. Carlton data can be found in the Commercial Function detail within the ""Database"" worksheet of the Earning Model. The Cash Flow verbiage is very general related to the subject matter, but does provide a business reason on a Direct Cash Flow basis for an item buried within the Indirect Cash Flow format. Call me if you have any further questions.

Can you help explain how the data in the attached file matches the detailed budgets and current estimates you have provided to me?    It may simply, I just haven't had time to look.



Rod,

Thanks for the email.  Can you help me match the information in this email
to your operating plan or cash flow analysis?

"FW: 3CE and Sept Flash","Tracy,
I'm totally confused as to who we're supposed to send numbers to.  I know you got something for 3rd CE from Kenny.  Can you forward that to me so that I can make Mei-Ling happy?  Kenny is out of the office today.

Thanks,

Paula,

I did not send you this before because I was told that Azurix will not be part of EGAS.  I was just told that we need to get Sept flash and 3CE of Azurix from you.  Please input Azurix Sept preliminary flash numbers directly in 3CE file ASAP and let me know when done.  Please call with any question.

Subject:	3rd CE and September Flash

Hi, everyone,

Here we go again.  You all know the drill very well.

The 3rd CE  is due on October 10 and the files are saved in g:\common\jvm\reporting\EGA Regions\2001\Current Estimate\3rd CE folder. 

The requirements include 

   1.   Major Assumptions
   2.   Income Statement in both Corp format and EGAS format( same as ""Hannon format"" - 100% project income, Enron's IBIT and Enron's NI).   A folder named ""EGAS Format"" was created within ""3rd CE"" folder for you to save ""EGAS Format income statement"".
   3.   Indirect Cash Flow
   4.   Variance Explanation for both 3CE vs Plan and 3CE vs 2CE( We only need the explanation of IBIT variance for 3CE vs 2CE)

Please provide the variance explanation for 3CE vs Plan in the ""Variance Explanation"" column (set up to the right of the monthly income statement) for your project.  Please provide the IBIT variance explanation for 3CE vs 2CE in the sheet named ""Var Expl 3CE vs 2CE"" for your project.

Just a few friendly reminders,

1.	Please tie out August actuals to Hyperion by September 26 and drop in September flash in the 3rd CE file. The tentative due date for September flash is Friday, October 5th. Please do not change September final flash numbers while you work on the 3rd CE. 

2.	Please do not change the plan numbers.

3.	These files are linked to the consolidation file.  Please do not insert/delete columns/rows or change the page setup or print range.

4.	Please do not copy value to or put your links into those cells with formula such as ""subtotal"" or ""total"".

We all have very tight deadlines among plan, forecast, earnings release, current estimate and others.  Your cooperation is very imperative to the success of these processes.   Please adhere to the due dates if all possible.  Please feel free to call with any question or suggestion.  Thanks for your effort and assistance.


Mei-Ling

Subject:	November Operational Storage Purchases

Stan,

In October we had a plan to purchase 0.5 Bcf of gas that was projected to bring our operational storage level to 12 Bcf by the end of the month and were concerned about over-filling our storage fields from potential long gas by shippers.  In reality, prices have risen and shippers have shorted the system by 1.7 Bcf month-to-date.  Our original plan, based on a combination of physical requirements and regulatory strategy was as follows:

Ending October Balance		12 Bcf
Ending November Balance		13 Bcf
Ending December Balance		14 Bcf

To acheive this plan we are projecting a purchase in November of at least 2.5 Bcf (depending upon shipper short gas over the remainder of the month).  We also expect to receive 0.3 Bcf of SBA imbalance payback in November that should raise the operational storage levels to approximately 13 Bcf.  We are still at risk for over-filling our storage fields in November and do not wish to buy any volumes that might push us over the 13 Bcf operational storage level.  Therefore, we are targeting the purchase of 2.5 Bcf of gas (which may be adjusted based on the customer's imbalances over the next week) for November.

Kent

Have you had a chance to evaluate your resource needs for the month of

weeks of October.  I am anticipating we will need to focus on the following
items in October:

Upgrade to Contributor V 2.2
Completion of home office model
Completion of administration and consolidation items
Final migration to production
Northern Border
Balance Sheet/Cash Flow


I also wanted to know if you can possibly spare Hoang for two days the week

Subject:	 0701 UAF Gain

In July 2001 TW had a UAF gain of 93,400 dt valued at $258,718.00 which will be recorded in August business.

As expected the UAF gain was reduced after the July 10 repair to the receipt value at the Williams interconnect.  In my opinion a reserve of the $258,718 July gain is not necessary since we currently have $4.3 million already set up and the lack of recourse available to Williams.  Please indicate managements wishes.

Debbie and I have just returned from the NNG/TW UAF meeting.  On TW, a leakey receipt value was repaired on July 10, 2001 at an interconnect with Williams Field Services.  This caused unmetered gas receipts to flow into TW and there does not appear to be any way to estimated Williams losses.  Starting in August we expect the UAF gains to disappear from TW.  If so, we recommend reversal of the UAF reserves at a time management feels appropriate.   

Until then, TW has another $1 million of UAF gains which we wish to reserve.'

The UAF for 0601 has been reconiled and the accounting gain is 316,474 priced at $3.20.  The impact of the gain is $1,012,717.  This amount should be reserved.  

Let me know if you have questions.

In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2nd CE.  It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferred out of EGAS since the 2nd CE  ( Azurix International and South America Merchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East.   This does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe to EGAS in the 4th Qtr.   We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will send you those numbers when we are done.

I would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully able to explain the trends on these sheets.   I would also like to begin to add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.   Accounting quite possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again.   This is not a project that will be complete by friday, but it does need to get complete this year.

Tracy,
There is a lot of confusion as to how 2002 Plan and Actual will be linked and how the related variance reporting will be made available.
I was glad to hear you would be having a separate meeting to discuss this issue.  Would you please make sure that both Cheryl Perchal and Barry Wiederholt are included in this discussion?

Thanks!

"RE: 2 nd version of Plan...","Tracy,
There is no detail of the O&M expense as has been requested.  I read Valerie's note about how they're not geared toward providing that because of their FERC COA vs. SAP.  The allocations page possibly, but they will likely need to provide their best estimate of all of the O&M detail.  However, given that their sale is pending, I don't know what level of scrutiny will be afforded to PGE's costs.  I will check with Lindsey, Butts, et.al. to see.

Also, their file is linked to all of their source files.  This is unacceptable - this exposes our model to linking complications (their file opens up with a manual calculation required to update the numbers) and causes rounding errors.  Please have them enter in their numbers as requested initially: $ in millions, to one decimal point in the cell (for example, a cell may reflect 4.5, but the cell actually contains 4.5211114598793546 because of the links --- we need the cell to reflect and contain just 4.5 .)

Call me and we'll discuss.

Thanks,
Steve

After reviewing the budget yesterday, we noticed that goodwill was still being
amortized in 2002. We need to take that out of your numbers. Jim and Kiri
thought it was approximately $14 million. Thus, PGG should have an IBIT of
$270. Please revise file and send back to me and copy Steve Schwarzbach

Hi Tracy, 

Please see attached for the Plan that Stan Horton will be looking at tomorrow 
morning. This version includes Intercompany interest expense that was not 
previously budgeted. It also has a more detail break-out of capital 
expenditures. 

For the O&M detail pages, we will not be able to give you the same break-out 
for our cost as you have requested. Our GL is build on FERC accounts and is 
not condusive to SAP type sorting. 

Also, note that all O&M are at this point still straight lined for the year. 
The quarterly shaping of earnings will not be available until mid to late 
November. There will be significant swing between quarters from these results 
to the final one. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	ETS resource requirements

Tracy,

I spoke with Fred and we have a resource available to assists with the remaining ETS modeling and development.  Dymetrix can be here this Wednesday and will be dedicated to ETS through the end of the year.  He will be responsible for the completion of the O&M model for home office.  He will also be responsible for the Marketing initiative.  

I spoke to Ben Humann about Omaha's resource needs.  They will require a resource for two weeks starting November 12th to implement the O&M contributor model.  If they should decide to move forward with development of a full financial system, they will require an additional six weeks of time at a minimum.  We will scope their financial system requirements during the initial two weeks to better determine what the actual recourse requirements will be.

As we discussed this morning I will be dedicated to ETS through the end of January.  I will address the remain issues with Operations.  I address data transfer issues between Adaytum and the Data Warehouse.  I will assist with and manage all of the above initiatives.

Please feel free to contact me if you have and questions or concerns.

Thanks
Hoang Vo

"RE:  0701 UAF Gain","Dan, et al
I guess I'm one of those in ""management"" that needs more reasons/clarifications...but...given the reference to ""no recourse against TW"" go ahead and let this specific transaction flow thru income. Case closed.

Separately Dan,
It's been stated below that we expect TW UAF to ""disappear"" starting in August. By magic?
Generally, I'm not comfortable that we have a handle on gains or losses TW <-there seems to be some control issues here->, and as a result I am not comfortable that we have realizable income. Its likely just a matter of educating yours truly, so, separately set up a meeting w me to lead me thru the flow before we start to bring this reserve into income.

Subject:	RE:  0701 UAF Gain

When was it recovered?  In July 2001.

As Cash?	All available gas on the system is sold and converted into cash, UAF gains increase the available gas on the system.  Or it is used for some other system balancing purpose.  (i.e. imbalance, line pack).

What is the period of time imbalances can be disputed?  TWs imbalances are on OBAs which are not governed by the six month GISB standard but the OBA contract terms.  TW is always at risk for measurement adjustments.  TW is also at risk for customers who dispute the valuation of their OBA contracts.  TW and El Paso agreed to a measurement adjustment last year going back 3-5 years which caused a $5 million gain.

Why is this gain deemed real while the others have not?  I have provided two reasons to management not to reserve the July gain.  First, field reports indicate that in the first 10 days of July a receipt value was leaking unmeter gas into TWs system and that leak has no recourse against TW.  Second, TW already has a $4.3 million reserve for undefined measurement adjustments.

The UAF is at a gain so it has already been recovered.  TW was reserving against the possibility of an undefined future measurement adjustment from a shipper which would lower the previously recovered UAF gain.

Subject:	 0701 UAF Gain

In July 2001 TW had a UAF gain of 93,400 dt valued at $258,718.00 which will be recorded in August business.

As expected the UAF gain was reduced after the July 10 repair to the receipt value at the Williams interconnect.  In my opinion a reserve of the $258,718 July gain is not necessary since we currently have $4.3 million already set up and the lack of recourse available to Williams.  Please indicate managements wishes.

Debbie and I have just returned from the NNG/TW UAF meeting.  On TW, a leakey receipt value was repaired on July 10, 2001 at an interconnect with Williams Field Services.  This caused unmetered gas receipts to flow into TW and there does not appear to be any way to estimated Williams losses.  Starting in August we expect the UAF gains to disappear from TW.  If so, we recommend reversal of the UAF reserves at a time management feels appropriate.   

Until then, TW has another $1 million of UAF gains which we wish to reserve.'

The UAF for 0601 has been reconiled and the accounting gain is 316,474 priced at $3.20.  The impact of the gain is $1,012,717.  This amount should be reserved.  

Let me know if you have questions.

Subject:	Deferred Gain on Sale of Part to Cooper Energy Services

Gary, I'm attaching an accounting memorandum I prepared at year end to establish the methodology for bringing the $4.5MM deferred gain on the Cooper parts sale into income.  The bottom line is that it is to be brought to income pro rata with the satisfaction of the $18MM minimum purchase obligation under the Blanket Purchase Agreement between  Co. 1195 and Cooper. So the amount to be transferred to income in July, 2001 will be $618,772.96 divided by $18,000,000 multiplied by $4,500,000 or $154,693.24.

Also, if you know someone at Harold Powell that would be a great one too!
 
Skip Mumsies - it is no longer in business, I believe, as the number has been disconnected and there is no other listing for it.

"Organization Changes","Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

"IT 2001 C.E. vs 2002 Plan","
James,
For NNG IT, the Capital is up $2.2MM due to new projects and new business.
For NNG & TW, the primary explanations for the net increases in Direct Support are:

	Risk Management moved from Commercial to IT		$.3MM
	SAN 							$.3MM
	O&E Additional Support (staff) and new software		$.8MM
	Amortization - Future Vision Projects			$.3MM	
	EPSC							$.7MM
		Totals to $2.4MM
 
The FA&A ETS Support variance (Measurement) is incorrect on the worksheet:  2001 C.E. is $1.6MM, 2002 Plan is $1.5MM.
I'll get Gas Logistics to you soon.
Thanks,

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

That being said, we received a new request on Thursday night which is another look at some of the information your groups may have already provided, along with some other information.  Attached is a file, with the breakouts and formats as requested by management, containing four (for some of you, five) spreadsheets.  Please complete all of these sheets applicable to your business unit (note: dollars in millions).   The requested timing of the completion of this exercise is by 3pm Friday, November 15.  Please send the completed file back to me as soon as you are finished.  If you have any questions about the format or the contents of the file, please contact Michelle Nezi Marvin at 3-6848.

"RE:","Hello.  Your account has been corporately billed to Enron since 09/20/01.  There is, however, a balanced owed for the final bill under your personal liability for the same number.  We can transfer the entire balance owed to your corporate account with Enron's approval.  Please let us know.  Also, your Assignment & Assumption paperwork indicates that you want the corporate invoices sent to your home address.  If you indeed would like your EID number incorporated to your account for the ""I Buy It"" accounts payable system with Enron, then you will no longer receive paper invoices at home.  These invoices are paid directly on line by Enron Accounts Payable and they receive the invoices at a specific post office box.  Please let me us know what you decide and we can change your account information for you.  Thank you.

"ELM Finance Course Offerings","
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.  
 

For enrollment, or more information on these courses, please log on to http://elm.enron.com.

To:	Hayslett, Rod; Goodrow, Alicia; Bowes, Bill
Cc:	Patrick, Michael K.; Coulter, Jodi; Pernot, Catherine
Subject:	EOTT Gain Calculation

Based on discussions with Bill, there are deferred taxes already recorded on the books for the difference between the book basis and the tax basis in the common units, sub units and APIs.  Therefore, there is no punitive tax expense created in the 3rd quarter by executing the 140 transaction.  The book tax calculations will be just the effective tax rate (approximately 37%) multiplied by the pre-tax book gain.  Accordingly, the tax expense will not result in a non-recurring loss on the sale.  The net gain will be approximately $6 million prior to the effects of the EGM MTM income.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

"RE. Adaytum Update","Below is an update on the Adaytum Consolidated Model:

1) BU Basic Cubes' Training => last week (10/22 - 10/26), two training sessions were held - EEOS and EGAS. Provided in the training sessions were User Documentation, which included screen prints of Manager screens, as well as a word document with additional user instructions and screen shots of the data cubes. Also included were the Adaytum excel add-in reports (both summary and financial statements). Additional training sessions are scheduled for the next two weeks. If you have not done so already, please let me know your availability. The sessions lasts approximately 4 hours, and is done ""on-site"".

NOTE: Most Enron computers have a minimum of 128K of RAM. In order for faster processing of data and accessing the cubes, we are recommending that everyone upgrade to an additional 128K of RAM (totalling 256K RAM). The cost of this upgrade is a nominal amount (under $25), and is well worth the investment.

To check the amount of memory on your machine, please do the following commands:

Start | Settings | Control Panel | System (Look under Computer for the amount of RAM you have).

2) Next Adaytum User Group Meeting => we will not have a meeting this week due to accounting close. However, I will schedule a meeting for next week (time and place to be determined). Potential topics for discussion are: (a) 2002 Plan information input into Adaytum (timeline), (b) Training update, and (c) Integration of actual / plan data between Adaytum and the Data Warehouse. Please forward to me any additional topic you may want to discuss.

Please call me if you have any comments or other items to discuss.

After reviewing the budget yesterday, we noticed that goodwill was still being
amortized in 2002. We need to take that out of your numbers. Jim and Kiri
thought it was approximately $14 million. Thus, PGG should have an IBIT of
$270. Please revise file and send back to me and copy Steve Schwarzbach

Hi Tracy, 

Please see attached for the Plan that Stan Horton will be looking at tomorrow 
morning. This version includes Intercompany interest expense that was not 
previously budgeted. It also has a more detail break-out of capital 
expenditures. 

For the O&M detail pages, we will not be able to give you the same break-out 
for our cost as you have requested. Our GL is build on FERC accounts and is 
not condusive to SAP type sorting. 

Also, note that all O&M are at this point still straight lined for the year. 
The quarterly shaping of earnings will not be available until mid to late 
November. There will be significant swing between quarters from these results 
to the final one. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

We walked Georgetta through the details of the offer and the support for its reasonableness.  Georgetta, at the time of our conversation, did not have the written offer reflected in the attachment, however, we will provide her the written offer this morning.  Georgetta was very appreciative of our offer and said she would discuss the same with her clients on Tuesday.  (Apparently, her main clients are at the Transwestern Customer Meeting today and will be out as a result of Veterans Day on Monday.)  Once we hear back from SoCal Gas we will advise.

"Organizational Announcement Email announcement_Final","Pipeline integrity and safety have risen to new levels of public concern.  In the aftermath of the incidents at Bellingham, Washington and Carlsbad, New Mexico new pipeline safety regulations and legislation will require increased focus on pipeline integrity programs.  As a proactive approach to address these concerns, ETS Operations is establishing a Pipeline Integrity Program Management Group.  This group will be responsible for pipeline integrity issues for EOTT and ETS and financial reporting of EOTT's environmental and remediation projects.  The group will include the following functions:  corrosion, pipeline safety and pipeline integrity.  
 
I am pleased to announce that Mike Nelson will relocate to Houston to lead this new initiative, as Vice President Pipeline Integrity Program Management.  Reporting directly to Mike are Max Brown and Dave Johnson.  
 
The establishment of this new function, along with Mike's move, has given us the opportunity to rotate key staff, allowing us to achieve a broader knowledge base for the future of ETS Operations.  I am pleased to announce the following additional changes:
 
                                                                                 Rick Craig - Vice President Southeast Operations 
                                                                                 Dan Pribble - Vice President Southwest Operations
                                                                                 Randy Rice - Senior Director North Operations 
 
Rick Craig and Dan Pribble will continue to office in Houston.  Randy will transfer to the Omaha office.  
 
Don Hawkins will assume new responsibility for controls & electrical, measurement and the Clifton Machine Shop as Vice President Technical Services.  He will also continue to handle facility audits, quality management, and business development initiatives.  John Shafer, Vice President Environmental, Health & Safety, will continue to be responsible for environmental compliance and remediation, and health and safety.  John Keller, Vice President Planning & Power Services, will assume responsibility for the Beaver Machine Shop in addition to his current responsibilities.  Jerry Martin, Vice President Engineering & Construction, will continue in his current role.
 
The Skill Based Pay Field Training Administration group will now report to Morris Brassfield, Senior Director, Operations Support Services.  
 
All changes will be effective October 1.  Please join me in congratulating these individuals on their new assignments.

"RE: NNG & TW Ad Valorem Tax Accrual - 2002 Plan vs. 2001 Forecast","Property tax liability, in a given tax year i.e. 2002, is directly related to the level of income and asset cost of the prior calendar year i.e. 2001.  As in the case of NNG & TW, income and asset cost are increasing. Therefore, property taxes also will increase.

In order to keep the property tax liability flat, three strategies are available (1) book any gain on the sale of an asset below the line (N.U.O.I.), (2) assets there are no longer in service should be retired from the books of records, and (3) items that can be expensed should be expensed and not capitalized to plant, property, & equipment.

Subject:	NNG & TW Ad Valorem Tax Accrual - 2002 Plan vs. 2001 Forecast

The 2002 Plan reflects an annual property tax accrual increase for both companies of approximately $1.0 MM (NNG $.3 MM and TW $.7 MM) above what is presently being accrued on each company this year. Would you please respond to Tracy on the reasons for the increase between years and also provide a possible strategy for keeping the accrual flat. She will need your response by Friday to cover any question/concerns Stan may have after his review this weekend. Thanks in advance for your cooperation and support.

"Insurance Issues","
	After the budget session, I thought I needed to make sure one more process is started and in order.     Insurance costs have risen and there may be a disconnect between expectations and actual results.    I would like to think that we can develop the proper insurance program for Wessex and other Operating Companies in a short time.    

	I think we will need to determine what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed and then what is the right information to send out in the request for quotes.   	This is so that everyone is dealing with the same information.     I would argue that we should be able to price the deal in the market and then give the group program 	a right to match the deal.    I think the next step is yours, to tell us what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed  and then follow that up with the information 	to go out in the RFP.

	However, it will be necessary to establish some ground rules.     In the event the Operating Company (OC) wishes  to secure a ""market price"" for their insurance:
	1.	The OC may nominate a broker to secure pricing.  The Broker is subject to CRM's (Corporate Risk Management working for EGS-Enron Global Services) 	approval.  Such approval will not be unreasonably withheld.   An appeal of an adverse decision from CRM to the CEO of EGS is possible.
	2.	CRM will specify and the operating company will supply to CRM,  the necessary underwriting information.
	3.	The OC will specify the types of insurance and coverages,  limits, and deductibles they require for their business.
	4.	CRM will provide the underwriting data and coverage specifications to the competing brokers.
	5.	The competing brokers will be directed by and report to CRM during the bid process and thereafter, if the broker is appointed.
	6.	CRM will receive the proposals from the brokers, evaluate and report the results, with recommendations, to the operating company and the appropriate senior 	manager within Enron.
	7.	OC will elect the program and price they  prefer and CRM will have the right to provide such coverage or direct the appropriate broker in the placement of a 	separate program.
	8.	For locations outside the U.S. the OC may request using their nominated broker for servicing their day to day insurance needs, provided the broker becomes 	a ""correspondent"" within the established Enron Broker Network.  This will ensure continued co-ordination of the insurance programs.

	I think a progam like this can get everyone closer to a satisfactory conclusion in the process.     Please let me know your thoughts on the proposed program, 	because obviously we need to get started ASAP.

"FW: Q3 Adjustments - AA&Co. Review","

-----Original Message-----
From: Stevens, Kirk 
Sent: Tuesday, September 18, 2001 1:40 PM
To: Hayslett, Rod; Enron.ENE.Tracy Geaccone
Cc: Piro, Jim
Subject: Q3 Adjustments - AA&Co. Review


Rod, please forward this note to Mark Lindsey ASAP (I can't find his name on
our email address book and I've had trouble with sending him things in the
past).  

Attached is a file that includes unusual accounting adjustments and/or
implementation adjustments we're proposing as a result of our new rate case
order.  These adjustments total $31.3m (IBIT), and $29.8m (Net Income for Q3
2001.  Forecasted results for Q3 we've been sending to you (including our 3rd
Current Estimate) include these adjustments.   Accordingly, not getting AA&Co
concurence on any of these issues will have a negative impact on PGG's Q3
results. 

For entries affecting PGH & PVC (see tab), we need to make sure Enron Corp is
supportive of our treatment.  This is because although AA&Co. Portland will be
reviewing our records and our reasons for the adjustments, they will likely
pass on the AA&Co. Houston any of these items they may question.  This is
because their primary focus is PGE earnings, not PVC or PGH since we don't
report these companies out any place publicly on a stand-alone basis.  We've
passed along the Merger MOU proposal to AA&Co. Portland already since it has
ties to our rate order (and they're thinking about it), but we're waiting to
hear back from you that the other three items on the list are support by you,
then we'll pass them on to AA&Co Portland for review.  Please respond back by
next Monday, Sept 24th to allow us appropriate time to get them reviewed by
AA&Co. 

All the items on the PGE tab have been explained to AA&Co. Portland, and we're
hoping to get their position on these adjustments by next Monday, Sept 24.  We
feel we have good justification for all the adjustments, but some are more of
a stretch than others (when projecting whether or not AA&Co will approve
them).

Please call if you have any questions.  thanks

"FW: Consultant's view on gas transmission into California","I received these comments this afternoon from JPMorgan.     I need to have some help putting together a story to counteract the basics of this story from CERA.

Subject: Consultant's view on gas transmission into California
Importance: High


Rod:

As we discussed here are the bulletts that summarize what we heard from our consultants.

Overall demand picture

Believe it will be 2006 before the California market will get back to 2000/2001 demand levels

          2002            demand down approximately 900 mmcf/d
          2003            demand will be flat
          2004            growth in demand will begin
          2005-2006   return to 2001 demand levels

Reasoning:
   2001 was a dry year - the lack of hydro generation created an additional 600 mmcf/d demand for gas in California
   Anticipated generation capacity overbuild in California - new more efficient power plants with better heat rates will displace older gas fired generation, reducing the amount of gas              required to generate a MW of electricity on the margin
   California electricity rate increases have curtailed demand for power and subsequently, gas

Gas transmission capacity into the state

Over the next two to three years there will be an additional 2.0 Bcf/d of transmission capacity into California
   800 mmcf/d in 2002
   900 mmcf/d in 2003 (Kern River expansion)
   300 mmcf/d               (El Paso conversion of All American oil line and power up)

San Juan basin gas

San Juan basin production is declining

   first half of 2001 vs. first half of 2000 production off by approximately 200 mmcf/d
   Rockies gas will not replace declining production in the San Juan San Juan gas will move closer to Permian pricing


The consultants believe that the combination of these factors will put decontracting pressure on existing transmission into the state of California, and especially the El Paso and Transwestern lines.

However, the ""wild card"" in their view is unforeseen California power demand growth.

As we discussed, JPMorgan would like to hear your views on the above issues.

Please give me a call when you have had sufficient time to digest and we can set up a conference call to make the most efficient use of your time.

Thanks Rod

Brent

Also, when you have had a chance to look at sales gas volume growth please
e-mail the volume numbers to me...thanks

"Corp. Costs for 2002","	Dawn,
	In the files you have sent for the 2002 Corp. Costs you have a column for ETS HQ.  It appears that there are several companies' allocations in that one column.  We will need to see the Co. 366 costs broken out from these other companies.  For example, if you have included costs for Co. 1202 and Co. 1195, these need to be separated out in detail.  Both Co. 1202 and Co. 1195 have employees.  Co. 366 allocates their costs and we will not know the dollars that belong to these other companies without a breakout in your spreadsheet.  Thank you for your assistance.  Should you have any questions please call.

Subject: Weekly Report


Stan/Jim,
 
Following is a list of last week's most salient events.
 
Central America/DR:
 
Guatemala:  MARAD will reply this week as to their position vis-a-vis the reduction of Enron's contingent support from $28 to $10 million.  It is possible they will ask for additional information.  
 
Nicaragua:  Current credit ratings required the funding of approximately $6.3 million into a debt service reserve account (project was allowed to sweep the funds against a corporate guarantee by Enron, which was backstopped by the partners pro-rata to their ownership in the project).  Partners to reimburse Enron their pro-rata share, such that Enron's ultimate outflow will be approximately $2.2 million.  Team tried to get MARAD to agree to alternative solutions but MARAD simply refused citing bad past experience and political implications.
 
Panama:  Team in Houston last week to review the upcoming PPA bids by Elektra (one of the two distribution companies in Panama).  Three issues are worth noting: (i) requirement to post bid bonds (approximately $10 million) will likely need some sort of Enron support (BLM can't get bid bonds on its own although local management continues attempting to do so); (ii) BLM's marginal costs are among highest in Panama.  A preliminary strategy has been mapped out; and (iii) PPA terms are a bit ""one-sided"" in favor of the distributor.  BLM and other market participants have tried repeatedly to get the distco to change terms without success.  
 
Dominican Republic:  El Paso confirmed it can't work with us.  Operationally, the plant is working well.  As noted on an earlier e-mail, EFI's fuel supplier for SECLP, Vitol, asked for a letter of credit or pre-payment terms.  Enron rejected the request.  SECLP bought cargo directly from Vitol.  We are working closely with Tom Moran of ENE credit on these issues.
 
Ecoelectrica:
This week was a very productive week.  Update as follows:  Lender Process:  Based on several conversations this week, lenders have stated they understand that Mirant's insurance package is the result of market conditions.  Lenders are prepared to pursue credit committee approval with the $300 million coverage.  Mirant offered a 6-month only waiver on the deductibles.  Lenders appear content with that option.  ENE insurance has approximately 75% of the underwriters on board with our back-up plan to provide the additional $200 million tranche.  Backup will be used only if credit committee(s) kick back existing coverage.  Mirant to issue a certification of compliance with QF (by Eco) and a legal opinion asap.  Based on the progress this week and the remaining commitment on deliverables, it is expected that the lender's agent can put together the entire lender package and submit it to the lender group by Tuesday of next week.  Finally, Mirant also committed to providing comments (if any) to the Lender Consent Agreement.  ENE and EME have reviewed and provided comments already.  GE Consent:  Mirant committed to sending their ""versions"" of the key documents on the GE buy-out on Friday nite (late).  I have not seen the document but they have repeatedly stated that the documents are ""conforming"".  Union Carbide Guarantee:  Plan to finalize language early next week.  Schedule:  Mirant has committed to fulfilling CP's as early as possible (and is acting on that statement) as long as we can allow them to fund on 12/19.  They state they are confident they can close CP's by earlier than 12/14 and can fund on 12/19.  CSFB has not shed light on the apparent funding (timing) limitation but has offered to investigate further.  
 
APACHI  
 
Philippines: The team did an excellent job of advancing discussions and negotiations with NPC but was unable to move the slow government machinery fast enough to make it to a signing by last Thursday's New York event.  Nevertheless, momentum is high and team continues to work toward a 12/15 agreement date; funding wouldn't occur until early next year. 
 
Guam:  Continue discussions with Mirant and AES with a focus on getting them over the hump on the issue of Enron's contingent obligation to cover the potential shortfall under a GPA buy-out event.  Work continues.  Meetings have been set with Dr. Boyce to discuss his interest in the Guam project.  
 
China:  Unit 2 still scheduled to come back on line on 11/23.  Two likely causes still under investigation (poor vaccum or material design flaw).  Work on capital reduction for Chengdu on hold until discussions are held with Houston to ensure consensus.  In the mean time, several parties have approached us with interest in Chengdu.  On Hainan, team is paying several visits to the new SAFE representatives, first to work on the mid November repayment ($10 million).   Next step would be liquidation.  
 
Europe  
 
Gaza:  Waiting to hear from CCC (partner) on conceptual proposal: ENE to provide limited technical support and financial services support to help put in place cost over-run facility and to help with remaining construction activities and CCC to take our equity (at no cost) and any remaining obligations.  Aim is to eliminate the potential exposure on ENE's $9 million of guarantees.  
 
Trakya:  During meetings in London, OPIC informed us that they had had good meetings with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy.  Government stated they would ""clean up"" arrears but could not do so before January 2002 (presumably there are no budget funds left).  Government committed to work with OPIC on resolving the forex dispute issue but acknowledged that the legal opinion they had sought and received didn't address the issue properly and thus needed additional work to provide the Government with the backing it needed to give the issue resolution.  OPIC agreed to send the Government ""terms of reference"" on their conceptual agreements.  On our question of change in frequency in the distribution of dividends OPIC stated they would expeditiously move to review our proposal, indicating no pre-disposed position against it.  
 
Sarlux:  team continues to prepare to submit response to EPC contractor's claim, as well as our own counter-claim, all scheduled to be submitted on November 30th.   Team continues to work on sorting out technical issues at the plant, including meetings with senior Texaco officials.  
 
ENS:  local team and Adam Overfield worked to resolve remaining issue over final completion certificate.  Issue was related to CO2 emmissions on GT12 vs the EPC contract parameters.  Team has convinced the lender's engineer that issue is of no relevance.  Team is now moving to secure lender approval.  This releases $1.95 million of contingent support by ENE.  
 
Europe Sales Prospects:  IPower submitted preliminary proposals for ENS and Trakya, both well below expectations.
 
Other:  Team is working closely with RAC to come up with updated fair market valuations, cashflow projections by month for the quarter ended Dec. 31, and revised/updated transfer restriction information.
 
Thanks, Mariella
 
Isabel: please distribute to team as customary.

Subject:	La Plata to Bloomfield Drag Reducing Agent Application Proposal

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Thanks for your help on this.

Subject:	2002 PLAN TEMPLATE

Attached is the template to be used for the 2002 Strategic and Operating Plan.  It includes the Income Statement, Indirect Cash Flow Statement, and numerous supplemental schedules.  

As discussed previously, this template requires more detail compared to what has been required in past years.  Some of the detail sheets are linked to certain lines on the summary sheets, so if you encounter an error message regarding a cell being locked, it will be because there is a more detailed sheet for input for that particular item.  Some sheets include check figures, so please make sure these are all reconciled before submitting the file.

A few reminders:
1. Please do not add any lines or alter in any way the 'Format' or 'PRMA' worksheets.
2. Please round all amounts to one decimal place, even within the cell (for example, don't have a cell show 45.2 and have 45.24395135 as the actual number in the cell).
3. Please do not include any embedded links in the file you submit.

With regard to Operating Expenses, there is an SAP Cost Element Mapping worksheet included to assist you in determining where expenses are mapped.

Also, please note that the due date for this file is THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4.

If you have any questions, please contact me (income) or Greg Adams (cash flow).

Thanks,
Steve

We have to send out a partnership budget on Monday, October 1 and would like to get a good handle on which of these charges will be eliminated or reduced substantially at the Friday meeting.  Since we are unsure of the benefit that many of these charges provide to us, it is doubtful that the partnership would approve all of these increases so we don't want to send out a budget that has them in it.  

It is our understanding that you want our questions directed to your group so that you can address corporate planning yourselves.  Please let us know if you need any additional clarification about our questions.

Subject:	La Plata to Bloomfield Drag Reducing Agent Application Proposal

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Thanks for your help on this.

"Operations Rebates","Tracy,

Over the past few months, Rositza has been researching where the rebates related to Operations have been booked because Phil had earmarked them specifically to assist us in achieving our stretch target.  The rebates are not hitting Operations cost centers, and for numerous reasons from Accounting, they cannot be reclassified into the Operations hierarchies.  Since the rebates received are outside of Operations and Phil should get credit for them, I am reducing our stretch for the upcoming forecast for the rebates actually recorded through September and those expected for Q4.  This is a total of $1.0MM.  If you need documentation, I can forward Rositza's research to you.  Let me know if you have questions.

The ""ETS"" forecast we will submit for Operations will only include what will show up in that column for actuals at year end.  It includes our IBIT estimate for co.'s 1202, 184, 42P, 1195.  Any other amounts we have carried there in previous forecasts will be moved to the pipeline where we expect to see the actuals.  This forecast should represent our best estimate of where we will actually end up for the year (as of today!).  We continue to monitor spending closely, and will adjust next month if necessary.

Thanks,  Elaine

Lori -

Sorry I didn't get this to you earlier today, but I was hung up on Enron 3rd qtr deals all weekend and didn't get a chance to work on it until tonight.  I did check it for consistency with Andersen's documentation and everything is consistent.  FYI - I promised Andersen that I would return their original documentation without retaining or distributing any copies, so I will not have their documentation in any company files.  Let me know if you have any questions (713-853-7046).  Thanks.

Subject:	Request: Current Headcount

Hi everyone.  I have yet another request for which I need your input.  Causey is reviewing his budgets/direct reports, and would like to get the most current headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s).  

What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimately reports to Causey.  For instance, this would include the traditional Accounting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support departments.  It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for example, Sally Beck's world).  I say ""department"" because I don't want just accountants, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e. admins, clerks, etc.  If you have a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and we'll discuss.

The data needs to be as recent as possible.  Hopefully, I can get this as of July 31/August 1.  If you have more recent data, that would be great.  At a bare minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, reporting, tax, etc.)  It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible, i.e. by sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a challenge given the timing of the request.  

Additionally, if you can provide me with a ""current estimate"" for the groups you report, that would be ideal.  I know that the official CE doesn't go to that level, but I'm betting that most of you have something that projects your G&A by cost center (or group/dept) for 2001, as of the 2nd CE.

The headcount information is a must have, and the 2001 cost estimate is secondary, although I'd like to ask everyone to strive to provide both.  If you can't provide estimated costs for the groups you report, please call me so we can discuss.

Speaking of the timing, I need this by Wednesday, August 29 at 12 noon.  This will be given to Rick on Thursday morning, so I'll need some time to consolidate the data and to ask you all any further questions.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks, 
Steve

I would suggest that Northern pay 100% and get reimbursed by TW so that NNG doesn't have to post the CIAC as TW does not have this requirement.  The cost should be split as both parties benefit from the project. I assume the split has been agreed to by both Harris and Neubauer.  MK

Steve Harris has asked for a CIAC for 50% of TW's construction costs on the Gray County interconnect.  I assume that this must be posted on the bulletin board the same as any other CIAC.  Is this correct?  

Also, the economics are based on NNG revenues covering both TW's and NNG's capital expenditure.  For recovery purposes wouldn't it be better for NNG to reimburse TW 100% of its costs?  Other wise isn't there a miss-match in that the volumes will be reflected in NNG's rate design with 50% of the cost of service residing on TW's books?

Subject:	FW: Activity Rates for 2002

The ETS standard activity types and their corresponding rates were set at the time of the SAP go live, in July 2000.  With the labor true-up process in place it really does not matter what the standard rates are; at month end the standard rate used when someone exception codes, is trued-up to actual.  During the month you can have a variance before the true-up takes place.  From an O&M standpoint ETS does not utilize the real time reporting feature of SAP due to our cost allocation model.  IF Project Systems is being utilized to manage real-time project costs, during the month, a variance will always exist prior to true up.  Routine rate review and maintenance will limit the variance.

My recommendation is that if adjustments are made they should be coordinated at the ETS consolidated level.  At the time of the SAP implementation Allison Milan conducted a study across the different companies and Accounting set the rates with the participation of HR.  Since going live with SAP the integrity of the ETS standard activity types and their corresponding rates and their application to all cost centers has not been maintained because there is not central control point for this process.

Theoretically they should now be off by the merit increase in 2001.  Each year at merit time would be the logical time to make adjustments to the rates.  An option would be to wait until 2002 merit time and make adjustments based on 2001 and 2002 merit results.  It would also be a good time to synchronize all of the ETS ""F"" cost centers with the same rates.

If I can provide any additional help, please let me know.  Thanks.

All,


This is a follow-up to the email sent several weeks ago concerning activity rate planning for 2002.  

I have begun the process of copying the existing rates planned for December of 2001 to all periods in 2002.   I am currently thru period 5, 2002 and expect to be complete with period 6, 2002 by late today.

Requested actions:

1.  After we are complete it will be the responsibility of each business unit to go in and confirm data and nofity me of any issues.  I expect to be complete by Wednesday of next week which will give you at least a month to review.

2.  Also, please notify me if there are any additional changes to the primary and secondary contact list for your business unit.  I have made the changes that I have received at this point and the current distribution reflects those changes.



Look for a note from me next week that signals completion of the data copy.  If you would like to begin reviewing data thru period 5 please do so.

Thanks, Paul

Call me with any questions at ext 55013.

"Daily Update","
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

"RE: EPPI GPM Oneok agreement","NNG is billing fuel retention on out-of-balance deliveries.

We only collect the 4.5% on the receipt volumes, however NNG is charging fuel based on the receipt plus the out-of-balance delivery.
This out of balance collection goes to trackers.  We could lower the amounts over the 4.5% if NNG stops charging out-of-balance retention when this contract goes short.  (stop charging out-of-balance retention has other problems assocated with it). This contract was consistently short in 2001.  This is not all of the problem but it is the controllable part.  That is, we need to make these two contracts long to the system each month.  Or, put an OBA at Bushton's inlet (The OBA at Bushton's inlet also has other problems assocated with it).

Mike and Steve please confirm my calculations to the contract terms to see if I am correct, also can you set a meeting with Logistics, Regulatory and Tracy Geaccone to discuss. 

The non-controllable factors are NNG's Field fuel rate keeps increasing making it consistently over the 4.5%, and lower gas prices increase the exposure to EPPI.

I have attached a summary and schedules which indicate the following.

EPPI owes Oneok/GPM $339,158.69
Oneok owes NNG	$  92,774.99
Net amount due is	$246,383.70  Per Dan Fancler

Oneok invoices total $301,383.96.  Oneok has not recognized that some months they paid under the 4.45% and owe NNG.
 << File: GPM 101021  101073 Recalculation.xls >> Oneok is pushing hard for the money, so I am turning over the resolution of the differences to NNG marketing and the resolution of the cash payment to Tracy Geaccone and/or Jennifer Lev.

"LaPlata DRA Application Cost Estimate","Tracy,

Below are the rough cost estimates to apply drag reducing agent to the LaPlata to Bloomfield line.

	Facility modifications			$1,665,000

	Cleaning & application			   $165,000

	Re-application every 6 months		   $165,000


The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloomfield and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery.  The cleaning & application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with methanol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application.

For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%.  The re-application time period is also uncertain.  You may want to look at the economics of re-apply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months.

Please let me know of anything else you need.

Thanks,


John

	Please use the attached file for the income to record on companies 0436 and 01A1 related to EOTT income from the ""leased"" assets.

	Note that the O&M to be billed EOTT for company 0436 is rollup AFR-436 less cost center 111795 and for company 01A1 is rollup AFR-1A1 less
	cost center 112109.

	I'll be on vacation next week but if you have any questions leave them on phone mail and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.  It appears I will not have

Hello Tracy,

I wanted to share some conversations that I've had with both Demetrics
and
Hoang this week related to the project.

On of the biggest issue seems to be with resources.  I know that you
guys
have been quite busy with your planning process but it has been very
difficult to get the required information or time from the resources
that
are committed to the project.  This is due to the fact that they
currently
have a heavy workload and cannot dedicate the time necessary for the
project.  It is having an impact on the timeline.  The home office model
could be a lot further along if some of the required information was
delivered as requested.  Also, I am also getting a sense that there is a
lack of ownership with regards to the Adaytum application.  It is
important
that the users have a comfort level with the application otherwise it
will
become very difficult to transition it when the project is over.

We need to think about who will administer the system once it is in full
production.  This individual should be identified and running the
administration duties as soon as possible.  My fear is that without
proper
ownership of the application and a dedicated administrator (at least in
the
short run), it will be very difficult to transition the roles.

We've had some technical issues with the production and development
environment.  Although these issues have been resolved, it has had an
impact
on the timeline.

There are times that the definition for the model is not clearly
articulated
and it has resulted in the redesign of the model.  Much time has been
spent
on gathering business process information from various people which has
caused a delay in the model development.

I hope that we can constructively talk through these issues tomorrow and
produce solutions that will rectify the situation, mitigate the risks,
and
result in a successful implementation.


Our call is scheduled for 1:30 tomorrow but I can be available earlier
if
you would like to discuss this.

Do you want us to include the peanuts and workable lavatory?

Kidding aside.
The trip normally takes 3.7hrs round trip depending on winds/weather etc. 3.7*$4,800=$17,760.
Of course a corporate aircraft can never be compared to commercial travel on cost alone. There is no comparison. It is all in the safety, confidentiality, time effectiveness, customer contact and support, flexibility of routing and scheduling, being free from distractions and interruptions, less stress on executives and retention of key employees. Depending on who is on board, when you weigh the cost of unproductive time using the airlines vs. conducting business with your whole group during a trip you will see the cost expenditure, when you need it,  is invaluable.

Caroline,  What I been told is the following:

	$3,775/hr  fixed costs plus variable costs associated with specific trips i.e. fuel, landing fees, catering etc.

Typically I think an average per hour cost of $4,500 is used.

Gary,  Does this sound reasonable for budgeting purposes?

For the 2002 Plan NNG will budget aviation by function i.e commercial, operations etc.  Therefore each functional area needs to assess their company plane usage and budget accordingly for 2002.

Gary,  Once we have rolled each functional area up to the NNG legal entity level we will be able to provide you with the total NNG aviation budget for 2002.

Subject:	Request: Current Headcount

Hi everyone.  I have yet another request for which I need your input.  Causey is reviewing his budgets/direct reports, and would like to get the most current headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s).  

What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimately reports to Causey.  For instance, this would include the traditional Accounting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support departments.  It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for example, Sally Beck's world).  I say ""department"" because I don't want just accountants, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e. admins, clerks, etc.  If you have a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and we'll discuss.

The data needs to be as recent as possible.  Hopefully, I can get this as of July 31/August 1.  If you have more recent data, that would be great.  At a bare minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, reporting, tax, etc.)  It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible, i.e. by sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a challenge given the timing of the request.  

Additionally, if you can provide me with a ""current estimate"" for the groups you report, that would be ideal.  I know that the official CE doesn't go to that level, but I'm betting that most of you have something that projects your G&A by cost center (or group/dept) for 2001, as of the 2nd CE.

The headcount information is a must have, and the 2001 cost estimate is secondary, although I'd like to ask everyone to strive to provide both.  If you can't provide estimated costs for the groups you report, please call me so we can discuss.

Speaking of the timing, I need this by Wednesday, August 29 at 12 noon.  This will be given to Rick on Thursday morning, so I'll need some time to consolidate the data and to ask you all any further questions.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks, 
Steve

"Utilicorp $1.2 million","

I just wanted to close the loop on the question of deferring the $.7million UCU credit to 2002.  The last we talked, it was decided that we could not defer the credit because of cash target concerns.  If this is still the directive, we will see a positive variance to Third Current Estimate in October of $1.2 million.  

Would you confirm that this is still our decision?  If so, we will include the earnings upside  in our Quarter Forecast next week.

Thanks

So, I can't tell what my exposure is here.  Which line do I use?
The maximum shown on the schedule is $1.1MM   (expand column width on Column A).   Although it looks from the spreadsheet as if $300 to $600K may be more realistic for the compressor fuel tax through 4/01.  However, there could be $11K/month going forward. 
The other issue would be the sales tax on our purchase of personal property from NWP.  Whatever that may turn out to be, it should not be an earnings concern, but would be capitalized as part of the plant.  
If you need more specificity, I suggest you give Dan a call.

John, I have prepared a more formal position regarding the exemption of ""Compressor Fuel"" consumed in a ""continuing business activity"" (Gas services).  Before I submit this position to you, I will circulate my position letter within the company and validate the facts.  
I will be relying primarily on Colorado Regulations 26-102.21 or 39-26-104.1(d.1).  Have these regulations changed recently?  My service may be out of date.
Attached below are schedules for Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption for the audit period.

Dan,
Here is my initial response.  I haven't had time to do too much research on
this, but this preliminarily the Department's position.  Sorry this took so
long  but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority.  jp

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing
accompanying the transfer of cash from Enron to Northwest Pipeline Corp., I
might agree.  But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.

I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.
Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service
to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need
more research on this.

> PENALTY & INTEREST

The disposition of penalty and interest will be resolved at a level above the auditor level.

Title: The West Enters a Bust 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2810;


***********************************************************************

RADICAL SHIFT IN WESTERN MARKET DYNAMICS

The western power markets are entering a bust period as a result of the 24,000 
megawatts of power plant additions and demand decline brought on by last year's 
high prices and the current economic softness. This bust period is likely to 
last for several years. Western gas markets have also entered a bust with the 
delayed start to winter and full storage inventories exerting downward pressure 
on both North American prices and western basis differentials. Through the 
remainder of this year and into well into next, western regional gas and power 
markets will remain soft and possibly weaken further.

*  Power operating reserves should rise to above 15 percent by next summer in 
the Southwest and California, pushing power prices down and improving 
reliability.

*  Power demand is expected to shrink by 11 percent in the fourth quarter; 
market contractions will return demand in 2002 to levels experienced in 1998. 

*  Full gas storage inventories, huge declines in year-over-year demand, and 
the onset of significant pipeline capacity additions will keep a lid on West 
Coast differentials.

Subject: Enron Wind Aviation



Adam / Stan,

I had a follow-up meeting with Gary Fitch regarding Enron Wind's aviation.  Gray indicated the following:

*	Aviation budget number look comparable to operator standards (approx. $1,900 / hour, 600 hour estimate)
*	The plane has a market value of $1.8 - $2.0 million and a book value of $2.2 million
*	Turbo prop charters for trips to Tehachapi would run in excess of $1,100 / hour and may be limited as there are only two qualified operators
*	The Cessna is the only jet suitable for use to Tehachapi based on runway length and altitude
*	Gary will make a site visit before the end of the year

Assuming that of the budgeted 600 hours of operation, only 400 hours would require charter, the cost of charter would approach $0.5 million of the total budget of $1.2 million.  This plus the flexibility of using the plan on longer hauls (e.g., to Houston) make it economically justified.

My recommendation is that based on the current situation, we retain the aircraft.

Tod

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Subject:  West U Soccer's New Skill Development Program



Dear Coaches,

In an effort to continue the development  of the West U Soccer program to
become one of the finest in the city, we have  introduced some innovative
ways to provide the players with greater development  while having fun.

This year we have already introduced once  a week training for all players
who participate in the West U Soccer in house  programs.  From the reaction
I have  received to date this has been very successful.  We plan to
continue to make improvement  in this program to make it the finest in the
city.

In pursuit of this goal, West U Soccer is  sponsoring in conjunction with
Nebo Pro Soccer Academy a skill development  program for our players from
U-6 through U-19.

The goals of this program:

?      To provide players in  their development years the ability to
develop the skills necessary to enjoy the  game.

?      Have fun while  learning

?      Play fun games and  play against other competition.

?      Coach mentoring by  association with pro trainers

Last week was a trial run of the clinic  and I have a child who is a U-6
player.   He had a great time and learned a lot about soccer and wants to
go next  week because he had so much fun.

Nebo has done a great job of developing a  curriculum for all types of
player from the serious to the recreational.  He has assembled a staff of
trainers who  are well recognized.

If you have players who may be interested  in the training, I strongly
recommend that you hand out the attached sign-up  sheet at your next
practice.

Please tell the player who are interested  to bring the form on Sunday
September 23 at 5:00 to West U Elementary Field for  sign-up.

Thank you for your consideration on this matter .

Summary Risk Data as of 11/16/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	83	
Active Physical Positions	38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	345.0 	
VaR ($thousands)	159.4 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	0	
		


Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Subject:	Segments

As you know we are looking into new segments for Enron's reporting. Part of this exercise will be to look at adding to our disclosure in order to satisfy the 
investment community and help them better understand Enron's business. One of the possible items of disclosure is net income on a segment basis. This 
would involve the allocation of debt and therefore interest to the segments similar to what we do for ROE and capital charge calculations. Because this 
could be reported we are taking a harder look at these allocations as we will need to be able to defend externally. 

Although we will not be segmenting based on business units I would like to look at capital structures at the business unit level. This of course will be aggregated 
up to the appropriate segment as they are determined. I am currently focusing on an estimated 12/31/2001 balance sheet for allocation purposes. This is our best 
guess at what would report at year end. We are using the 7/31/2001 actual balance sheet as a starting point and rolling based on the 2nd current estimate turned in
by the business units and adding in any estimated transactions to occur  between now and year end.

I would like to set up meetings with each business unit to discuss their theoretical capital structure and get your ideas sometime EARLY the week of Sept 17.
We will try to make a first pass based on each business units ability to service debt and reasonable credit ratios based on comparables. Please take time 
to think about this and give me a call to arrange a time to meet. Thanks.

Subject:	Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process

The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, ""in progress"" or ""planned"" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

"Re: FW: URGENT REQUEST","Tracy, our current forecast includes a gross bonus accrual of $13m for the
full year (Note that a portion of this amount is capitalize through our labor
loading process - about 33%).  This is significantly below our target level
for the year ($16.5m) and last year's actual payout of $16.7m.  We reduced
these amounts based on our lower that expected performance in Q3 that we've
been discussing.  Early this year we we're accruing at a maximum amount of
$17.6 since our forecasts looked better at the time.
Here' s the layout of how this falls by quarter in the forecast:
Q1 - $4.4
Q2 - $4.4
Q3 - $1.0 (forecast)
Q4 - $3.2 (forecast)
       $13.0

Based on how Q4 results look, we will reassess our accrual levels at that
time.   Let me know if you have any questions.

Hello everyone. Management has begun to look toward the 4th quarter and is
requesting certain information from each business unit. 

I need to know, by 10:30am Wednesday: 

a. Total bonus accrual for 2001 
b. Amount of bonus accrual that is (or will be) accrued YTD through September
2001 
c. Amount remaining to be accrued in 4th Qtr 2001 

Additionally, each CAO* has been asked to compile a list of potential
hurdles/challenges/clean-up items for the 4th Qtr. that will be discussed at
an offsite this week. You may want to touch base with them and make sure they
are aware of this and come prepared. I have sent a reminder message to them
today also. 

Thanks, 
Steve 


*with the exception of EGEP (Jim call me if you want to discuss) 


PS - Faith and Tracy - I'm assuming you guys will coordinate for wholesale and

"TW Forecast","
I had a meeting with Dan Pribble and Barney Brasher this morning reviewing the current status of the TW Operation forecast.  It appears, at this point in time, that we have been able to clear up and cover all the unplanned expenditures, except for a remaining stretch of approximately $1,000,000.   We are working with all entities within ETS Operations on NNG and TW to find ways and means to cover this remaining stretch between the two companies (TW) and (NNG) during the month of December.

Since late October, Barney and his team have uncovered expenses on TW in the amount of approximately $3 million that was not covered in the Fourth Quarter forecast.   We have cleaned up all but the remaining $1 million.

Dan and Barney have both held meetings face to face with the parties involved in forecasting, or lack of it, and are implementing corrective actions.

We really appreciate the massive effort all personnel are taking to help alleviate this situation and we within OSS have implemented tighter controls and reviews on all the Business Units.   We will initiate weekly flash reviews and monitor closely the processing of all expense invoices during the month of December.  If you have any futher insights of means to relieve this situation, please advise.

I need some help on what this is.  Admittedly, it's only $117k, but we only have 3 employees, and will likely have less next year.  Can we discuss?

Subject:	2002 Plan Assessments as of 10/19/01 for EREC

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures.  

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments (""8xxxxxxx"" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses (""52502000"" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

"Nov 8 Schedule for Peggy Fowler","Tracy,
Peggy's flight is scheduled to arrive at 12:06 and depart at 6:55.

So depending on how traffic is, it seems like you could schedule her at
2:30-3:00.  Which would give her enough time to get to the meeting and
enough time to catch the plane given rush hour traffic and the increased
check in time at the airport.

Let Mary and I know if this works for you.

The $195, 323 is correct.  A new allocations worksheet will go out later this week or early next week as there are still a lot of moving targets.  I have attached our latest information including the two page template for your OOC presentation with Louise and the allocations worksheet as well.  Please let me know if you would like to discuss.  I know that your meeting is scheduled for Friday.

Attached is the ENA Allocations Schedule with Revised HR numbers.  In addition, I have once again included a separate file with further support schedules for the various Support Departments.  Please note that the most efficient way to resolve any disagreement with any of the allocations is to contact the Support Department contact directly.  I have included those persons' names on the 2002 Schedule.  I will be happy to assist in answering any questions that I can, but am unable to revise the allocations without a request from that person.

All alloctions will be made based on actuals during 2002.  Actuals will either be assessed on a monthly basis or potentially trued up on a quarterly basis.

Attached please find an updated Allocations schedule from ENA for 2002 Plan.  Please note that the considerable increase in many of the allocations is caused by the decision to include an allocation of bonuses for each support department.  These bonus numbers are based on historical data and are calculated at a high level.  Bonuses were not allocated in the prior year and therefore will cause a considerable variance year on year.

Please contact me with any questions you may have or additional information you may need so that we can resolve any issues in an efficient manner.  After resolution of questions, please provide me your final agreement on these numbers via e:mail.

Thanks,
Edie

Overall, the results from Thursday's open season on our Sun Devil Project were very favorable (see below).  Contract terms ranged from two to sixteen years.

San Juan 	84% subscribed	at targeted transport rate
Phoenix		97% subscribed	at nearly targeted transport rate
Cal Border	77% subscribed	at 61% of targeted transport rate

We obviously have some work to do on the California piece but overall, the market interest supports our efforts to move forward with all due haste to the next level.  With that in mind, we'll begin working on the next steps below:

Next steps-
	 - Finalize Level A hydraulic study (9/7)
- Prepare Level B estimate  (9/30)
	- Schedule on-site ROW reviews (9/10)
- Schedule briefing session with FERC in September
- Issue press release on open season results (week of 9/3)
- Mobilize commercial teams to firm up contracts (week of 9/3)

For now, please regard this memo as highly confidential.  We appreciate everyone's support and hard effort thus far--  now the real fun begins!  Look for more info to follow soon and regularly scheduled project update meetings to begin in September.  

Please call me with any questions / concerns at 853-5559.

"MMF Factors","Per your request we have checked the MMF calculation data for NNG/TW/FGT/Trailblazer to Hyperion and/or SAP as appropriate.  Data checks out.
However, I asked Mary to provide me a copy of the prior year calculation.  It appears that the NNG and TW Fair Value Adjustment companies were included in the calculation this year, but were excluded last year.  A ballpark estimate is that the ETS MMF factor would drop by .1% if the NNG/TW fair value companies were excluded as they were last year.   That would mean a factor of 19.0% rather than 19.1%.


Please call me when you want to discuss IMP.  I'm not sure exactly what you're looking for so trying to answer by e-mail probably wouldn't be very productive.

We will need to see the Co. 366 costs broken out from these other companies.  For example, if you have included costs for Co. 1202 and Co. 1195, these need to be separated out in detail.  Both Co. 1202 and Co. 1195 have employees.  Co. 366 allocates their costs and we will not know the dollars that belong to these other companies without a breakout in your spreadsheet.  Thank you for your assistance.  Should you have any questions please call.

1.b)  Term:   Finance would greatly prefer a right to extend for a period of at least 10 years to be exercised at least 2 years prior to the expiration date.   This would allow for time to find a replacement shipper before the expiration date.   In no case should we agree to an annual evergreen as this is optionality without any cost to them. 
2.      Conduct of Open season/Contract Quantity Reduction:   Need to establish an ""Initial Recourse Rate"" prior to the open season in order for their proposed mechanism to work.  Without it there is no way to measure the ""proportionate reduction"" requested.

It is Pemex's intention to move forward with this LOI with an agreed upon rate (even though it currently says ""To Be determined"") prior to execution.  I will keep you posted as we get more information.  If you have any comments regarding any of these issues, please feel free to contact me, otherwise, please look forward to review our next draft prior to us sending it back to Pemex.

Thanks, 
Kim (X33098)

James,

I believe the Communications for 2002 should be $.2MM in NNG's Gas Logistics...
Anyway...

NNG 2002 increase is due primarily to:
	EPSC			$.3
	Less Capitalized	$.4
	Increase in Benefits	$.15
	Increase in Salaries	$.1
Hope this helps.

TW Fair Value is very similar to Goodwill in that it represents an excess over book value, and is not formally being recoverd in rates; BUT at the time of the  acquistion it was treated as a purchase price allocation an applied to plant.

"Request: Current Headcount","Hi everyone.  I have yet another request for which I need your input.  Causey is reviewing his budgets/direct reports, and would like to get the most current headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s).  

What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimately reports to Causey.  For instance, this would include the traditional Accounting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support departments.  It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for example, Sally Beck's world).  I say ""department"" because I don't want just accountants, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e. admins, clerks, etc.  If you have a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and we'll discuss.

The data needs to be as recent as possible.  Hopefully, I can get this as of July 31/August 1.  If you have more recent data, that would be great.  At a bare minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, reporting, tax, etc.)  It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible, i.e. by sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a challenge given the timing of the request.  

Additionally, if you can provide me with a ""current estimate"" for the groups you report, that would be ideal.  I know that the official CE doesn't go to that level, but I'm betting that most of you have something that projects your G&A by cost center (or group/dept) for 2001, as of the 2nd CE.

The headcount information is a must have, and the 2001 cost estimate is secondary, although I'd like to ask everyone to strive to provide both.  If you can't provide estimated costs for the groups you report, please call me so we can discuss.

Speaking of the timing, I need this by Wednesday, August 29 at 12 noon.  This will be given to Rick on Thursday morning, so I'll need some time to consolidate the data and to ask you all any further questions.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks, 
Steve

Tracy,

10,000 MMBTU/D of incremental capacity from LaPlata to Gallup.

This is the working assumption from our initial conference call.  Like the +/- 30% cost figures below, it may vary with further evaluation, but I suggest it be used for this initial analysis.

Thanks,


John

Subject:	LaPlata DRA Application Cost Estimate

Tracy,

Below are the rough cost estimates to apply drag reducing agent to the LaPlata to Bloomfield line.

	Facility modifications			$1,665,000

	Cleaning & application			   $165,000

	Re-application every 6 months		   $165,000


The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloomfield and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery.  The cleaning & application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with methanol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application.

For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%.  The re-application time period is also uncertain.  You may want to look at the economics of re-apply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months.

Please let me know of anything else you need.

Thanks,


John

"FW: 2002 Plan Allocations from ENA to Other Business Units","	Here is the reply from Edie on the question of the additional 100,000 in the 2002 Wholesale budget to ETS.

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Leschber, Edie  
Sent:	Wednesday, October 24, 2001 2:52 PM
To:	Botello, Mary
Subject:	RE: 2002 Plan Allocations from ENA to Other Business Units

eSource is based on your current year usage as a percentage of total current year usage.  The amount is simply a guideline and charges will only be incurred if you use eSource in 2002.

The additional amount for IT Infrastructure relates to a passthrough to Other Business Units of Infrastructure charges allocated to ENA from ENW.  The basis for this is a calculation of FTE's based on 2002 Planned allocations from ENA support departments to your business unit.  You are then charged a % of that support department's Infrastructure charges applicable to the FTE's.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Edie

Subject: Happiness 


  We convince ourselves that life will be better, after we 
  get married, have a  baby, then, another. 

  Then, we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough, and, 
  we'll be more content when they are. 

  After that, we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. 
  We will, certainly, be happy when they are out of that stage. 

  We tell ourselves that our life will be complete, when our spouse 
  gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, we are able 
  to go on a nice vacation, or, when we retire. 

  The truth is, there's no better time to be happy, than right now. 
  If not now, when? 

  Your life will, always, be filled with challenges. 
  It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy, anyway. 
  Happiness is the way. 

  So, treasure every moment that you have and treasure it more, because 
  you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time 
  with... and, remember, that time waits for no one. 

  So, stop waiting.... 

  - until your car or home is paid off 
  - until you get a new car or home 
  - until your kids leave the house 
  - until you go back to school 
  - until you finish school 
  - until you lose 10 pounds 
  - until you gain 10 pounds 
  - until you get married 
  - until you get a divorce 
  - until you have kids 
  - until you retire 
  - until summer 
  - until spring 
  - until winter 
  - until fall 
  - until you die 

  There is no better time, than right now, to be happy. 
  Happiness is a journey, not a destination. 

  So, work like you don't need money, 
  Love like you've never been hurt, 
  And dance like no one's watching.

10,000 MMBTU/D of incremental capacity from LaPlata to Gallup.

This is the working assumption from our initial conference call.  Like the +/- 30% cost figures below, it may vary with further evaluation, but I suggest it be used for this initial analysis.

Subject:	LaPlata DRA Application Cost Estimate

Tracy,

Below are the rough cost estimates to apply drag reducing agent to the LaPlata to Bloomfield line.

	Facility modifications			$1,665,000

	Cleaning & application			   $165,000

	Re-application every 6 months		   $165,000


The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloomfield and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery.  The cleaning & application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with methanol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application.

For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%.  The re-application time period is also uncertain.  You may want to look at the economics of re-apply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months.

Please let me know of anything else you need.

Thanks,


John

Subject:	SAN JUAN IMBALANCE GAS ANALYSIS

Attached is a draft analysis of comparing revenues from different uses of some of the TW excess retained fuel for this year:

Keep San Juan shippers whole and get imbalance gas back by year end

Cut San Juan shippers deliveries and sell excess retained fuel right away

A break even settled San Juan imbalance gas cash out price is determined.

If the settled cash out price is above $4.23/MMBtu, keeping the shippers whole is a better alternative.

Please review and comment on the draft analysis and make sure that I didn't misinterpret the information provided by you.

Thanks!

Tracy recommended that we schedule an informal 2002 O&M and Capital plan review with her and Rod before the official deadline (08/27).  I checked the outlook calendars and everybody appears to be available on Friday (08/24) from 1:30 to 3 pm.  Could you please confirm this with Rod and Tracey and coordinate Morris' schedule with Debra.  Elaine and I are available.

Thanks,

"Oneok Claim on EPPI","
EPPI Claim for 2000-2001

Enron Processing Properties, Inc (EPPI)  assignment of the GPM Agency Agreement committed EPPI to reimburse KN (now Oneok) for all-in transportation rates above 4.45%.  NNG's must bill minimum rates and those rates are sometimes above the 4.45% all-in rate, therefore Oneok has submitted invoices for transport excesses of $79,165 and $222,315 for the years 2000 and 2001.

The invoices are currently being checked by Gas Logistics and once a final determination has been made coding instructions will be needed for this EPPI commitment.


Prior Claim (1997-1999)

On 2/18/2000, KN submitted a claim for $363,211 covering 1997-1999, I checked the calculations and the claim was revised to $192,000.

During negotiations KN sold the agreements to Oneok and to my knowledge the prior claim was never paid nor were any more demands for payments made.

"FW: TW Daily Balance Report"," The attached file has July 2001 and September 2001 analyzed.

I have compared the TW Balance Report to Actuals for July 2001 (see attached spreadsheet) and feel that the Fuel Retention numbers are good.  The Fuel Burned numbers are generally too low due to missing 3-days of actuals and some fuel meters are inputted only once a month and will be missing from the balance report.  However, when you use Ken's report just estimate the fuel numbers 25% higher and you will be OK.

The remaining volumes (Retention less Fuel less Sales) will equal imbalances and UAF.  Ken's report (area under construction) needs work to solve the imbalance question and we can discuss this next week.  He will be in Houston Monday and Tuesday.

Also, I want to make one thing clear.  Sales go to the bottom line, however if your selling imbalance gas received from a customer or line pack you will have an expense offset that also goes to the bottom line.   Conversely, if you are repaying (giving) gas to a customer you will have an expense credit that goes to the bottom line.  Over-retained gas (Retention less Fuel less UAF) is the only bottom line amount.  You can sell the gas outright or sell it to the customers imbalance or linepack.  If you sell it to linepack or volume valued imbalances, you will have taken on commodity risk.  We can discuss TW's risk profile next week.

Please find attached the preliminary 2002 EREC earnings and cash flow plans.  This is a preliminary draft only.  As discussed with Tod, the operating cost line has been adjusted at a summary level to achieve the IBIT target agreed to during Friday's review with Stan Horton.  The actual adjustments made to arrive at the final plan will involve different timing and P&L lines.

Please contact me at (661) 823-6467 if you have any concerns.

"Here's the scoop on the Financial meetings","Here's the scoop as I know it as of 3;15 today.

2002 Commercial Plan mtg for McCarty, Thursday, August 16th
As of 8/14 @ 2:40, Danny advised that the meeting will proceed BUT, suggested that they break at 10:00 and attend the Enron All -Employee meeting and reconvene at 11:00 - 1:00. Note the lunch will be delivered at 11:30.
Tracy & John, can you arrange the Agenda accordingly and reminder that Eric Gadd will be leaving at 12:00 so his area should be covered before then.  Can we achieve the business goals with the break?  Is this ambitious?
If you want to extend the meeting time, I have extended the conference room (49C2) till 1:30.  The conference room is booked at 2:00 by Steve Harris/Drew Fossum but, I could ask them to adjust their meeting if more time is needed. Please advise.

Quarter Forecast Review w/ Stan, Wednesday, August 22nd 
CANCELED as per Tracy on 8/13

NNG/TW Actuals alias CBR meeting, Friday, September 14th at 1:30
A request from Deb/Dave's office to reschedule as Dave had conflict and can not attend. I followed up with Cindy on July 26th & 27th and Cindy suggested that Danny talk to Stan.  I reminded Danny to discuss with Stan at the July 30th staff meeting.  No discussion or resolution.
Note that a CBR update was completed on July 11th and as per Tracy, the information would be fairly current to update Stan.  A NB Strategy meeting was also completed on July 19th in Omaha.
8/14, as per Tracy, Stan referred back to Danny.  Danny suggested canceling and thought we had already done so.  I advised him that the Quarter Forecast Review w/ Stan was canceled but, not this particular meeting. CANCEL??  

3rd CE Review w/ Stan, Tuesday, September 18th
Confirmed on Danny's calendar

"FW: PGE Power Costs","FYI

Subject: RE: PGE Power Costs


Gay, here's the story and some numbers for the Q3 comparison.  Please remember
the context of our phone conversion this morning when looking at this. 
Hopefully this helps Investor Relations put the story together for the
Earnings Release.

Power Cost Adjustment 
We now expect to have an amount collectable from customers to record all Q3 of
$86m.  Since we we're basically at the deadband level at the end of Q2, we end
up eating our way through the deadband and up into the 90% collection band all
in Q3.  On a stand alone basis, we will incur  about $54m of net variable
power costs Q3 that we won't have any revenues for (but remember to keep this
in context for the entire 9-month period).  The following shows how this is
calculated:

Projected Net Variable Power Costs = $316m
Baseline for PCA = $176m
Difference Subject to PCA Collection = $140

Deadband  = $35m  (no collection)
50/50 band = $21m (collect $10.5m, no collection = $10.5)
90/10 band = $84m (collect $75.5m, no collection = $8.5)

The bands above = $140m ($35+21+84)
Collections = $86m ($10.5+75.5)
No Collection (PGE eats) = $54m ($35+10.5+8.5)

Again, without the PCA mechanism and no other price increase between 1/1/01
and 9/30/01, PGE would be $90m worse off.  As we discussed, before pulling our
request for a rate increase to be effective 1/1/01 (which was replaced with
the PCA mechanism), the latest amount being offered up by our PUC would have
been around a $90m increase for the 9-month period (although the evidence was
quickly moving towards no need for an increase, so we probably wouldn't have
got the rate increase, and without a PCA, would have been worse off today).  

Quarter to Quarter Comparison - Margins
As we discussed, things were looking really good for us through Q2 2001, but
price caps and other factors in late Q2/early Q3 really dropped the price we
could sell our excess power for, and accordingly has dropped our margins.  In
addition, a slowing economy and customer energy efficiency measures have
resulted in significant reductions in our retail revenues compared to last
year.  

Another point on the this year/last year quarter to quarter comparisons is
that we went into Q3 2000 with length purchased at fairly low/reasonable costs
over the prior year or so.  In Q3 2000, wholesale sales prices increased
dramatically (California market) so we made tremendous margins (above normal).
 Going into Q3 2001, much of the power we purchased was at higher prices than
the previous year because of the higher wholesale power market operating over
the past year.  When price caps and other events dropped the bottom out of the
wholesale power prices, our margins on our power lenght dropped dramatically. 
The PCA only picks up a power of this increase in net variable power costs, as
outlined above.  Also remember that we have a regulatory obligation to serve
our customers, so we have to go into a month with length in order to ensure we
can handle any potential load spikes or unplanned plant outages.  Any excess
power is sold in the wholesale market in the day-ahead or real-time markets.  

Big story, price caps and lower retail revenues have really hurt us year to
year, but our new rate case effective 10/1/01 should get us back on track. 

Gross Margin Comparisons
Based on our latest forecast, here's a breakdown of our gross margins on a
year to year comparison for Q3.  This gives you a high level look at the
impact the above events have had on our margins year to year ($94m decrease in
gross margin).

                                            Q3 2000                 Q3 2001
Retail Revenues                    $257m                   $250m
Wholesale Revenues               466m                    571m
Other Revenues                            5m                       5m
Variable Power Costs                523m                    715m
Gross Margin                           $205m                  $111m

Attached is my attempt to summarize the PGE power cost issue.  Please
call me to discuss.  I have no pride of authorship - just want to make
sure it is simple as possible while still being correct.  I will be here
until about 6:30 my time.  Thanks!

"Forecast for MGT","At Third Current Estimate, we added a full year forecast for MGT for Operations and added the MGT and Border amounts together on the Border page in the ETS Functional Income Statement as instructed.

We are trying to confirm what we should be reflecting.  Jason is being instructed that ETS should not pick up any actuals for January through May, and that we should use Actuals received from El Paso for June forward, and not our numbers.  The El Paso amounts for June through September are close to what we have, but not exact.

Please advise us as to what we should be reflecting and we will revise our schedules.  We did not pick up MGT at all until 3rd CE, so I'm OK with restating 3rd CE to reflect the appropriate amounts for MGT and rolling forward from there.

Subject:Request: Current Headcount 

Hi everyone. I have yet another request for which I need your input. Causey is
reviewing his budgets/direct reports, and would like to get the most current
headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s). 

What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimately
reports to Causey. For instance, this would include the traditional
Accounting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support
departments. It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for
example, Sally Beck's world). I say ""department"" because I don't want just
accountants, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e. admins, clerks, etc. If
you have a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and
we'll discuss. 

The data needs to be as recent as possible. Hopefully, I can get this as of
July 31/August 1. If you have more recent data, that would be great. At a bare
minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, reporting, tax,
etc.) It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible, i.e. by
sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a challenge given
the timing of the request. 

Additionally, if you can provide me with a ""current estimate"" for the groups
you report, that would be ideal. I know that the official CE doesn't go to
that level, but I'm betting that most of you have something that projects your
G&A by cost center (or group/dept) for 2001, as of the 2nd CE. 

The headcount information is a must have, and the 2001 cost estimate is
secondary, although I'd like to ask everyone to strive to provide both. If you
can't provide estimated costs for the groups you report, please call me so we
can discuss. 

Speaking of the timing, I need this by Wednesday, August 29 at 12 noon. This
will be given to Rick on Thursday morning, so I'll need some time to
consolidate the data and to ask you all any further questions. 

If you have any questions, please give me a call. 

Thanks, 
Steve

"UNCLAIMED PROPERTY REPORTING - F. Y. I.","Jerry, I received a copy of an email you addressed to Bill Brown regarding a conversation you had with Karen Choyce about who is responsible for Unclaimed Property Reporting to the States.  The Corporate Secretary Division centralized this function a few years ago and I am the person responsible for making sure that Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries stay in compliance.

I think Karen meant that it is the responsibility of each business unit to identify the unclaimed checks, move the funds to the Escheat Liability Account, communicate this information to the Corporate Secretary's Division, and reconcile the general ledger as it pertains to their business unit.

It is my responsibility to prepare the reports and remit the funds to the applicable state before the deadline.  Please forward any correspondence you receive from the States regarding this matter (including notices and forms) to my attention for further handling.  Thank you for your cooperation.

              We convince ourselves that life will be better, after we 
              get married, have a  baby, then, another. 

              Then, we are frustrated that the kids aren't old enough, and, 
              we'll be more content when they are. 

              After that, we're frustrated that we have teenagers to deal with. 
              We will, certainly, be happy when they are out of that stage. 

              We tell ourselves that our life will be complete, when our spouse 
              gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, we are able 
              to go on a nice vacation, or, when we retire. 

              The truth is, there's no better time to be happy, than right now. 
              If not now, when? 

              Your life will, always, be filled with challenges. 
              It's best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy, anyway. 
              Happiness is the way. 

              So, treasure every moment that you have and treasure it more, because 
              you shared it with someone special, special enough to spend your time 
              with... and, remember, that time waits for no one. 

              So, stop waiting.... 

              - until your car or home is paid off 
              - until you get a new car or home 
              - until your kids leave the house 
              - until you go back to school 
              - until you finish school 
              - until you lose 10 pounds 
              - until you gain 10 pounds 
              - until you get married 
              - until you get a divorce 
              - until you have kids 
              - until you retire 
              - until summer 
              - until spring 
              - until winter 
              - until fall 
              - until you die 

              There is no better time, than right now, to be happy. 
              Happiness is a journey, not a destination. 

              So, work like you don't need money, 
              Love like you've never been hurt, 
              And dance like no one's watching.

"RE: Adaytum Invoices Issues","Pat,

I mentioned to Jan that I would provide ETS (and other BUs) with specific Adaytum project expense coding which has been used for previous training classes. She said it didn't matter to her if the business units coded their additional training classes to its own expense account, without charging the costs directly to the expense work order which Project Sunrise set up. Therefore, you do not need to transfer the costs which you have already coded to expense on ETS' books.

Thanks !

Tracy,
Joe Darensbourg called me today asking about some invoices he received from Adaytum for Contributor Administrator and Advanced Analyst training that I am scheduled to take.  I told him that I had already expensed and sent a check to Adaytum for these two classes.
He, Joe, called me later to ask if I had coded this training to one of the Adaytum projects, namely an O&M project.  I told him I did not.  He said he would send me an email with the project(s) number(s).  I haven't received it as yet.
Lee wants to be sure that you are aware of this since we don't have any way of monitoring what is coming from Adaytum direct to Enron.
Thanks,

Pat,

Thanks for letting me know about the Adaytum invoice issue that Joe Darensbourg contacted you about.  I have not been involved in any of the invoicing with Adaytum, Tracy Geaccone is handling that for ETS. 

Would you please e-mail Tracy and let her know the particulars of this issue.   I assume Joe has taken care of it, but I would like to keep her in the loop on any cost or invoice issues.

Thanks.

Subject:	Summary of Commission Meeting



The Commission meeting yesterday, chaired by Pat Wood, consisted of discussions on FERC's:

Administrative Issues
?	Strategic and 2002 Business Plan
Priorities for the strategic plan for 2001 through 2005 were outlined yesterday and include a) promoting secure, high-quality environmentally responsible energy infrastructure with consistent policies; b) encouraging competitive markets in lieu of traditional regulation; c) protection of markets/customers through fair market oversight; and d) efficiently running FERC. In reaching these goals, FERC intends several initiatives such as removing impediments to market investment, encouraging use of new technology; continuing to advance competitive markets; addressing landowner, safety and environmental concerns and striving for clarity not only in specific areas such as cost recovery but also in communications to stakeholders. Shortly, Staff will be recommending a twelve-month plan as part of the overall strategic plan.
?	Infrastructure Adequacy
There will be a series of open commission meetings held throughout the U.S. beginning in November in the West; in December or early spring a meeting will be held in the northeast and later in 2002 for the Midwest and south. The intent is to reach out to the states for greater cohesion.
?	California Infrastructure Update
Staff concluded that the California natural gas market for take-away capacity was insufficient to accept delivery of all interstate capacity. The California Energy Commission released a report on September 24 that agrees that more expansion in California is needed. 

Constraint Study
FERC will complete a constraint study with associated costs that should be completed by November 7, 2001. Staff cited constraints in central New York state and California. Massey asked if the study was to provide solutions or recommendations. It is a study to identify the constrained areas and the resulting costs to consumers.

RTO
FERC is imposing additional ""incentives"" to encourage the formation or joining in RTOs. The Midwest, Northeast and Southeast RTOs will be considered at a FERC meeting in October. There will be a series of meetings in ""RTO week"" to focus on congestion management, cost recovery, marketing monitoring, transmission planning, reliability standards and transmission rights. A NOPR is expected to be issued on market design and structure.

Marketing Affiliate NOPR, RM01-10
The Notice of Propose Rulemaking would apply one set of rules across both natural gas pipelines and electric utilities. Under the proposal, transmission providers must operate independently and treat all customers on a nondiscriminatory basis.  The rules would be codified in a new section of the regulations and would broaden the definition of affiliate to include all ""energy affiliates.""  The only exception noted in the discussion was the exclusion of Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) from the definition of energy affiliates.    

The Commission was presented two options to address the applicability of the rule to public utilities' native load merchant functions.      

Option A:  Status Quo - the rule would not apply to the bundled retail merchant function.
Option B:  The rule applies to the bundled retail merchant function and would prohibit merchant employees from having access to the control room of the utility. 

After extensive discussion, the NOPR was approved 4-0 with additional language added on behalf of Commissioner Breathitt to state that Option B may not be included in the final rule and encourage comments by affected parties and the States.

Massey questioned whether the NOPR is primarily focusing on broadening the definition of ""energy"" affiliate and whether there are any energy-type affiliates that would be exempt. Staff responded that the emphasis is on broadening the definition to include all ""energy affiliates"" and no energy-type marketing affiliates would be exempt, except RTO's.

The proposed rule extents the current prohibition against disclosing certain information to all ""energy affiliates"".  The rules do not directly govern energy affiliates, but they govern the disclosure of information and the separation of transmission employees, officers and directors from other businesses. 

Under the proposal, waivers may be requested, if operationally required or under emergency protocols particularly for small systems.

Gas Pipeline Operational Flow
FERC has tabled this item for the next public meeting on October 11.

"SEC Information/Earnings Restatement","
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Subject:	Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process

The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, ""in progress"" or ""planned"" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

Subject:	RE: NNG & TW Ad Valorem Tax Accrual - 2002 Plan vs. 2001 Forecast

Property tax liability, in a given tax year i.e. 2002, is directly related to the level of income and asset cost of the prior calendar year i.e. 2001.  As in the case of NNG & TW, income and asset cost are increasing. Therefore, property taxes also will increase.

In order to keep the property tax liability flat, three strategies are available (1) book any gain on the sale of an asset below the line (N.U.O.I.), (2) assets there are no longer in service should be retired from the books of records, and (3) items that can be expensed should be expensed and not capitalized to plant, property, & equipment.

If you have any other questions or comments, please advise.

The 2002 Plan reflects an annual property tax accrual increase for both companies of approximately $1.0 MM (NNG $.3 MM and TW $.7 MM) above what is presently being accrued on each company this year. Would you please respond to Tracy on the reasons for the increase between years and also provide a possible strategy for keeping the accrual flat.

Would you please forward me the CAPEX numbers when Tracy e-mails them to you?  Jayshree indicated that she needs those numbers and it will be easier to send in soft form.

Also, to confirm the numbers in the information you gave me are 30.86 MM for 2001 (this does not include Red Rock) and $68.4 in 2002 (this includes $47 MM for Red Rock).  I am assuming that on page three of the 2001-2003 projections that really captures 2002-2004 the operations numbers are in 000s not millions as noted above.  If this is true you have 15 billion in operations CAPEX - which I don't believe is true.  Let me know.

In July 2001 TW had a UAF gain of 93,400 dt valued at $258,718.00 which will be recorded in August business.

As expected the UAF gain was reduced after the July 10 repair to the receipt value at the Williams interconnect.  In my opinion a reserve of the $258,718 July gain is not necessary since we currently have $4.3 million already set up and the lack of recourse available to Williams.  Please indicate managements wishes.

Debbie and I have just returned from the NNG/TW UAF meeting.  On TW, a leakey receipt value was repaired on July 10, 2001 at an interconnect with Williams Field Services.  This caused unmetered gas receipts to flow into TW and there does not appear to be any way to estimated Williams losses.  Starting in August we expect the UAF gains to disappear from TW.  If so, we recommend reversal of the UAF reserves at a time management feels appropriate.   

Until then, TW has another $1 million of UAF gains which we wish to reserve.'

Yes, May has been received.  I've tied out the fuel retained, used(slightly off,but that's probably ppa's), linepack sales, & electric fuel.
I'm trying to tie out imbalances.  They are off.  Ken, is putting a B.O. schedule together by contract so I can tie back to the CBS summary report.  Once that's done, it good to go.

Please see attached.

 << File: TW Daily Balance.pdf >> 

I have added the Linepack change to the report, as we discussed in our last meeting. This information is in the last column, column ""U"", on the report. The cell calculates the change in linepack from the previous day. Linepack readings are taken at the end of each gas day.

Please call me if you have any questions.

The dollars will be spent on purchasing the SAN (Storage Area Network) equipment.  This $4.9 was not in the 2001 capital budget nor reflected in any other quarterly or current estimates.   cvb

"ETS resource requirements","Tracy,

I spoke with Fred and we have a resource available to assists with the remaining ETS modeling and development.  Dymetrix can be here this Wednesday and will be dedicated to ETS through the end of the year.  He will be responsible for the completion of the O&M model for home office.  He will also be responsible for the Marketing initiative.  

I spoke to Ben Humann about Omaha's resource needs.  They will require a resource for two weeks starting November 12th to implement the O&M contributor model.  If they should decide to move forward with development of a full financial system, they will require an additional six weeks of time at a minimum.  We will scope their financial system requirements during the initial two weeks to better determine what the actual recourse requirements will be.

As we discussed this morning I will be dedicated to ETS through the end of January.  I will address the remain issues with Operations.  I address data transfer issues between Adaytum and the Data Warehouse.  I will assist with and manage all of the above initiatives.

Please feel free to contact me if you have and questions or concerns.

Thanks
Hoang Vo

Hello everyone.  I know that many, if not all of you, have worked on numerous requests/initiatives from the office of the chair and other teams lately.  That being said, we received a new request on Thursday night which is another look at some of the information your groups may have already provided, along with some other information.  Attached is a file, with the breakouts and formats as requested by management, containing four (for some of you, five) spreadsheets.  Please complete all of these sheets applicable to your business unit (note: dollars in millions).   The requested timing of the completion of this exercise is by 3pm Friday, November 15.  Please send the completed file back to me as soon as you are finished.  If you have any questions about the format or the contents of the file, please contact Michelle Nezi Marvin at 3-6848. For any other questions, please call Mark Lindsey at 3-1873.

Thanks,
Steve

I would also like to begin to add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.   Accounting quite possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again.

"FW: Sun Devil D R A F T and meeting notice","I won't guarantee I can make it, but I will try.     Here are some thoughts, as we move forward with this deal:

Levelized rates - will require separate rate base, not rolled in, since the base system is not levelized and separate tariff schedules like a FTS-2
	Also we need to see what the GAAP income statments will look like and what the return on equity will really look like if we do this.    It may surprise some of the 	people.    I also think we need to make sure Stan is OK with the potential result if we are going to offer it.

"FW: Additional followup earnings release questions from Tony Jackson","

Here are the answers to questions 1, 2, & 4:

1.  What percent of TW's volumes transported during the 3rd Qtr 2000 and 3rd Qtr 2001 was firm
     vs. interruptible?


		   	       	            2000 			            2001
  				July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
IT Percentage			.09	.09	.09	 	.10	.08	.07
Firm Percentage		.91	.91	.91		.90	.92	.93


2.  What percent of TW's pipe capacity was used during  3rd Qtr 2000 and 3rd Qtr 2001? 
 
		   			2000 			            2001
West flow information		July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
Percentage flow vs. capacity	.90	.95	.97 	 	 100	 100	 .91


		   			2000 			            2001
East flow information		July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
Percentage flow vs. capacity	.81	.85	.86	 	 100	 100	 .91

4.    On James Weitekamp's ""ETS Selected Financial and Operating Highlights"" schedule, transport 
      volumes are shown as being higher for 3rd Qtr 2001 as compared to 1st Qtr 2001.  This doesn't 
      really make sense considering 1st Qtr is a peak time and 3rd Qtr is not.  Why does this difference
      exist?
 
     July and August are peak times for TW.  However, during the 3rd quarter volumes flowing 
     East to West decreased due to pricing.  Volumes significantly increased from East to East because 
     pricing was better, increasing total throughput for the 3rd quarter.

"RE: 4 Quarter Update","We are turning into Corp today, (3CE), (34.9).  This is a variance of (8.3) to what you have below.

NEPCO = (8.5) - due to project profit adjustments on LS Power/Kendall, IL, Cogentrix/Jenks, OK, and E.Coast Power/Linden, NJ.
EEOS =      .2 - Puerto Rico 2.0, Bonus accrual (1.0), and misc. other (.8).

FYI,  We are currently looking at the NEPCO projects to see if they require further writedowns.

Are we reporting the 4Q through EGS and not Wholesale?  Please let me know.

"RE: Benefits Costs","You know, I am just too busy to deal with the tone of your messages right now.   Give me a contact at AA and as soon as I finish my budget and pricing projects I will call them directly.    

Before I can do anything, I need the Enron company number for EGP fuels. I do know that our actuary has never broken out the expense or PBO for this company.  Until I know what the company number is we won't know which ETS group it was consolidated within.  Probably the Services Group, but maybe Corp.  Once we know that then either the ETS accounting or corp. accounting can look into the actual intercompany allocations if any.  Tracy, can you do me a favor and look into how you all do the accounting for this company and I'll try to give you a call later this week.   (Tracy, I may be able to locate the 2000 and possibly the 2001 allocation sheets but I am  not comfortable that we will still have the budget information for 1998 and 1999.  In addition, the true-ups definately do not go to this level.)

Arthur Anderson is in the process of completing the preparation of audited financials for EGP Fuels Company.  Included with these financials are footnote 
	disclosures.  Please provide the following information to be included with these financials.

	1)  Total charges from Enron Corp for EGP Fuels employee benefit plans for 1998, 1999, and 2000.  (I would think that the books of EGP should show the actual charges.  Our reserve records only provide a total distribution allocation.  This will have to come from accounting.)

	2)  EGP Fuels' Enron Retirement Plan pension costs for 1998, 1999, and 2000.  (As stated, this is not prepared at the EGP level.  The best we can do here is to work with the actuary to do an estimate of the costs but this will likely require a historical pull of information which you may or may not have available. I'll need to speak with AA&CO directly to determine best course of action.)

	3)  EGP Fuels' Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO) for benefit plans other than pensions net periodic postretirement benefit costs for 1998,
	     1999, and 2000.  (Same as above.)

	Cynthia,

	Please note that Sandy and I did talk but I was left with the expectation that I would still receive some type of response, even if that response was merely that 
	the information is not available.   Also, it was suggested that I try contacting You, Mikie and Sandy for this information but I did not receive a response from 
	any of you without additional proding.  And, those responses left me believing that I would hear more from you, which I did not.  Lastly, I did mention that if
	necessary we could look at using Financial Accounting for this information but this is not desirable since this method will result in fragmented and less 
	accurate information.  Also, Arthur Andersen has indicated that this is not the preferred method of providing this information.  

	Based on the email which follows below I will assume that Financial Accounting is my only recourse and that You will assist in convincing Arthur Andersen
	that this is the only alternative available to meet their timing requirements.

Sandy told me she talked with you last week in the elevator lobby.  Just so you know I am not ignoring you I have literally worked 4 weeks straight without a day off and with an average of 14 hour days!  

I can not do this until my budgets and medical pricing are complete.  If you need it immediately, then you will need to do what Sandy talked with you about last week and that is to get with Financial Accounting.  There is no way I can look at this until later this week.

Maria,  See the attached.  I believe you will set up the co. 0062 and 0085 FAR orders.

Miriam, I believe you will set up the co. 1195 FAR orders but you need to check with Silvia first.  I think you will also set up the co. 0584 FAR orders but check with Barney first.

Ruthann,
Although there are people in the co. 0584 cost centers right now, they are in the process of being moved to other pipeline companies by 01/01/2002.  There will be no employees on co. 0584 after the first of the year.

Thanks to all,

We have been instructed to begin charging all floor space and related charges to FAR orders for all pipeline employees. I was advised that the FAR orders to be used should be xxxx20009999, which is ""G&A Custom Variant - Asset Not Specific"".

I've looked up all xxxx20009999 FAR orders in SAP and determined which cost centers for Houston employees need to have this FAR order set up. Attached is a spreadsheet showing the FAR orders which need to be created.

Please call me if you need any additional information, and let me know when the FAR orders are created.

"PGE 2002 Capital Costs and IT Detail","Hello, following up our PGE Budget presentation I am forwarding you the
following information.

Jessica - the 2002 Capital Slide has been revised to be consistent with
the NNG disclosure schedule.  The decommissioning forecast is up by $1.6
MM, however since this is funded by the decommissioning trust it should
not be an issue.

Tracy - Do you have a time and agenda set for the Nov. 1 dry run of the
budget presentation?  I may be sitting in for Piro so please keep me
posted as to what the plan is.

Rod - you asked for some detail on our IT capital expenditures.  The
file IT_Teresa includes the requested detail.  Note that in our UE-115
ratecase we were authorized to expend up to $96.8 MM for the  2000-2002
budget years. This is a balancing account, such that if we don't expend
the money we have to refund it to customers.  As an fyi - I've pasted in
below the language from our UE-115 Stipulation on IT costs.


Q.  What is the basis for the stipulation relating to issue S-45, CIS /
IT Disallowance?

A.  After a Staff review of new IT systems and their associated capital
costs, Staff has determined PGE's capital costs for new IT systems to be
prudent.  As a result, the Parties agreed to full recovery of PGE's IT
investments, subject to a Staff audit.  PGE will place into base rates
100% of the 2002 revenue requirement related to the 2000, 2001, and 2002
capital additions for the CIS/IT capital items listed below.  The 2002
revenue requirement included in base rates will be trued-up to the
actual revenue requirement for the CIS/IT capital costs.  OPUC Staff
will audit PGE's actual capital expenditures for the CIS/IT capital
items listed below.

1. Customer information system.
2. Enterprise resources planning (ERP) system.
3. Network meter reading (NMR) backbone and data store (excluding the
meters).
4. Miscellaneous capitalized information technology costs.

Some of the forecasted 2000-2002 capital additions may be delayed until
2003.  Delayed costs can also be recovered, subject to the same Staff
audit procedures and standards.  Only those costs that are reasonable

"RE: Adaytum Status 11-20-01","Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.
 
I'm not real certain of the project organization, but I'll give it a try:
 
The Adaytum implementation is a corporate project managed under the Project Sunrise umbrella.  Joe Darensburg is the lead reporting to Jan Johnson.  Both of these people are originally from corp accounting.  I believe Jan has moved back into the corp accounting group and the overall project is now reporting to Susan Bellinghausen from the ISC.
 
ETS has it's own project which is being led by Tracy Geaccone (ETS Consolidations, which reports to Rod Hayslett).  I believe this was originally set up to address ETS' specific planning/forecasting needs and to dovetail into the corp level implementation.  Hoang Vo is an Adaytum consultant working for Tracy.
 
Lee Baker manages planning and forecasting for the Operations Services Group, which reports to Elaine Concklin and is part of Morris Brassfield's organization.  I believe Elaine has a dotted line to Rod as well.  Lee's team uses Hoang quite a bit as well.
 
I'll call you in a few minutes and we can discuss further.

Cheryl Perchal is going to coordinate a phone conference with you, Teri Galissini and Hoang Vo sometime this week.
We have many questions, not just how actuals could feed into Adaytum for current estimate.
 
You can maybe help me understand how project management is organized for ETS's Adaytum project(s).
1. I understand Teri G is project lead.  Does she report to Rod Hayslett?  Is anyone from Steve Hotte's area involved?
2. Is the project being capitalized or 100% expensed?  No one here has anything like SOW, project authorization, capital project coding for timesheets, status reporting, etc.
 
Thanks, Fred

Fred,
 
I'm out of the office today but took a few minutes to check in and keep the mountain of email from piling too high.  With regard to the actuals item mentioned below, this came to light when my team was doing research on developing cost center reporting out of the finacial data warehouse.  Next Wednesday we have a detailed planning meeting on requirements after which we will be asking the ISC (supports sap, adaytum, data warehouse, etc.)  for an estimate and schedule.  Basically what we are shooting for is plan in the data warehouse to support cost center/variance reporting and actuals in Adaytum to support analysis and development of current estimates and forecasts.  
 
I call you Monday and we can discuss further.  Have a good Thanksgiving.
Greg

Rita's consultant rate is $150.  Hoang's rate is either $150 or $215.  I don't like paying for redesign on a product that should handle large cubes.  I plan to talk with Greg Lewis about this issue.

Subject:        Adaytum Status 11-20-01 


I am out of the office tomorrow and wanted to get some communication out on the Adaytum O&M project. 
I haven't had a chance to talk to Phil on this so this is only my opinion on the project so far.  This will just be a brief rundown. I can expand upon any of the items at your request.

Planned this week: 
Call Hoang Vo on a couple issues.  (See accomplished below) 
Decipher what Rita accomplished in the model and what still needs to be completed. 
Understand the model. 

Accomplished this week: 
Called Hoang Vo on 11-19.  Issues: 
1. Can't open large cubes.  Hoang knows this is a problem.  There is a similar issue with a Houston application which they need to redesign.  

2.  Importing to contributor after allocations ran. Hoang is working on a script.  He will send to us once he has it finished.  Until then we could do it manually but Hoang would have to step us though this process taking away from his time writing the script. Side note: if we can't get the allocations back to contributor, then the users (me right now) can't do much testing besides inputting.

Documentation.  Phil and I have been going through d-lists and d-cubes trying to determine the purpose of each.  Discovered some d-lists and d-cubes that we may not need and documented questions on others.  This written documentation should assist new users of our application.

Cube Renaming - We have renamed the Merit SBP Model to just Merit Model.  This is the only bright spot in the week as renaming cubes seems to be a simple process with the name change occurring in all the appropriate places for links and macros to still work.    


Outstanding Issues: 
Phil and I have come to the conclusion that we need further assistance from Hoang or another consultant familiar with this application.  We are in need of a summary, manager build, and some sort of documented process on how to run this application.  I am not at all comfortable with the application in its present state but feel we can make some progress if we had a complete roadmap of the application and someone to ask questions of.

In a phone conference this afternoon, we were told that getting actuals into the Adaytum O&M application would not be ready for January 2002 close.  ETS thought that the whole actuals process was being addressed under the Project Sunrise umbrella which is not the case.  Now ETS must champion this effort. It is being headed up by Greg Lewis but there is not an estimated completion date.

I would like to have a meeting on October 31st (maybe later if that date won't work), either in the AM or the PM, but probably about 3 hours or so.    I would like to discuss organizations and how we are going to provide the support the EGS organization requires both at Stan's level and at each level in the organization.    I would also like to discuss the top 3-5 concerns you have for your business and your people.   You should decide if there are people in your organization that are needed to discuss basic functions of Planning, Accounting, Finance and Tax and feel free to include them in this process, but I would like to keep the group to Director level or above.    Please let Kathy know who they are.    I would like to know if you are available or have a preference for morning or afternoon.

Thanks.

So, I can't tell what my exposure is here.  Which line do I use?

The maximum shown on the schedule is $1.1MM   (expand column width on Column A).   Although it looks from the spreadsheet as if $300 to $600K may be more realistic for the compressor fuel tax through 4/01.  However, there could be $11K/month going forward. 

The other issue would be the sales tax on our purchase of personal property from NWP.  Whatever that may turn out to be, it should not be an earnings concern, but would be capitalized as part of the plant.  

If you need more specificity, I suggest you give Dan a call.

I'm sure Jerry is aware of this.  He isn't Dan's boss, but they're in the same CC and only a couple of cubes away in the Jefferson bldg.   
I don't think we have any reserves/accruals for these on the TW balance sheet.

John, I have prepared a more formal position regarding the exemption of ""Compressor Fuel"" consumed in a ""continuing business activity"" (Gas services).  Before I submit this position to you, I will circulate my position letter within the company and validate the facts.  
I will be relying primarily on Colorado Regulations 26-102.21 or 39-26-104.1(d.1).  Have these regulations changed recently?  My service may be out of date.
Attached below are schedules for Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption for the audit period.

Dan,
Here is my initial response.  I haven't had time to do too much research on
this, but this preliminarily the Department's position.  Sorry this took so
long  but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority.  jp

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing

might agree.  But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.

I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.
Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service
to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need
more research on this.

The disposition of penalty and interest will be resolved at a level above the auditor level.

Attached is the revised 4th Qtr Forecast Summary.

Also, attached is the expense analysis I did.  Please note, I did not include UAF.

I have compared our actual numbers with James' spreadsheet and Steve Kleb's earnings model.  Once I made that adjustment for the $244 reserve in August on James' spreadsheet, we are all in agreement that the YTD actuals for TW commercial is $162.7.  I have also verified that number with Robert Miller and he agrees that is the number reflected on the Income Statement.

The $244 reserve reversal was made in September and reflected in the transport margins revenues.

I was reviewing the Plan Calendar after I heard about Phil's Director's conference.  Tracy has a 2002 Plan Review with Stan scheduled for October 10th, which conflicts with Phil's Directors Conference scheduled for October 9th through 11th.  Tracy has her calendar of Reviews with Stan on the intranet for the rest of the year.  You may want to be sure they are on Phil's Calendar.  Below is a link to Tracy's ETS Planning Calendar of due dates and reviews.

Tracy, is Stan's review still set for the 10th?  If it is a firm date, do you think there will be further discussions regarding Operations by that time since we are reviewing O&M and Capital on September 5th.

Please find attached file. Transportation & Storage Revenue is right off the Earning Model Income Statement. Carlton data can be found in the Commercial Function detail within the ""Database"" worksheet of the Earning Model. The Cash Flow verbiage is very general related to the subject matter, but does provide a business reason on a Direct Cash Flow basis for an item buried within the Indirect Cash Flow format. Call me if you have any further questions.

Hi Tracy, 

Please see attached for the Plan that Stan Horton will be looking at tomorrow 
morning. This version includes Intercompany interest expense that was not 
previously budgeted. It also has a more detail break-out of capital 
expenditures. 

For the O&M detail pages, we will not be able to give you the same break-out 
for our cost as you have requested. Our GL is build on FERC accounts and is 
not condusive to SAP type sorting. 

Also, note that all O&M are at this point still straight lined for the year. 
The quarterly shaping of earnings will not be available until mid to late 
November. There will be significant swing between quarters from these results 
to the final one. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you!  These meetings are very helpful in better understanding the business.  I'm currently scheduled to be in Korea, but may change plans and will let you know.  

By the way, Rod had suggested that I hold off on bothering you about my group's budget until after you complete this enormous endeavor.  However, FYI, I had submitted an approximately $2 million budget through Steve Kean's group and about $300,000 was submitted for Gina Taylor's group in the ETS budget.  I'm probably going to identify some reductions in these numbers.  Please let me know when you need details.

Sorry to bother you with this one again -

in 1999 and 2000, what were the revenues and costs associated with the base gas sales - the footnote disclosure indicates $53 million and $34 million in sales but not the cost.  In addition, going forward, how much of the 2001 and 2002 TG&S expense is solely related to this transaction (i.e. expenses that would not be incurred but for this transaction)? My question may be a bit confusing - call me if I am totally off base!

"RE: 2002 Plan Lay Presentation Run Through","Tracy,

I'm sure you have no time for this now, but I wanted to get this information to you as soon as I had it.  I am very concerned to learn that only a part (approximately 1/3 or $680,000) was allocated out to EGS units as part of Steve Kean's budget.  (A disproportionately high $600,000 was allocated to EGM and the remaining $738,000 was retained at corp.)  It is my understanding that $470,000 was budgeted for the ETS communications group.  

Recognizing that my proposed corp. budget already reflected a decrease of approximately $ 1 million from the 2001 budget and $5 million from its 2000 budgets, it will be tight, but we could do our work as an EGS group if we were able to get the EGS allocations ($680,000), ETS communications budget ($470,000) and the portion that was unallocated corp. ($738,000), for a total of $1,888,000.  

I presume the problem with this is that it includes $738,000, which was not allocated to EGS entities.  Do you think this can be accommodated or should we look at keeping the budget at corp., with a reporting line to Stan?  (I have not broached this with Stan.)  I've attached spreadsheets with my corp. budget and Gina Taylor's ETS budget.  When you have time, I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this with you.

Thanks,

John

"FW: Beatrice Trailblazer PAF Comparison (Gray County)","
Here is the attached spreadsheet showing the variances of the Revised PAF compared to the Original PAF for the Beatrice Trailblazer to C Line (C.014625).  As we discussed, it appears likely that there will be savings from other parts of the total project (on the TW side) that can be used to cover the increased costs.  I propose we revise this particular PAF number to cover the additional costs and decrease the TW PAF by a like cost.  The total project economics remain unchanged. 

(Rod based on this solution, I don't think it needs to be discussed at Stan's meeting Monday).

fields (adjacent to West U Elementary School).  This week we will 
have one practice only.  Starting next week (Aug 20) there will be a 
Monday practice with the West U trainers at 5:30 (same fields).  This 
trainer practice is optional - however we found that the kids really 
get a lot out of these trainer practices and they are probably better 
for ball skills than what we will do in coaches practice.  We will 
discuss other issues on Wed.

I'm looking forward to a fun season.

Thanks.

David Rowley

ps.  We are on Field South #5 for the Wed practices.

"RE: NNG/Utilcorp $100,000 a month Reserve","
The payment is a non-discretionary obligation for NNG.  I am only suggesting we change the timing of the payment.  In terms of the 2001 3rd Current Estimate, there would be an upside.

I'm not sure why we can't afford it since we have been talking about a much larger base gas purchase transaction.  Has the cash/earnings outlook changed?

Biggest problem is I can't afford to pay out the $1.2 mm.    Need to avoid, unless someone can show me a good cash return on the incremental investment of $.5 MM.

Subject:	RE: NNG/Utilcorp $100,000 a month Reserve

I have looked at the Utilicorp reserve, spoken with the Marketing account manager and would like to propose the following:  

Facts:
?	As of August 2001, there is $1.0 million in the reserve account.  
?	The contractual obligation to pay UCU $1.2 million for 2001 can be offset by a $.7million ""credit"" for value given to UCU by NNG Marketing during the year. Thus the amount to be paid to UCU in October would be $.5 million.  
?	The Third Current Estimate now assumes a $.6 million payment..  Reserves are not needed to meet Third Current Estimate.
?	UCU has expressed an interest in banking the $.7million credit from 2001 to 2002 

Recommendation:
?	Defer $.7 million 2001 credit to 2002 - (negotiate time value appropriately)
?	Pay $1.2 million in October 2001(4th quarter)
?	Reverse $1.0 reserve in September (3rd quarter), as it is not longer needed to meet Third Current Estimate.
?	Upside from 3rd Current Estimate 2001 is $.4million. (for the year).
?	No further reserve entries are necessary going forward.


$ Millions	Third CE  2001	Proposal 2001	Plan 2002	Proposal 2002	
Payment	     -1.2	   -1.2	   -1.2	     -1.2	
Credit	        .6	       0	     .6	       -.7	
Sub Total 	      -.6	   -1.2	    -.6	          0	
Reserve Reversal	.	    1.0	      0	          	
Net 	      .-.6	   -.2	   -.6	         -.5	

				

Results:
?	$1.0 million upside to Third Current Estimate for the month of September.
?	-$.6 million downside to Third Current Estimate for the month of October. 
?	$.4 million upside to Third Current Estimate for the year.
?	Shift $.7 million value from 2001 to 2002 for a $.1 upside in 2002.

Recently, Enron Corp received a request from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide information relating to any spill, discharge, or release of ""oil"" (broadly defined but excludes natural gas or liquid petroleum gas) from any EOTT pipeline facility for the time period from July 1, 1998 to July 7, 2001. A ""pipeline facility"" includes those fleet operations where tanks are connected by/to pipelines or to other tanks through piping and in which any EOTT entity owns an interest. The EPA request seeks detailed information concerning releases of ""oil"" during this period, including among other things, the extent and nature of the spill, which EOTT or EPSC representative/employee was the first to learn of the spill, remedial efforts, weather conditions at the release site, etc. The request also seeks information concerning pipeline management system(s) in place during this three-year period and efforts or investments made by EOTT to prevent the release of ""oil,"" including capital costs, expenditures and maintenance costs. 

In order to respond to the EPA information request, you are instructed to identify and locate any relevant documents or information and ensure that no responsive information or documents are destroyed or discarded. You may be contacted about this inquiry in the near future, because we will be sending teams to many of the field locations to assist employees in identifying and locating documents responsive to the EPA's information request. If you believe you have relevant information or responsive documents but have not been contacted/visited by one of our teams by August 17, 2001, please contact the designated document custodian, Don Hawkins (713-646-7358).

Due to the length of the EPA information request, we have not attached the document here.

Subject:	RE: Benefits Costs

You know, I am just too busy to deal with the tone of your messages right now.   Give me a contact at AA and as soon as I finish my budget and pricing projects I will call them directly.    

Before I can do anything, I need the Enron company number for EGP fuels. I do know that our actuary has never broken out the expense or PBO for this company.  Until I know what the company number is we won't know which ETS group it was consolidated within.  Probably the Services Group, but maybe Corp.  Once we know that then either the ETS accounting or corp. accounting can look into the actual intercompany allocations if any.  Tracy, can you do me a favor and look into how you all do the accounting for this company and I'll try to give you a call later this week.   (Tracy, I may be able to locate the 2000 and possibly the 2001 allocation sheets but I am  not comfortable that we will still have the budget information for 1998 and 1999.  In addition, the true-ups definately do not go to this level.)

Arthur Anderson is in the process of completing the preparation of audited financials for EGP Fuels Company.  Included with these financials are footnote 
	disclosures.  Please provide the following information to be included with these financials.

	1)  Total charges from Enron Corp for EGP Fuels employee benefit plans for 1998, 1999, and 2000.  (I would think that the books of EGP should show the actual charges.  Our reserve records only provide a total distribution allocation.  This will have to come from accounting.)

	2)  EGP Fuels' Enron Retirement Plan pension costs for 1998, 1999, and 2000.  (As stated, this is not prepared at the EGP level.  The best we can do here is to work with the actuary to do an estimate of the costs but this will likely require a historical pull of information which you may or may not have available. I'll need to speak with AA&CO directly to determine best course of action.)

	3)  EGP Fuels' Accumulated Postretirement Benefit Obligation (APBO) for benefit plans other than pensions net periodic postretirement benefit costs for 1998,
	     1999, and 2000.  (Same as above.)

	Cynthia,

	Please note that Sandy and I did talk but I was left with the expectation that I would still receive some type of response, even if that response was merely that 
	the information is not available.   Also, it was suggested that I try contacting You, Mikie and Sandy for this information but I did not receive a response from 
	any of you without additional proding.  And, those responses left me believing that I would hear more from you, which I did not.  Lastly, I did mention that if
	necessary we could look at using Financial Accounting for this information but this is not desirable since this method will result in fragmented and less 
	accurate information.  Also, Arthur Andersen has indicated that this is not the preferred method of providing this information.  

	Based on the email which follows below I will assume that Financial Accounting is my only recourse and that You will assist in convincing Arthur Andersen
	that this is the only alternative available to meet their timing requirements.

I can not do this until my budgets and medical pricing are complete.  If you need it immediately, then you will need to do what Sandy talked with you about last week and that is to get with Financial Accounting.  There is no way I can look at this until later this week.

	Cindy,

	Arthur Andersen has requested benefits information necessary to complete audited financials that are required to complete Project Timber (the sale
	of the MTBE assets to EOTT).  The following requests have not been acknowledged and remain unanswered.  Please let me know who I should contact
	for this information. 

	Arthur Andersen has since also requested this information for the 6 months ending June 30, 2000 and June 30, 2001.  Any guidance you can provide is
	greatly appreciated.

	Thanks,
		Tom    X54899

"ETS Year-end Performance Evaluation Process","
The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.  Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.  This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.

(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)

Feedback and Evaluation
Employees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.

?	PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7
?	Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14
?	Written evaluations due to HR			January 15

Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.

Compensation
Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.  Division Head approval is required.

As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.

Relative Talent Reviews
Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.  The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.  Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.  Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.  Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.  EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.  Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.

If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative.

Attached is a file showing depreciation for NNG Commercial after excluding depreciation for the capital dollars associated with rate case settlement (lines 13-16).  The 2002 depreciation is calculated to be $4.379 million.  

I think philosophically it s a good idea to track capital projects within NNG Commercial based on the life of the contracts used to justify the project.  I don't think Neubauer is quite there yet.  

My concern is that we have developed an IBIT  target for 2002 by using a 2001 number that does not include depreciation.  It seems that we ought to offset the 01 starting point by the amount of the 02 depreciation.  Lets talk further with Rod.

All are necessary upgrades if not done this year will have to be done next year.  Not one of these upgrades projects is over $900k but together it totals $2.7.  We also are continuing to do upgrades in the Houston offices - all budgeted items and if not upgraded this year will have to be done next year.

Design:  $350,000
Churn: $250,000
Furniture:  $1,150,000
Contingency: $250,000

"Project Update","Hello Tracy,

I wanted to share some conversations that I've had with both Demetrics and
Hoang this week related to the project.

On of the biggest issue seems to be with resources.  I know that you guys
have been quite busy with your planning process but it has been very
difficult to get the required information or time from the resources that
are committed to the project.  This is due to the fact that they currently
have a heavy workload and cannot dedicate the time necessary for the
project.  It is having an impact on the timeline.  The home office model
could be a lot further along if some of the required information was
delivered as requested.  Also, I am also getting a sense that there is a
lack of ownership with regards to the Adaytum application.  It is important
that the users have a comfort level with the application otherwise it will
become very difficult to transition it when the project is over.

We need to think about who will administer the system once it is in full
production.  This individual should be identified and running the
administration duties as soon as possible.  My fear is that without proper
ownership of the application and a dedicated administrator (at least in the
short run), it will be very difficult to transition the roles.

We've had some technical issues with the production and development
environment.  Although these issues have been resolved, it has had an impact
on the timeline.

There are times that the definition for the model is not clearly articulated
and it has resulted in the redesign of the model.  Much time has been spent
on gathering business process information from various people which has
caused a delay in the model development.

I hope that we can constructively talk through these issues tomorrow and
produce solutions that will rectify the situation, mitigate the risks, and
result in a successful implementation.


Our call is scheduled for 1:30 tomorrow but I can be available earlier if
you would like to discuss this.

"Fundraising Efforts","It's that time of year when all the school functions set out to raise funds for all their needs, and all of us are inundated with school fundraisers.  Thank Goodness, this is my last year of fundraising efforts for my children!!

My daughter, Michelle, is a High School Senior this year and is a 4th year member of the Stratford High School Spartanaires (Drill Team).  She has some pretty tall goals to achieve, and we both would really appreciate any business you can give us!

We have a very large selection of personalized (or not) Christmas and Holiday Cards for both personal and business use.  Your order will be shipped directly to you from the company.

We also have a great selection of personalized stationary (great for Holiday Gifts!).  These are also shipped directly to you or any address you choose.

In addition, we have a selection of Holiday gift ideas including wrapping paper, bows, candles, picture frames, Holiday Tins with cookies, candy, etc. and a variety of other Holiday fare.  I will deliver the items in this catalog to you at work.

We will be fundraising from now through October 29.  Michelle will be turning orders in each week on Tuesday morning, so order early to get your items early.  Michelle has to turn in her last order on Tuesday morning, October 30th.  The cards and stationary are generally received within two weeks of your order.

Please see Maria Perales (x31437) if you would like to look at the samples and you cannot reach me.  I have left the Big Holiday Card Sample Book with her, but have taken the other catalogs with me out of town for a few days.  I'll be back in the office on Thursday, Aug. 23rd with these catalogs.

Thanks to everyone for your support!  These products are very high quality, and you won't be disappointed!  Please forward this to anyone you know who may be interested in ordering and Thanks Again!

"FW: Standby / Cooper Pre-Buy","Tracy,  We will be increasing NNG Operations Capital Current Estimate by $4.0MM with the forecast coming up to cover the additional Cooper Pre-Buy Standby.  Morris indicated that there was a pot of Capital dollars somewhere in ETS that can be reduced so that we don't increase the total ETS Capital Budget.  Can you confirm this?

Thanks,  Elaine

I spoke with Morris, and we will increase NNG Operations for the $4.0MM and request that it be offset elsewhere within ETS.  I believe that Rod may have a pot at the ETS level.  We will need to work with Tracy on this.

If you have dollars that you will not spend, though, please let us know.

$1,957,583 has hit the Blanket Standby WBS for the Cooper pre-buy inventory.  According to John Reese, another $2,010,921 will hit this year.  How are these dollars to be funded?  I am assuming that we will be adjusting our CE for the Cooper Pre-Buy dollars, but I would like confirmation on how you would like for us to handle.

If you could let us know ASAP it would be appreciated.

Subject:	FW: Agenda for TW Meeting:  PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL, ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Stan, Rod and Danny:  following is an outline of the issues I'd like to cover tomorrow.  The last point is the most important, so we can blow through the preliminaries as fast (or slow) as is appropriate.  

 
1.  Current Status of Proceeding
	--Briefing is complete
	--minor skirmishing on page limit and Staff motion to strike still going on (argument set for 9-28) 
 	--ALJ decision still expected on or around 10-15

2.  Primary Issues
	--TW's tariff and posting procedures are confusing, complex, inconsistent, and allow TW too much discretion
	--TW gave Sempra and Richardson unfair advance notice of the capacity availability (preposting conversations) 
	--TW withheld operational capacity and agreed to make it available only to shippers who agreed to favorable deals with TW
	--TW offered negotiated terms and conditions in exchange for the shippers' agreement to pay high rates  
	--The Sempra and Richardson deals are irrational and must have been the product of market power or unfairness

3.  The Political Climate
	--FERC is now coming after PG&E GT NW, on facts that look worse than ours (customers claim they weren't offered the recourse rate).   That case is set for hearing with a decision within 120 days.  Staff raised one new issue:  misuse of alternate delivery point rights.   
	--Prices continue to abate, with some in California declaring the energy crisis over  

4. Likely Litigation Outcome
	--Little or no chance of a complete win
	--No party proposed refunds or unwinding of the deals as a remedy, but ALJ could recommend it
	--No party proposed elimination of TW's negotiated rate authority, but ALJ could recommend it
	--Some additional changes in tariff and posting procedures almost certain   
	--ALJ likely to defer difficult decisions on refunds and negotiated rate policy to the Commission 

5.  Settlement Recommendation
	--Staff has initiated discussions; ball is in our court to make a specific proposal
	--Recommend proposal to Staff that includes some or all of the following points:
		*limited moratorium for next heating season on additional index-index contracts on operational capacity	
		*future operational capacity sales all done through interactive open season
		*new posting and capacity allocation procedures in the tariff, with most discretion eliminated 	
		*TW makes many of the tariff and posting changes advocated by Indicated Shippers (i.e., pro rata allocation) 
		*TW offers to upgrade the EBB to a ""fully interactive, next generation EBB"" as soon as operationally feasible 
	--TW and Staff will try to get all interested parties on board after general framework nailed down.

Subject:	2002 Plan Dates & Information

Attached is the revised calendar for the completion of the 2002 Plan.  As you will note, the dates have been moved up approximately 2 weeks in most cases.  This is a result of the recent management changes and executive availability.

A couple of notes on the dates:

-Please note that dates for assessments apply to ALL BUSINESS UNITS who will be senders of costs.
-The October 18th due date for the Presentation Pages: I will provide more information at a later date on this.
-The dates highlighted in yellow are not 2002 Plan related, but merely a reminder of other significant items that will be occurring in this time frame.

Also included in the file FYI is the PROPOSED schedule for the Plan/Executive Business Reviews with the Office of the Chairman.  These are still subject to change.  Rick Causey's office (Sharron Westbrook) is coordinating the schedules of the applicable attendees.  I will let you know when these are final.

Additionally, the Plan will be submitted to Corporate in the traditional format, Excel files.  We will be sending the templates out on (or by) September 20, as reflected in the revised calendar.  However, our strategy is still to enter 2002 with the full plan ( I/S, B/S, Cash Flow) loaded into Adaytum and to utilize Adaytum going forward from that point.  Therefore, we will be enhancing the Excel files to include the level of detail that will be loaded into Adaytum, so there will be additional lines and/or supplemental schedules added to the files.

One more thing - please communicate all of this information to the appropriate individuals in your business unit/group.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,
Steve

"Daily Update","
Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

I just wanted to close the loop on the question of deferring the $.7million UCU credit to 2002.  The last we talked, it was decided that we could not defer the credit because of cash target concerns.  If this is still the directive, we will see a positive variance to Third Current Estimate in October of $1.2 million.  

Would you confirm that this is still our decision?  If so, we will include the earnings upside  in our Quarter Forecast next week.

Thanks

From: 	ETS General Announcement/ET&S/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-ETS+20General+20Announcement_ET+26S_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Stan Horton, Chairman & CEO@ENRON

Subject:	United Way 2001 - Team ETS

  
This year's Enron United Way Campaign kicked off last week with Leadership Giving.  The company-wide campaign along with Week of Caring kicks off on August 6.  ETS' Day of Caring is on August 9 at the Harboch Ripley Center in southeast Houston.  Please contact Kimberly Nelson to volunteer for a morning or afternoon shift at ETS' Day of Caring.  
 
To celebrate a successful Campaign and Week of Caring, an employee appreciation lunch will be held on Friday, August 10, at 11:00 am at Antioch Park across the street from the Enron building.  In correlation with this year's United Way campaign theme, ""Building Houston's Future,"" and in the true spirit of Enron, there will be a building competition among the business units at the lunch.  
 
Each business unit will form a team and build something with building blocks at the August 10 appreciation event.  
 
Rod Hayslett, Phil Lowry and I will lead Team ETS.  To form the rest of Team ETS, we thought it would be fun to have a little contest.  
 
Here's the contest:  Correctly answer all of the questions in the link below by Wednesday, August 1, at 5pm, and your name will be entered into a drawing.  NO late entries will be accepted.
 
We'll draw 7 names from the entries received and if your name is drawn, you will be an official member of Team ETS and help build the most incredible structure imaginable with me, Rod and Phil.  We'll announce the lucky winners on Thursday, August 2.  
 
At the August 10 celebration, all of the business unit building block structures will be built and judged based on Enron's attributes - smart, innovative, bold, ambitious, and united.  Ken Lay will host the Applause Meter and the business unit with the greatest amount of applause will win.  We need all of our ETS employees outside cheering on Team ETS.  Free lunch is included in the deal as well.
 
Let's have some fun with this!  With your help, Enron and United Way will be successful at Building Houston's Future.  
 
Good Luck!
 
Stan

"FW: R Cost Centers","I have not heard back on if you have corrected your reports.  Again I want to clarify that I am not using gross/net reports to prove to you that R112386 has a balance of only $64,720.92, I am using SAP cost center reports.  The only difference between the gross/ret report and the R cost centers is a $196.48 direct charge for computer expense to a FAR order.  This difference is detailed in the spreadsheet I have provided.  Are you still sure my R cost centers are over budget by $26,000?  They sure look under-budget by $23,000 to me.

 Sorry we could not meet.  The problem seems to be Mary lists the total in R 112386 as $114,109.41 while in SAP the total is $64,720.92.  Please see attached.  I don't see how Mary's report could possibly tie to SAP.  Please provide me an SAP report that details $114,109.41 in R112386 because the one I run keeps coming up with $64,720.92.

"RE: Transwestern pipeline Colorado Audit FEIN 74-1294795 (Account	 L80-30571) To April 2001","Tracy, I talked to the Colorado Sales and Use Tax auditor today.  The auditor will submit two assessments:  Assets and Compressor Fuel.  

Compressor fuel will be assessed, but I believe the following are plausible arguments that might succeed and favorably adjust the estimated $350,000 liability (Plus Penalty & Interest):

	(2)(b)(ii)  ""Purchase Price"" should be adjusted to reflect TWP as a market maker, that could purchase natural gas 			lower than market could supply and transportation in San Juan Index
			(Price should be $1.80 / MMBTU down from Avg $1.90/ MMBTU)
	   (b)(iii)	The correct tax rate would be 3%, not 5%, local tax should not be applicable.  Formal research is required.


Assuming $1.80/MMBTU, the original estimate ($350k) might be adjusted down to $231,218.46, or as low as $138,731.08, as follows:

				 2,569,094 	Consumption  MMBTU
			   $		1.80 	Price / MMBTU
			   $4,624,369.20 	Purchase 
				$92,487.38 	Local Tax
			     $138,731.08 	State Tax
			     $231,218.46 	Total Tax

Please call if you would like to meet and discuss this issue.

(Account L80-30571) 



Tracy, I called the auditor last week, following our conversation.  The auditor has not returned my call.  Field work is complete and no formal assessment has been issued.  I have unresolved issues which the auditor must consider before issuing the assessment. In Summarizing our conversation last week:

1)  I have not seen a preliminary assessment, which I hoped would be coming in October.
2)  During the auditor's field audit, the auditor proposed to assess tax on the following issues:
    a)  Assets Purchase $500,000 in Tax, Penalty & Interest.  I might protest almost all assessed 
	  amounts for this category.
    b)  Expenses (Compressor Fuel) Estimate $350,000 for audit Period.  Issues not resolved:
	  i)    My position is that no tax is due, except for domestic fuel consumption.
	  ii)   If ""Compressor Fuel"" is taxable, what is the ""Purchase Price"".
	  iii)  Is the 2% local tax applicable to ""Compressor Fuel""?
	  iv)   Should tax be calculated prospectively, rather than retroactively?
	  v)    If assessed, Transwestern requests that the current regulation be revised to 
		  reflect a change for this issue (Tariff may accommodate a pass through without
		  a rate case?).

I will provide a copy of the assessment for your records and subsequent consideration, when available.  The auditor was promoted during my audit and is transition.  Considering this transition and my challenges, response time is unpredictable.

Could you please give the Transwestern Business Unit Coordinator some advice on when this audit will be resolved and what you think the best estimate is on the amount of compressor fuel tax  (PPI) that have to expense.

So, I can't tell what my exposure is here.  Which line do I use?
The maximum shown on the schedule is $1.1MM   (expand column width on Column A).   Although it looks from the spreadsheet as if $300 to $600K may be more realistic for the compressor fuel tax through 4/01.  However, there could be $11K/month going forward. 
The other issue would be the sales tax on our purchase of personal property from NWP.  Whatever that may turn out to be, it should not be an earnings concern, but would be capitalized as part of the plant.  
If you need more specificity, I suggest you give Dan a call.

I'm sure Jerry is aware of this.  He isn't Dan's boss, but they're in the same CC and only a couple of cubes away in the Jefferson bldg.   
I don't think we have any reserves/accruals for these on the TW balance sheet.

John, I have prepared a more formal position regarding the exemption of ""Compressor Fuel"" consumed in a ""continuing business activity"" (Gas services).  Before I submit this position to you, I will circulate my position letter within the company and validate the facts.  
I will be relying primarily on Colorado Regulations 26-102.21 or 39-26-104.1(d.1).  Have these regulations changed recently?  My service may be out of date.
Attached below are schedules for Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption for the audit period.

Dan,
Here is my initial response.  I haven't had time to do too much research on
this, but this preliminarily the Department's position.  Sorry this took so
long  but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority.  jp

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing
accompanying the transfer of cash from Enron to Northwest Pipeline Corp., I
might agree.  But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.

I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.
Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service
to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need
more research on this.

The disposition of penalty and interest will be resolved at a level above the auditor level.

"Reminder - Preliminary Allocations","As stated on the revised 2002 Plan Key Dates calendar, Friday, September 7 was the day preliminary allocations were due to any business unit which will be recieving allocations from your business unit.  If you have not yet communicated the amounts with the BUs who will be a receiver of costs from your BU, this is a freindly suggestion that you may want to at least touch base with the receiver BUs.  Since targets are to scheduled to be communicated this week and some groups have already begun to build their Plan, it is important that some additional unexpected allocated costs aren't a surprise at the last minute.  Some business units may interpret not hearing anything from another business unit as no allocations are forthcoming.  This week is important to the overall planning process, since questions and clarifications regarding allocations should be taking place this in order to facilitate the allocations being finalized by the 14th (the end of this week). 
Thanks,
Steve


PS - If you have already sent your allocations out, please disregard.

"RE: Forecast for MGT","Let me give you my thoughts.
We acquired MGT on April 30.  If you include O&M expenses prior to that period of time you will be including all of the MGT salaries, allocations and overheads for which we had no responsibility.
El Paso, through the transition services agreement, is performing the accounting functions for MGT.  Each month someone in my department provides to them actual expenses paid through Enron that need to be recorded as O&M on MGT.  These are additive to those expenses processed through the El Paso system.  
I believe you should be picking up actuals from May 1 forward.

At Third Current Estimate, we added a full year forecast for MGT for Operations and added the MGT and Border amounts together on the Border page in the ETS Functional Income Statement as instructed.

We are trying to confirm what we should be reflecting.  Jason is being instructed that ETS should not pick up any actuals for January through May, and that we should use Actuals received from El Paso for June forward, and not our numbers.  The El Paso amounts for June through September are close to what we have, but not exact.

Please advise us as to what we should be reflecting and we will revise our schedules.  We did not pick up MGT at all until 3rd CE, so I'm OK with restating 3rd CE to reflect the appropriate amounts for MGT and rolling forward from there.

We can go over Lay review ideas again then.  The agenda for November 1 has you at 4:30 Houston time.  Will that work for you?  If not, are you comfortable with Tod doing it.

Sorry Tracy, I can't come up with the reason behind the July change of $11 
million in ""Other, Net"". Carolyn who completes the schedules had surgery 
yesterday so will be out until Sept. 11. I can't find the source of the 
amount that is hardcoded in the spreadsheet - she must have combined 
something. One thought was TOLI, but it was flat in July. I have two other 
people who might be able to help me on vacation this week as well. 

>>> Geaccone, Tracy 08/30/01 04:24PM >>> 
There was a big change in the Funds Flow number you submitted for the 3Q in 
August from the 3Q you submitted last month. Can you tell me what the change 
is due to?

I think I have this covered.    The issue is with Corp. planning and their requests, not the other Corp groups and Tracy and I have taken care of that.    Jeff didn't take it the way Jim has, in fact he welcomed the idea.    Jeff has told me that dealing with Jim might be an ""experience"".    Maybe you should ask Jim to raise the issue with me, or alternatively just let him know that you would like to be aware of the numbers before they go to Corp, which is all Tracy asked for.     Do you see ""the tone of the message is demeaning"" in Tracy's message?    Just curious.

I would like to discuss the below message when you have a chance.  There has been a lot of distrust and concern over ""managed information"" with respect to the international assets.  My team has overcome this by going out of our way to cooperate and be transparent with corp the last year and a half.  I am uncomfortable asking my people not to respond to corp requests for information.  I also think the tone of the message is demeaning and could have a morale impact on my folks.

Mark, 

In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2nd CE.  It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferred out of EGAS since the 2nd CE  ( Azurix International and South America Merchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East.   This does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe to EGAS in the 4th Qtr.   We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will send you those numbers when we are done.

AFUDC equity (SAP accounts 59900900-AFUDC equity settlement and 69010000-AFUDC equity) map to Hyperion 1755-interest capitalized.  The only companies using these two SAP accounts as of July and the YTD credit balances in each of them are companies 141-$531,155, 179-$328,270, 413-$12,681 (debit), 536-$3,066,408, 60-$91,391 and 62-$290,438.

In conclusion I have reviewed the proposed remapping with representatives of the various ETS companies and they confirmed the remapping would not present any problems to them.

PS.   Pls notify me or Hoyt Ivey when change is made in Corp Hyperion so he can remap same accounts in EOC hyperion.

Subject: Western Energy--Power and Gas Prices and Volatility Expected to
Fall - CERA Monthly Briefing 



Title: Demand, Prices to Follow Trajectory of the Economy 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2702;


***********************************************************************

WESTERN ENERGY--POWER AND GAS PRICES AND VOLATILITY EXPECTED TO FALL

CERA expects a weaker US economy to be one of the outcomes of the tragic events 
on September 11, 2001, which will further reduce the demand for gas and power. 
Spot prices for natural gas and power already reflect this expectation, and 
CERA's outlook anticipates continued price weakness. 

*  As new supplies continue to arrive over the next year, even as demand 
weakens, the West will have more than adequate supplies of gas and power.
 
*  This surplus supply situation will put additional downward pressure on 
prices.

*  The shift from supply tightness to the recent plunge in prices can be traced 
principally to the rapid decline in demand for both gas and power this year, 
while supplies grew.

The consensus is now for an am meeting.     I will have Kathy Campos, my assistant, begin to set things up.    For those out of town, you can consider attending via the telephone and if Kathy can get it set up, we will have a video conference call as well.

Subject:	How are we doing and what are my issues meeting?
Importance:	High

I would like to have a meeting on October 31st (maybe later if that date won't work), either in the AM or the PM, but probably about 3 hours or so.    I would like to discuss organizations and how we are going to provide the support the EGS organization requires both at Stan's level and at each level in the organization.    I would also like to discuss the top 3-5 concerns you have for your business and your people.   You should decide if there are people in your organization that are needed to discuss basic functions of Planning, Accounting, Finance and Tax and feel free to include them in this process, but I would like to keep the group to Director level or above.    Please let Kathy know who they are.    I would like to know if you are available or have a preference for morning or afternoon.

Thanks.

"VP/Above -  2002 Budget","Tracy

For VP level & above, I had the team pull by individual a recap of payroll information from SAP.  This extract shows all the ""current""  payroll buckets that contain some type of reportable compensation.  We then took that information & broke it into ""fixed "" and ""variable"" pay components.  The attached spreadsheet provides you an individual/job group summary for the ""fixed"" vs. ""variable"" pay components on a consolidated basis.   The ""variable"" pay amounts include ad-hoc payments for options, annual/retention bonus payments, tax settlements/refunds, etc.  Based on our conversation, my sense is that for budgeting purposes, you will need to utilize the ""fixed"" total amounts.

PLEASE NOTE - while the ""fixed"" pay components have been annualized, the ""variable"" pay components represent only those amounts recorded in the payroll system to date.  Also, I understand there may be changes to the flex dollar amounts - but I do not yet know the details.  I've checked with Executive Compensation to determine whether there might be a change in the Flexperq amounts - am still waiting for input.  I will advise you of any changes I hear with regard to these elements. 

Additionally, on the fixed side, you should also budget some merit dollars - I would suggest 4-5%.  We do not know the amount yet - but I think that should be consistent with past practice.


Tracy - if you need anything else, please let me know.

Subject:	RE: 2002 Aviation budget

Use $4,800 so there will be no surprises. That includes fixed and variable. 
The budget has not been approved yet, there could be an increase, but I feel confident with the $4,800 estimate.

Caroline,  What I been told is the following:

	$3,775/hr  fixed costs plus variable costs associated with specific trips i.e. fuel, landing fees, catering etc.

Typically I think an average per hour cost of $4,500 is used.

Gary,  Does this sound reasonable for budgeting purposes?

For the 2002 Plan NNG will budget aviation by function i.e commercial, operations etc.  Therefore each functional area needs to assess their company plane usage and budget accordingly for 2002.

Gary,  Once we have rolled each functional area up to the NNG legal entity level we will be able to provide you with the total NNG aviation budget for 2002.
