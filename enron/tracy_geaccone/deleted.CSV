"Enron Kids Adopt A Child Program","


 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to ""sponsor"" every child in that school.  What we mean by ""sponsor"" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to ""sponsor"" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!

"2002 Plan Assessments as of 10/19/01 for EREC","Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures.  

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments (""8xxxxxxx"" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses (""52502000"" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Actually we are not going to wear any of these in FA&A.     They will be carried at the legal entity level, even though we may put them in the model as FA&A.   There are just some issues that won't go away.    I will still need the calculations of the depreciation and such so that we can determine who is responsible, when we do the legal entity stuff, so we may as well add everything the way we were planning to do it and we will format it to where we want to show it in the final.

The latest from a discussion with Rod, Mary Kay and Dave N. this morning:


FA&A will carry the depreciation - targets may be adjusted for yr to yr increase

IMP and FAS 106 will  be carried at FA&A ,Potential offsets to yr to yr increases are yet to be  determined.


Thus, the above items will not be put into the NNG Commercial Adaytum model.

I'm getting back to something, I left  you a message last week.  When Barney presented the ETS budget for the pipeline operations, he included amounts allocated from ETS for IT ($170k) and Accounting ($59k).  You left me a phone mail  message regarding the IT charge and suggested that I contact Caroline Barnes (which I did today).  Both of these appear to be new charges for 2002 and we'd like to get information on what they relate to.  Can you shed some light on the Accounting charge?

"RE: PGE 2002 Capital Costs and IT Detail","Jessica,

I have not finalized the PGH II/Other capital budgets, but they will conform to the disclosure schedule.
Let me know if you want us to pursue securing NNG approval for the decommissioning variance.

Jim B.

Jim,
Thank you for the update.  The 2002 Capital Slide/Budget for PGE (excluding subsidiaries) is now consistent with the disclosure schedule, except for the decommissioning increase mentioned below.  I believe as the SPA is written, that we still need to obtaina pproval by NWN as the total amount of the capex is increased (eventhough the funds will come from the decommissioning trust).  Kristina, am I reading this correctly?

Additionally, I have not seen a summary for the PGH II capex or Other numbers that are included in the 5.8d isclosure schedule.  Please confirm that the budget is also consistent for these items as well.

Thank you.

Subject: PGE 2002 Capital Costs and IT Detail


Hello, following up our PGE Budget presentation I am forwarding you the following information.

Jessica - the 2002 Capital Slide has been revised to be consistent with the NNG disclosure schedule.  The decommissioning forecast is up by $1.6 MM, however since this is funded by the decommissioning trust it should not be an issue.

Tracy - Do you have a time and agenda set for the Nov. 1 dry run of the budget presentation?  I may be sitting in for Piro so please keep me posted as to what the plan is.

Rod - you asked for some detail on our IT capital expenditures.  The file IT_Teresa includes the requested detail.  Note that in our UE-115 ratecase we were authorized to expend up to $96.8 MM for the  2000-2002 budget years. This is a balancing account, such that if we don't expend the money we have to refund it to customers.  As an fyi - I've pasted in below the language from our UE-115 Stipulation on IT costs.


Q.  What is the basis for the stipulation relating to issue S-45, CIS / IT Disallowance?

A.  After a Staff review of new IT systems and their associated capital costs, Staff has determined PGE's capital costs for new IT systems to be prudent.  As a result, the Parties agreed to full recovery of PGE's IT investments, subject to a Staff audit.  PGE will place into base rates 100% of the 2002 revenue requirement related to the 2000, 2001, and 2002 capital additions for the CIS/IT capital items listed below.  The 2002 revenue requirement included in base rates will be trued-up to the actual revenue requirement for the CIS/IT capital costs.  OPUC Staff will audit PGE's actual capital expenditures for the CIS/IT capital items listed below.

1. Customer information system.
2. Enterprise resources planning (ERP) system.
3. Network meter reading (NMR) backbone and data store (excluding the meters).
4. Miscellaneous capitalized information technology costs.

Some of the forecasted 2000-2002 capital additions may be delayed until 2003.  Delayed costs can also be recovered, subject to the same Staff audit procedures and standards.  Only those costs that are reasonable and prudent will be authorized for inclusion in the ""actual"" revenue requirement calculation.  Accordingly, customers will receive a refund for any costs PGE does not expend or costs the OPUC finds imprudent.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey Tracy,
 
How are you?  It seems like ages since we've seen each other. 
 
Bunco...well, I know Pam Guidry was the October person, but we figured it
wouldn't happen because she hasn't been to the last couple of Buncos.  Then
the list ended and I haven't heard from anyone complaining.  I'm not sure if
Christi Chickering is still having a Holiday Bunco or not. I'm surprised we
haven't heard from Sandra or Debbie via e-mail. Mary Lynn probably won't
join again, she wants to do a small dinner group with just you, me, Lisa,
Stephanie...the five of us...unless I'm missing someone.
 
Let me know when you're free for lunch, I'm pretty flexible these days.

Hello, Connie!    We're going forward, as planned, with the November 1 DRY RUN Budget Review with Stan Horton, and Jeff Sommers will present for the International Group at this meeting on November 1.   

We have yet to hear from Causey/Lay about rescheduling the November 8 Budget Plan Review meeting with Mr. Lay.   I will keep you posted on this one.

Let me know if I need to further clarify anything.

Tracy inquired what material you want to cover.  Please consider and I will set up a meeting for you and Tracy to discuss in more detail.
Thanks.

Over the past few weeks I have received a great deal of financial information.  Would you have time today to sit down for a few minutes with me and walk through what I have so I make sure that I don't miss anything when I sent the financial section to the data room?  Please call me when you have a moment and let me know if this would be possible.

Thank you for all of your help!

How are you?  It seems like ages since we've seen each other. 
 
Bunco...well, I know Pam Guidry was the October person, but we figured it
wouldn't happen because she hasn't been to the last couple of Buncos.  Then
the list ended and I haven't heard from anyone complaining.  I'm not sure if
Christi Chickering is still having a Holiday Bunco or not. I'm surprised we
haven't heard from Sandra or Debbie via e-mail. Mary Lynn probably won't
join again, she wants to do a small dinner group with just you, me, Lisa,
Stephanie...the five of us...unless I'm missing someone.
 
Let me know when you're free for lunch, I'm pretty flexible these days.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Mary,

I don't work for the Global Employee Services Group (GES).  It was my responsibility to forward to all BU's the plan numbers that were forwarded from Tim Callahan to Agatha Tran.  The GES Group deals 100% with all Expats through out Enron.  If you onto the Internet and get into Planet.enron.com this should provide you with a better idea of what this group provides through out Enron.  According to the employee listing that Tim Callahan provided to backup plan assumptions, ETS has only one employee.  I've attached that information.

Hope this helps.

Thanks,

Patti

Hi James - know Michele has come to you with financial # crunching requests & she would have this time as well, but she's stuck in Duluth (airplane problems).

Anyway, we're putting together/coordinating preliminary bonus recommendations for EGS.  Do you have Q3 IBIT numbers for the various EGS Business Units such as EGS International/NEPCO, Azurix, etc. or is this information that I need to get from each group?

Thanks much./Jana

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

Subject:	2002 PLAN TEMPLATE

Attached is the template to be used for the 2002 Strategic and Operating Plan.  It includes the Income Statement, Indirect Cash Flow Statement, and numerous supplemental schedules.  

As discussed previously, this template requires more detail compared to what has been required in past years.  Some of the detail sheets are linked to certain lines on the summary sheets, so if you encounter an error message regarding a cell being locked, it will be because there is a more detailed sheet for input for that particular item.  Some sheets include check figures, so please make sure these are all reconciled before submitting the file.

A few reminders:
1. Please do not add any lines or alter in any way the 'Format' or 'PRMA' worksheets.
2. Please round all amounts to one decimal place, even within the cell (for example, don't have a cell show 45.2 and have 45.24395135 as the actual number in the cell).
3. Please do not include any embedded links in the file you submit.

With regard to Operating Expenses, there is an SAP Cost Element Mapping worksheet included to assist you in determining where expenses are mapped.

Also, please note that the due date for this file is THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4.

If you have any questions, please contact me (income) or Greg Adams (cash flow).

Thanks,
Steve

Stan,  I wanted to update you on the status of our efforts to implement trading activities and what steps remain.

Accomplished:
Trade system implemented (Caminus system)
Training completed for traders and support personnel
Trade Policy and limits approved
Financial / Risk controls in place thorugh Finance (Jerry Peters, Dan Fancler)
Brokerage contracts executed (Paribas, ABN Amro)
Trade strategies have been reviewed

Remaining:
Fund brokerage contracts with $500,000 margin requirement (we are paid 95% of the 30 day T-bill rates on the account)

We are working with Rod and his group as we continue to get this part of our business up to speed.  As we discussed with you before, both Dave and I have the accountability for the rewards to outweigh the risks for this buisiness component and fully expect this to contribute to our earnings objectives.  If you have any more questions about the commercial business plans please let me know and we'll get something set up, otherwise we'll fund the brokerage accounts and continue with our efforts.

Thanks,

Kent

I would like to have a meeting on October 31st (maybe later if that date won't work), either in the AM or the PM, but probably about 3 hours or so.    I would like to discuss organizations and how we are going to provide the support the EGS organization requires both at Stan's level and at each level in the organization.    I would also like to discuss the top 3-5 concerns you have for your business and your people.   You should decide if there are people in your organization that are needed to discuss basic functions of Planning, Accounting, Finance and Tax and feel free to include them in this process, but I would like to keep the group to Director level or above.    Please let Kathy know who they are.    I would like to know if you are available or have a preference for morning or afternoon.

Thanks.

Rod - What is our policy of accepting direct charges for corporate assistance?   Should this remain in corporate and be a part of the allocation?

Mike - Was any agreement made up front with Brindle to cover Kyle's expenses?   Was the request to travel made by Dave Odneal or yourself?

Kyle Norosky who works in Enron Corp Business Controls, recently flew to Minneapolis with regard to security issues.  He has told me that his trip is to be charged to ETS/Northern Pipeline cost center or project code.

Please can you let me know what company number and code to charge this to.  The total cost of his trip was $1603.28

Many thanks.

2.  Revenue breakdown:
   Assumptions made for the contracted period, as well as the time period
   beyond current contracts - firm/interruptible mix and volumes, tariffs
   for each type of transportation contract
   A build up from contracts to the revenues in the model would be ideal
3.  As before, compressor gas volumes and assumed sales prices for the
projected years
4.  As before, the story as it relates to CERA's view of the world
5.  Explicit calculation of rate base going forward

The old man replied, ""Fill her up!"".

The old man replied, ""HE WANTED TO KNOW IF IT WAS
CASH OR CHARGE, AND I TOLD HIM TO CHARGE IT!""

""Ohhh.."", she said.

The attendant returned with the card, and while the man was signing, he
said,

""I noticed from your license plates and your charge card that y'all are from

Florida. I was in Florida once, and I can tell you that all I can remember
about that trip was that I got the worse piece of ass down there that I've

The old man nodded, and took his card back. The old woman said, ""WHAT'D HE

USA: Enron shares in stay in doldrums after downgrade.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s share price hovered above seven-year lows touched in earlier trade Monday after Moody's Investor Service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of North America's largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status. 
Enron, the largest electricity and natural gas trader in North America, also on Monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks.
Enron shares were down $1.40, or 9.03 percent, to $14.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier in the session trading below $14 for the first time since December 1994. 
Moody's also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded to Baa2, as well as its rating for the Enron's commercial paper. 
Enron's credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day trading operations and its trading partners' perception of making good on trades. With a credit rating hovering above junk status, the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. 
Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

USA: US companies' credit quality to worsen-Moody's.
By Jonathan Stempel

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better, a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on Monday. 
Moody's Investors Service said that in the third quarter, it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 U.S. companies. At the same time, it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies.
That 5.5-to-1 ratio is far greater than the 1.3-to-1 ratio in the second quarter. 
In dollar terms, the situation looks more dire. Moody's warned it may downgrade $543 billion of debt, dwarfing the $66 billion Moody's said it may upgrade by 8.2-to-1. 
""Particularly in light of September 11, the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes,"" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. ""A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year."" 
Rating reviews are significant because, unlike actual rating changes, they are not a ""lagging"" indicator, and suggest the future direction of corporate credit. Moody's normally wraps up its reviews within three months. 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. These include the weakening U.S. economy, an inability of marginal companies to raise cash, debt-financed merger activity and fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance, and travel. 
For example, Moody's in July warned it may cut Comcast Corp.'s ratings after the Philadelphia-based company bid $44.5 billion for AT&T Corp.'s cable TV operations. 
Then last month, Moody's warned it may cut Chicago-based Boeing Co.'s ratings because of the attacks' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes. 
In the third quarter, Moody's warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative-grade, or ""junk""-rated, companies, and raise the ratings of just 11. For investment-grade companies, the gap was even more yawning: 68-to-11. 
And in the fourth quarter? Through Friday, Moody's warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four. On Monday, it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp., and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade. 
Puchalla, however, said the decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
""Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues,"" he said. ""That is a positive for credit quality."" 
The third quarter was the 14th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades. The record is 19 quarters, set between 1988 and 1993.

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

     (Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.30, or 8.4 percent, to
$14.10 in midday trading. Earlier, they touched $13.55, down 12
percent. The company's credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors
Service after it wrote down the value of its assets.

     The stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months.

USA: Enron shares drop despite further triage attempts.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron shares slipped to a new six-year low in early trade as North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader said it was talking to banks about tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron's shares were trading down 90 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $14.60 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares crashed through $15, a low not seen since February 1995.
Last week, Enron shed almost $14 billion in market value as its stock price tumbled more than half since last week, when a series of piecemeal disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
However, many industry observers see Enron's request for an additional credit after tapping its banks for $3.3 billion last week after as a sign a weakness not of strength. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation,"" said Carole Levenson, research analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a move to shore up investor confidence. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on a new credit line.
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
Enron shares sank 50 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $15 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. ((David Howard Sinkman, New York Newsdesk 646-223-6094)).

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a new move to shore up investor confidence after it tapped about $3 billion in credit last week, and to stop a plunge in the company's stock that set new six-year lows. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line.
Enron shares crashed through a psychological barrier of $15 a share, shedding $1.66, or 10.65 percent, to $13.85 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost more than half of its value in the past two weeks, losing more than $14 billion in market capitalization. 
""We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash,"" said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston. 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
""Clearly, both the stock and bond market view Enron as being in dire straits,"" said independent research firm Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson. 
""We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead it's an act of desperation.""

POWER POINTS:Enron May Have To Rethink Asset-Light Focus
By Mark Golden

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- On the face of things, it's hard to understand the stock market's headspinning reaction to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks.
Why the talk of a ""death spiral"" for North America's premier energy trading company? The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), for example, saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12-month period. Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco. 
The difference is that over the past few years, Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question. 
If you're buying network components, you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier. After all, you're buying something you can touch. But if you're buying power or gas, what you're really buying is a commitment to deliver. If your supplier doesn't come through when the market gets tough, you're left totally exposed. In Enron's energy trading business, then, credibility at every level is critical. 
For now, Enron looks to be more than viable. But the company's asset-light strategy might not be. Gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1.65% in the third quarter from 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, asset-heavy energy companies like Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure. 
Two weeks ago, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. That didn't send investors running, however. In fact, its stock price rose a bit on the news. 
What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets, or ""shareholders' equity,"" by $1.2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. That, along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission produced a $15.6 billion drop in Enron's market value. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enron's senior, unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, leaving it two steps above junk-bond levels. The agency kept Enron's ratings on watch for further downgrade. 
Long-Running Concerns 

A 50% hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a 10% reduction in shareholders' equity. The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enron's loss of credibility. Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them, but few on the call believed that. 
For some analysts, Enron's revelations only fed long-running concerns about the company's lack of financial disclosure. 
Cary Wasden, managing partner of Reed Wasden Research, has had a ""sell"" recommendation on Enron since March. Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms, Wasden isn't in the business of selling stock. His firm isn't involved in brokerage and isn't a hedge fund. Wasden gets paid for his research, and the company doesn't invest in the securities it covers. 
A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from one-time sale of physical assets in operating income. His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years - a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldn't immediately respond. 
""Don't believe by any means this is the end of the story,"" Wasden said. 
Wall Street sell-side analysts have largely kept Enron as a ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" as the stock fell from $90 to $20. But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enron's reporting. 
For now, the plunge in the price of Enron's shares and bonds, which last week started trading like junk-rated debt, hasn't hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners. 
""We haven't changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices. We're watching it, and so is everybody else, but they are a solid company,"" Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction. ""This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that I'm sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point."" 
Keeping Talent A Challenge 

Enron is a big company - far too big to ignore. But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders' transactions with Enron. If the company's investment-grade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed, risk managers won't be able to ignore it, whatever else Moody's does. 
Assuming that doesn't happen, Enron still faces a tough road ahead. Like all companies, Enron is the combination of capital and talent. For financial companies, talent is the more important ingredient, and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time. 
New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August, and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year. The losses can be expected to continue. Much of the top management cashed out when the company's stock price was high and moved on. Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on, if they haven't already. 
Over the years, Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry. Those options are now nearly worthless. If Enron's debt-service costs rise, the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America. 
Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top. When Skilling left, nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lay's assurances that it was for ""personal reasons."" When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week, Lay said, ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO."" 
That's putting words in Wall Street analysts' mouths. Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer? 
""I don't know anybody who said that,"" Wasden said. ""What did the CFO do, what did Skilling do, that Ken Lay wasn't part of?"" 
Real change will have to come from without, Wasden said. 
""Enron has been a cult, more than a company,"" he said. ""Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company, it just changes the disciples. Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside."" 
Nevertheless, Wasden thinks Enron's stock has reached its natural floor and, if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money, it can recover over time. 
""There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets, like pipelines and power plants,"" he said. 
That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating. Given the bind Enron is in, Lay won't have much choice. Enron will survive, but it won't be the same company at all.

OFFICIAL CORRECTION Enron long-term ratings downgraded to Baa2 - Moody's

10/29/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

(Moody's corrected its stance on Enron ratings to a downgrade) 
NEW YORK (AFX) - Moody's Investors Service said it has lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Enron Corp from Baa1 to Baa2 following a deterioration in Enron's financial flexibility since the company announced significant writedowns as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments.
The long-term debt ratings remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said. 
Moody's also placed the company's Prime-2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade. 
Moody's initially placed Enron's long-term debt ratings on review on Oct 16. The write-downs and equity charges led to a substantial loss in investor confidence that has led to a more than halving of Enron's share price and difficulties in rolling over commercial paper, according to Moody's. 
In response to these events, Moody's said Enron has shored up its near-term liquidity position by drawing down on all of its committed revolving credit facilities and buying back its outstanding commercial paper, leaving the company with a net cash position of approximately 1.2 bln usd. 
Moody's said it plans to focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties.

USA: Moody's cuts Enron to 2 notches above ""junk"".

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp.'s senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status, and warned it may cut that rating again, as well as its rating for Enron's commercial paper. 
The rating agency cut Houston-based Enron's senior unsecured debt to ""Baa2"" from ""Baa1,"" and said it may cut Enron's ""Prime-2"" commercial paper rating, which affects short-term debt. Its rating actions affect $13 billion.
Moody's said Enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write-downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments this month. This triggered ""difficulties in rolling over commercial paper,"" Moody's said. 
Enron, which has about $63.4 billion in energy assets, said on Monday it is talking with banks to get more credit, after last week drawing down $3 billion from a bank credit line to buy back its outstanding commercial paper. 
Its shares traded Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.75, down $1.75, or 11.3 percent. They have fallen 62 percent since Oct. 12, from $35.81. 
Rating agency, Standard & Poor's, on Thursday revised its outlook for Enron's ratings to ""negative"" from ""stable.""

UK: Europe energy firms wary of Enron on credit worries.
By Stuart Penson

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy companies in Europe are shying away from trading with troubled U.S. energy group Enron amid concerns about the company's credit status, industry sources said on Monday. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron - one of Europe's biggest gas and power traders - as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements, the sources said.
""I think Enron's approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow,"" said the head of risk management at one UK utility that halted its trade with Enron last week. 
""They are talking with us about bank letters of credit,"" he said. ""The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis."" 
A spokesman for Enron's European headquarters in London headquarters declined to comment. 
Reluctance to trade with Enron in Europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five-year lows. 
Triggering the slide was news last week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer. 
Houston-based Enron trades a large amount of its volume in the U.S. and Europe through its Internet EnronOnline system. 
Last Friday the company said trade on EnronOnline was above average levels with more than 8,400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $4 billion. 
Traders said Enron's plight could hit liquidity in European gas and power markets, where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years. 
One industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the UK electricity market had put on hold their trading Enron, which is among the biggest five traders in the market. 
In mainland Europe, where Enron has been a major driver of liquidity, potential counterparties are treading with care. 
""We are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a 'sleeve' (a third party trader),"" said a senior trader at one of Germany's big utilities, who declined to be named. 
French traders said wariness about dealing with Enron had dampened liquidity although Enron was still in the market on Monday morning. 
""Enron is a major player so counter parties are looking to see if there is a problem,"" said one French trader.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Puts Spotlight Back On Broadband
By Michael Rieke

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Thanks to Enron Corp. (ENE), the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money.
But it won't be traders who will cash in on this new potential. It will be class-action attorneys. They're already lining up to sue Enron in at least five shareholder suits. 
As of Oct. 25, two of lawsuits had been filed against Enron in federal court and three more in Texas state court. Most of them name as defendants Ken Lay, Enron's longtime chairman, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence Oct. 25. 
Still another suit, which isn't a class action suit, was filed naming as defendants members of Enron's board of directors. 
All the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships Enron set up, many of them managed by Fastow. Most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the Fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with Enron. 
The transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband, water and other Enron investments. 
Fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions. As Enron's chief financial officer, he was being paid to manage the corporation's finances. As general partner of two LJM partnerships, he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with Enron. He shared in profits of those partnerships. 
When investors began demanding information about the transactions, Enron's share price began to slide. With the heat on, Enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals, among other things. 
That's when the class action attorneys went to work. So far, at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs. Enron didn't respond to calls asking about the lawsuits. 
Among the law firms representing plaintiffs is Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit. The release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $30 billion from class action lawsuits. 
The lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market. Some of the deals with the LJM partnerships run by Fastow ""purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market,"" according to Abrams and Franks v. Enron et al. 
That could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months. Market skeptics have said Enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth. 
Enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties, a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year, according to Enron. 
Now market watchers will want to know if any of Enron's trades were done with the LJM partnerships managed by Fastow. 
They will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with Chewco Investments. That Houston company, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, was managed by Michael Kopper and was set up in 1997 when Kopper was a managing director with Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. He left Enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by Fastow. 
Do the plaintiffs' attorneys know whether Enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships? 
""I think if is too early to tell,"" Thomas Bilek of Hoeffner & Bilek told Bandwidth Beat. ""As you know, (information) is coming out in drabs and dribbles from Enron."" 
It could be several months before plaintiffs' attorneys get a chance to ask Enron officials those questions, Bilek said. 
It's also too early to tell what potential damages plaintiffs could win, said Steven Schulman, an attorney with Milberg Weiss. ""At this point, you can only talk about it in terms of (shareholder) losses, and the losses are in the billions."" 
Total losses will depend on the price each shareholder plaintiff paid for the stock and the price at which each shareholder later sold the stock. 
Enron's share price topped out between $90 and $91 in the summer of last year. It set a 52-week low Oct. 26 at $15.04. That spread leaves plenty of room for losses. 
Schulman told Bandwidth Beat that the record for losses in shareholder cases is $11 billion in a case involving Cendant Corp. (CD). Damages are usually a substantial portion of losses, Schulman said. 
""Whether (the Enron case) is bigger or less, I couldn't opine,"" he said. ""This is a big case, by any means.""

"2002 IM Structure","Tracy, as the ETS overall planner, the Property Accounting Users Group requests that you instruct the ISC to roll over the current IM structure for 2002 for both ETS Consolidated and ETS Un-Consolidated.  This will allow for the setting up of 2002 projects (to be saved they must be attached to a 2002 Budget code)  and when the 2002 capital budget is approved, allow for the inputting of the 2002 budget.  No transfer of dollars is involved in the roll over.  This is strictly a structure roll over.   

Please email Marian Bryant with the ISC the approval for the roll over and the date you would like for this to happen.  The Users group is recommending for this to be done November 1st.   If you have specific questions or concerns, please contact Marian directly, x55944.

Elaine,
This is the response we received from Corp. on allocations to 1202 and 1195.


Mary, 

Other than possibly benefit items, we won't allocate to those companies individually.  I am getting a copy of the Restricted stock allocations and they may have some charges to these companies.  I suspect that any charges to these two are in the ETS-HQ line but will work with Sharon Aulds to confirm.

"Allocations","I'm getting back to something, I left  you a message last week.  When Barney presented the ETS budget for the pipeline operations, he included amounts allocated from ETS for IT ($170k) and Accounting ($59k).  You left me a phone mail  message regarding the IT charge and suggested that I contact Caroline Barnes (which I did today).  Both of these appear to be new charges for 2002 and we'd like to get information on what they relate to.  Can you shed some light on the Accounting charge?

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Autumn Intrigue
Calyx & Corolla Style

Dear Tracy Geaccone, 

Selecting the right gift or seasonal accent to adorn your home
or office is made easy with our original bouquets, orchids and
preserved designs. Each of these intriguing items has its own
character and ambience and is meant to complement the good life.

Take our Orchid Blaze Bouquet for example. With its fiery orange
orchids and black matte vase, it makes the perfect seasonal
centerpiece. This eye-catching bouquet is easy to arrange too.
http://www.etracks.com/r/r0.4?bWWB058y-SYwKtdLmZS5TKaP5ABAu4PcjMq1e

The Colmanara Orchid Plant is quite possibly the most exciting
new orchid to be introduced in the last decade. This alluring
orchid, nicknamed ""Wildcat"" is diligently sought-after for its
long lasting blooms.
http://www.etracks.com/r/r0.4?bWWB058y-SYwKtdLK-Rnlr1HnsFsOPHfovG19

Our Antiqued Holiday Wreath is a preserved design whose color
scheme works with most decors. It is available with our brass
wreath hanger, making it a breeze to display. And don't forget
the ideal autumn birthday gift!
http://www.etracks.com/r/r0.4?bWWB058y-SYwKtdLfAOoIbkXoTzTKnXYtR-18
The Golden Harvest Roses bouquet is sure to add special meaning
to a wonderful occasion.

Jim,
Thank you for the update.  The 2002 Capital Slide/Budget for PGE (excluding subsidiaries) is now consistent with the disclosure schedule, except for the decommissioning increase mentioned below.  I believe as the SPA is written, that we still need to obtaina pproval by NWN as the total amount of the capex is increased (eventhough the funds will come from the decommissioning trust).  Kristina, am I reading this correctly?
 
Additionally, I have not seen a summary for the PGH II capex or Other numbers that are included in the 5.8d isclosure schedule.  Please confirm that the budget is also consistent for these items as well.
 
Thank you.

Subject: PGE 2002 Capital Costs and IT Detail


Hello, following up our PGE Budget presentation I am forwarding you the following information.
 

Jessica - the 2002 Capital Slide has been revised to be consistent with the NNG disclosure schedule.  The decommissioning forecast is up by $1.6 MM, however since this is funded by the decommissioning trust it should not be an issue.
 
Tracy - Do you have a time and agenda set for the Nov. 1 dry run of the budget presentation?  I may be sitting in for Piro so please keep me posted as to what the plan is.
 
Rod - you asked for some detail on our IT capital expenditures.  The file IT_Teresa includes the requested detail.  Note that in our UE-115 ratecase we were authorized to expend up to $96.8 MM for the  2000-2002 budget years. This is a balancing account, such that if we don't expend the money we have to refund it to customers.  As an fyi - I've pasted in below the language from our UE-115 Stipulation on IT costs.
 
 
Q.  What is the basis for the stipulation relating to issue S-45, CIS / IT Disallowance?

A.  After a Staff review of new IT systems and their associated capital costs, Staff has determined PGE's capital costs for new IT systems to be prudent.  As a result, the Parties agreed to full recovery of PGE's IT investments, subject to a Staff audit.  PGE will place into base rates 100% of the 2002 revenue requirement related to the 2000, 2001, and 2002 capital additions for the CIS/IT capital items listed below.  The 2002 revenue requirement included in base rates will be trued-up to the actual revenue requirement for the CIS/IT capital costs.  OPUC Staff will audit PGE's actual capital expenditures for the CIS/IT capital items listed below.

1. Customer information system.
2. Enterprise resources planning (ERP) system.
3. Network meter reading (NMR) backbone and data store (excluding the meters).
4. Miscellaneous capitalized information technology costs.

Some of the forecasted 2000-2002 capital additions may be delayed until 2003.  Delayed costs can also be recovered, subject to the same Staff audit procedures and standards.  Only those costs that are reasonable and prudent will be authorized for inclusion in the ""actual"" revenue requirement calculation.  Accordingly, customers will receive a refund for any costs PGE does not expend or costs the OPUC finds imprudent.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.
Jim B. 503-464-8931

Subject:	2002 Plan Assessments as of 10/19/01 for ETS

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures. 

We will follow up next week with the breakout of each company. 

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments (""8xxxxxxx"" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses (""52502000"" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

"New Course Offerings","Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

Subject:	Sunrise update; Steering Committee meeting postponed

Due to Rick's leadership offsite, the Sunrise Steering Committee meeting this Wednesday morning has been rescheduled for October 2, 10am.  Because of that postponement, the October 17 meeting will be cancelled.  

You may have heard that Mark Frank has moved to EES, where he will Controller for EnronDirect.  We will miss his day to day involvement, but he has expressed an interest in staying involved as a commercial user of the Sunrise data warehouse.  

Here's where we are on the project.  

We are on track for our September 30 data warehouse rollouts of earnings, AP and AR.  Testing is going well, and we appreciate each BU sending users to work with us to test the functionality.  There will be standard reports for each of those new content areas.  Be sure your BU is well represented in the training scheduled for the last 2 weeks of October!

Following the September 30 rollouts, we will have all of our originally planned content in the data warehouse, so we will be concentrating on increasing usage.  We have been presenting roadshows (demos that come to you), which we plan to expand.  In addition, we will be identifying power users in your group who will be experts at both SAP reporting and Business Objects reporting from the data warehouse, so they can advise others as to the best option for a specific reporting need.  Let me know who you'd like us to work with in your group.

The Adaytum planning model is nearly completed.  We are working with Steve Schwarzbach and Greg Adams to ensure that any changes to their excel templates will be incorporated into the model.  We will be running parallel for the 2002 Plan process that is due October 4 - excel templates will be turned in at that time, and the Adaytum model will be completed and reconciled back to the excel results shortly after that.  If your group would prefer to start with Adaytum, we have prepared excel output files and we will come and work with your planners at their desk to get them up and running.  Let us know when you want us to work with you.

Attached is the ENA Allocations Schedule with Revised HR numbers.  In addition, I have once again included a separate file with further support schedules for the various Support Departments.  Please note that the most efficient way to resolve any disagreement with any of the allocations is to contact the Support Department contact directly.  I have included those persons' names on the 2002 Schedule.  I will be happy to assist in answering any questions that I can, but am unable to revise the allocations without a request from that person.

All alloctions will be made based on actuals during 2002.  Actuals will either be assessed on a monthly basis or potentially trued up on a quarterly basis.

Attached please find an updated Allocations schedule from ENA for 2002 Plan.  Please note that the considerable increase in many of the allocations is caused by the decision to include an allocation of bonuses for each support department.  These bonus numbers are based on historical data and are calculated at a high level.  Bonuses were not allocated in the prior year and therefore will cause a considerable variance year on year.

Please contact me with any questions you may have or additional information you may need so that we can resolve any issues in an efficient manner.  After resolution of questions, please provide me your final agreement on these numbers via e:mail.

"RE: ETS  - Investor Questions","Tracy:

Talked with Kim Watson.  This is how she suggested we answer Investor Question 3:

	       West Market - 95% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD
	       East Market -  67% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD

The West and East are two separate markets for TW.  The majority of TW's business is the West market.  
The East market offers our shippers more flexibility.  The two percentages should stand alone and not be 
combined.

Kim felt like these needted to be separate as they are two distinct markets

Thanks!  Hope you have a good weekend and don't get any calls from the office.

	ROE				12.89%	12.18%	13.49%

2. Is rate base calculated on equity or assets?

3. What was the percentage of capacity for each of the pipes for the first nine months of this year?

It would be very helpful if you or someone could respond this afternoon.

"2002 PLAN TEMPLATE","Attached is the template to be used for the 2002 Strategic and Operating Plan.  It includes the Income Statement, Indirect Cash Flow Statement, and numerous supplemental schedules.  

As discussed previously, this template requires more detail compared to what has been required in past years.  Some of the detail sheets are linked to certain lines on the summary sheets, so if you encounter an error message regarding a cell being locked, it will be because there is a more detailed sheet for input for that particular item.  Some sheets include check figures, so please make sure these are all reconciled before submitting the file.

A few reminders:
1. Please do not add any lines or alter in any way the 'Format' or 'PRMA' worksheets.
2. Please round all amounts to one decimal place, even within the cell (for example, don't have a cell show 45.2 and have 45.24395135 as the actual number in the cell).
3. Please do not include any embedded links in the file you submit.

With regard to Operating Expenses, there is an SAP Cost Element Mapping worksheet included to assist you in determining where expenses are mapped.

Also, please note that the due date for this file is THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4.

If you have any questions, please contact me (income) or Greg Adams (cash flow).

Thanks,
Steve

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Danny is requesting a summary of the Weekly Executive Summary (current month forecasted results compared to Plan or CE) for all three pipes.  He would like one starting this Friday.  I am getting copies of everyone's from last week and look for some common data that makes sense to put on one page.  

But in order to get it ready in time, I am asking you to have your own weekly summary (in the exact same format you always do it in)  ready by noon this Thursday, September 27th.  

The Danny Summary would not replace but be in addition to the one you already publish.

We could have someone participate in testing if you like.  We have not been a driver for most of the things being rolled out 9/30.  Our focus has been more on cost data up to this time.  We hope to be able to begin getting g/l balances data.  I think that is also included.  Let me know what you need us to do.

I have attached the resume of LeShawn Edwards who has worked in a contract position in our group since July of this year.  I want to recommend her to you for any openings you may have now or in the future.  She is still actively working in our area, but is seeking permanent employment. Also, if you know of other groups within Enron that might be interviewing for financial team members, please forward her resume. 

The experience LeShawn has gained with the Enron organization and with SAP would be a huge loss if she were to leave Enron.  She has been an great asset in our group and is a diligent and professional individual.  If we had a opening at this time I would not hesitate about hiring LeShawn.  You can see by her resume she has had a very stable work background while also attending the University of Houston, where she graduated last December with a BBA - Finance.
  
If you would like to meet LeShawn, she is located at 3AC-3321.  Her extension is 5-6271.

If you would like more information, please don't hesitate to contact me at 3-5292 or Amy Villasenor, who has worked closely with LeShawn, at 5-5512.

The economic evaluation of applying drag reducing agent to the La Plata to Bloomfield line indicates it is not justified.

When Mary matched up the names & P numbers on the license list with the ETS roster you ran as of 10/9/01, 344 names fell out as not matching.  Can you run an ETS roster for me that is as of 9/17?  This presumably will have fewer fall outs since they ""match in time.""  There will be other situations to deal with but this would help.  If you cannot get the data as of a certain date I will review the list for the names I know and assign them to a company.  Then Mary will distribute the others based on the distribution of the larger population.

Chris Schlaudraff with the ISC gathered the statistics and developed the calculations.  The supporting data for the documents and master data I believe is as of 8/14/01 and the users/licenses are as of 9/17/01 (is this correct Chris?).  This is the ""snapshot"" that was used in calculating ETS' share of the support costs.  The ETS roster which Chris ran for us and I mailed you yesterday is as of 10/9/01.  That is, it indicates who is in what company as of 10/9/01.  Is that correct Chris?

	Greg,
	Several of the legal entities you have used in calculating the ETS allocation for ISC costs are no longer active companies.  All the employees are with another company.  You will need to refigure your matrix when I have gone through the list and identified which company the users work for.

Here is a spreadsheet I have put together to show the 2001 budget vs the 2002 budget.  Steve Hotte will be getting with Danny and ENW on the charges.  We will be inputting the ENW numbers into Adaytum, and will change once Steve has had a chance to renegotiate.   cvb

Do we really have a choice on EOL.  What is the total cost for ETS compared to what we orginally had in 2002?  I need to discuss with Danny.

We have this line on the functional income statement and are handling it.  Please note that the costs have more than doubled and Steve Hotte is preparing to discuss with ENW as to why?  TW EOL charge is $113291 for 2002.  Will Steve Harris want to continue using EOL for that amount??  Since you should have put $35,000 in commercial for EOL, I am reflecting the difference in the ENW line.  cvb

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from ENW for your business unit.  This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments (""8xxxxxxx"" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses (""5xxxxxxx"" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Talked with Kim Watson.  This is how she suggested we answer Investor Question 3:

	       West Market - 95% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD
	       East Market -  67% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD

The West and East are two separate markets for TW.  The majority of TW's business is the West market.  
The East market offers our shippers more flexibility.  The two percentages should stand alone and not be 
combined.

Kim felt like these needted to be separate as they are two distinct markets

Thanks!  Hope you have a good weekend and don't get any calls from the office.

The payment is a non-discretionary obligation for NNG.  I am only suggesting we change the timing of the payment.  In terms of the 2001 3rd Current Estimate, there would be an upside.

I'm not sure why we can't afford it since we have been talking about a much larger base gas purchase transaction.  Has the cash/earnings outlook changed?

Subject:	RE: NNG/Utilcorp $100,000 a month Reserve

I have looked at the Utilicorp reserve, spoken with the Marketing account manager and would like to propose the following:  

Facts:
?	As of August 2001, there is $1.0 million in the reserve account.  
?	The contractual obligation to pay UCU $1.2 million for 2001 can be offset by a $.7million ""credit"" for value given to UCU by NNG Marketing during the year. Thus the amount to be paid to UCU in October would be $.5 million.  
?	The Third Current Estimate now assumes a $.6 million payment..  Reserves are not needed to meet Third Current Estimate.
?	UCU has expressed an interest in banking the $.7million credit from 2001 to 2002 

Recommendation:
?	Defer $.7 million 2001 credit to 2002 - (negotiate time value appropriately)
?	Pay $1.2 million in October 2001(4th quarter)
?	Reverse $1.0 reserve in September (3rd quarter), as it is not longer needed to meet Third Current Estimate.
?	Upside from 3rd Current Estimate 2001 is $.4million. (for the year).
?	No further reserve entries are necessary going forward.


$ Millions	Third CE  2001	Proposal 2001	Plan 2002	Proposal 2002	
Payment	     -1.2	   -1.2	   -1.2	     -1.2	
Credit	        .6	       0	     .6	       -.7	
Sub Total 	      -.6	   -1.2	    -.6	          0	
Reserve Reversal	.	    1.0	      0	          	
Net 	      .-.6	   -.2	   -.6	         -.5	

				

Results:
?	$1.0 million upside to Third Current Estimate for the month of September.
?	-$.6 million downside to Third Current Estimate for the month of October. 
?	$.4 million upside to Third Current Estimate for the year.
?	Shift $.7 million value from 2001 to 2002 for a $.1 upside in 2002.

Thank you for the update.  The 2002 Capital Slide/Budget for PGE (excluding subsidiaries) is now consistent with the disclosure schedule, except for the decommissioning increase mentioned below.  I believe as the SPA is written, that we still need to obtain approval by NWN as the total amount of the capex is increased (eventhough the funds will come from the decommissioning trust).  Kristina, am I reading this correctly?
 
Additionally, I have not seen a summary for the PGH II capex or Other numbers that are included in the 5.8 disclosure schedule.  Please confirm that the budget is also consistent for these items as well.
 
Thank you.

Subject: PGE 2002 Capital Costs and IT Detail


Hello, following up our PGE Budget presentation I am forwarding you the following information.
 

Jessica - the 2002 Capital Slide has been revised to be consistent with the NNG disclosure schedule.  The decommissioning forecast is up by $1.6 MM, however since this is funded by the decommissioning trust it should not be an issue.
 
Tracy - Do you have a time and agenda set for the Nov. 1 dry run of the budget presentation?  I may be sitting in for Piro so please keep me posted as to what the plan is.
 
Rod - you asked for some detail on our IT capital expenditures.  The file IT_Teresa includes the requested detail.  Note that in our UE-115 ratecase we were authorized to expend up to $96.8 MM for the  2000-2002 budget years. This is a balancing account, such that if we don't expend the money we have to refund it to customers.  As an fyi - I've pasted in below the language from our UE-115 Stipulation on IT costs.
 
 
Q.  What is the basis for the stipulation relating to issue S-45, CIS / IT Disallowance?

A.  After a Staff review of new IT systems and their associated capital costs, Staff has determined PGE's capital costs for new IT systems to be prudent.  As a result, the Parties agreed to full recovery of PGE's IT investments, subject to a Staff audit.  PGE will place into base rates 100% of the 2002 revenue requirement related to the 2000, 2001, and 2002 capital additions for the CIS/IT capital items listed below.  The 2002 revenue requirement included in base rates will be trued-up to the actual revenue requirement for the CIS/IT capital costs.  OPUC Staff will audit PGE's actual capital expenditures for the CIS/IT capital items listed below.

1. Customer information system.
2. Enterprise resources planning (ERP) system.
3. Network meter reading (NMR) backbone and data store (excluding the meters).
4. Miscellaneous capitalized information technology costs.

Some of the forecasted 2000-2002 capital additions may be delayed until 2003.  Delayed costs can also be recovered, subject to the same Staff audit procedures and standards.  Only those costs that are reasonable and prudent will be authorized for inclusion in the ""actual"" revenue requirement calculation.  Accordingly, customers will receive a refund for any costs PGE does not expend or costs the OPUC finds imprudent.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.

"20th Anniversary w/ Enron & Remaining 2001 Vacation","
Tracy:

I'm back!  I enjoyed my long weekend.

My 20th anniversary with Enron is today. (I started at a very young age!)   I have already selected my gift and you should be receiving it soon.  It will probably come in a box because I ordered a matching necklace and bracelet.


There are not many days remaining in 2001 and I need to take some vacation days because I have quite a few days left to take.  I have looked at the calendar and hopefully chosen days that will have the least amount of impact on everyone.

Anyway, this is what I came up with:

November 1
November 9
November 19-21 (Thanksgiving week)  I had already made plans to visit my family in Kansas for Thanksgiving
				       before Palu left.  I spoke with Jeanette and she has agreed to do the 
				       weekly on that Tuesday before Thanksgiving, if we do a weekly that week.
				       I don't think we did a weekly last year due to the 3 day work week.
December 7
December 17
December 21
December 31 

I also plan on carrying over 1 week.

Let me know if you have a problem with any of these dates.

Jan

Subject:	2002 Plan Assessments as of 9/19/01 for EREC

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from ENW for your business unit.  This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments (""8xxxxxxx"" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses (""5xxxxxxx"" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

Mark,

In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2nd CE.  It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferred out of EGAS since the 2nd CE  ( Azurix International and South America Merchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East.   This does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe to EGAS in the 4th Qtr.   We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will send you those numbers when we are done.

Hey Tracy,
 
How are you?  It seems like ages since we've seen each other. 
 
Bunco...well, I know Pam Guidry was the October person, but we figured it
wouldn't happen because she hasn't been to the last couple of Buncos.  Then
the list ended and I haven't heard from anyone complaining.  I'm not sure if
Christi Chickering is still having a Holiday Bunco or not. I'm surprised we
haven't heard from Sandra or Debbie via e-mail. Mary Lynn probably won't
join again, she wants to do a small dinner group with just you, me, Lisa,
Stephanie...the five of us...unless I'm missing someone.
 
Let me know when you're free for lunch, I'm pretty flexible these days.

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

Rod,
   I'm a bit unclear as to the source of the information contained in the first two sentences of paragraph 2.  I think that they should more accurately be worded, ""TW benefits from contractual commitments for its firm transportation contracts into California, contracts covering 86% of TW's capacity to California continue through 2005.  Long term risk is mitigated by contracts covering 40% of TW's capacity post 2005, and a settlement agreement with current firm customers.""  This would reflect our position inclusive of Red Rock.
   I'm not sure where their numbers on expiring contracts came from, but I wouldn't have a problem documenting these.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

We have this line on the functional income statement and are handling it.  Please note that the costs have more than doubled and Steve Hotte is preparing to discuss with ENW as to why?  TW EOL charge is $113291 for 2002.  Will Steve Harris want to continue using EOL for that amount??  Since you should have put $35,000 in commercial for EOL, I am reflecting the difference in the ENW line.  cvb

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from ENW for your business unit.  This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments (""8xxxxxxx"" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses (""5xxxxxxx"" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures.  

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments (""8xxxxxxx"" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses (""52502000"" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

I would like to discuss organizations and how we are going to provide the support the EGS organization requires both at Stan's level and at each level in the organization.    I would also like to discuss the top 3-5 concerns you have for your business and your people.   You should decide if there are people in your organization that are needed to discuss basic functions of Planning, Accounting, Finance and Tax and feel free to include them in this process, but I would like to keep the group to Director level or above.    Please let Kathy know who they are.    I would like to know if you are available or have a preference for morning or afternoon.

"La Plata to Bloomfield Drag Reducing Agent Application Evaluation - Estimated Costs","I also wanted to pass on to you the estimated costs that were used:

Below are the rough cost estimates to apply drag reducing agent to the LaPlata to Bloomfield line.

	Facility modifications			$1,665,000

	Cleaning & application			   $165,000

	Re-application every 6 months		   $165,000


The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloomfield and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery.  The cleaning & application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with methanol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application.

For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%.

The re-application time period is also uncertain.  The probable window would be to re-apply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months.

Also, NNG management reports are NOT legal entity, but are ""NNG Group"", which is inclusive of ENE's investment in Trailblazer and Overthrust.
Our only true legal entity financials are historical comparatives and only prepared quarterly and annually for noteholders, and annually for the FERC (Form2).

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Subject:	2002 Plan Assessments as of 9/19/01 for ETS - Northern Plains Natural Gas

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from ENW for your business unit.  This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments (""8xxxxxxx"" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses (""5xxxxxxx"" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

Danette,
I am fine with the Operations Capital Coordinators who require access.  I cannot speak to the other functions, but I didn't see anyone on the list for the FN IM CAPITAL BUDGET APPROVER or FN IM CAPITAL BUDGET CONTROLLER from Operations that should be removed.  I didn't see any Operations people for the other roles that should be removed either.

Operations Capital Coordinators:
Diane Gotto
Elizabeth Jameson
Pallavi Goradia (as supervisor)
Stephanie Bertch
Talbert Loyd
Robert Geheb
Sapana Patel (as backup)

All of these people need to be able to enter the Capital Budget into IM, move dollars in IM and release from IM.

Thanks,  Elaine

"RE: Red Rock (Transwestern) Cashflow","Palu,

Two major items affected the cashflow since August:
1.)  Air permits have been delayed from August, 2001 to November, 2001.  The delay of the air permits impacts construction start dates and delays shipment of material.  Major payments of material, equipment and construction have slipped into 2002 because of the air permit delays.  
2.)  Our compressor vendor has had a few problems.  Their payments are tied to progress.  Our current forecast represents their current payment schedule, which has slipped  as their fabrication has been delayed.

Thanks,

Subject:	Budget: 2001-2002

Per our telephone conversations, property tax information for the budget process is only needed for the calendar years 2001 and 2002.

In order to complete the property tax portion of this process and provide the cash flow analysis for Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company, the Property Tax Department needs the following information for the calendar year 2001:

(1) Net Utility Operating Income (Net Income before Interest & Taxes) 
(2) Capital Expenditures (Income Enhancement/Marketing Projects only): preferably by state, if not; total by company

In order to provide the required information in a timely manner, please forward the aforementioned information to my attention as soon as it becomes available. If you have any other questions or comments, please advise.

"TW Revenues by Counterparty","
First worksheet show summary gross transportation revenue by counterparty for the 12 months ended 9/30/01. Total transport revenue is $180.6 million.  Other worksheets show detail by contract and contract expiration dates.  This information has been furnished to Kevin Howard.  The only open question is how this data can be reconciled to financials.  I spoke with Tracy this morning and she reflects gross operating revenues for TW for this period of $200 M.  The difference is primarily fuel sales (which are not currently included in my numbers).

He may participate but when Dana came to work at EOTT it was agreed that Enron would retain any of those costs.  In fact, we had to get Rod help us with Corporate this year because they tried to bill us for some of these costs in 2001.

Tracy,

10,000 MMBTU/D of incremental capacity from LaPlata to Gallup.

This is the working assumption from our initial conference call.  Like the +/- 30% cost figures below, it may vary with further evaluation, but I suggest it be used for this initial analysis.

Thanks,

Subject:	LaPlata DRA Application Cost Estimate

Tracy,

Below are the rough cost estimates to apply drag reducing agent to the LaPlata to Bloomfield line.

	Facility modifications			$1,665,000

	Cleaning & application			   $165,000

	Re-application every 6 months		   $165,000


The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloomfield and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery.  The cleaning & application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with methanol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application.

For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%.  The re-application time period is also uncertain.  You may want to look at the economics of re-apply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months.

Please let me know of anything else you need.

Thanks,


John

Take all American women who are within five years of Menopause - train us
for a few weeks, outfit us with automatic weapons, hand grenades, gas masks,
moisturizer with SPF15, Prozac, hormones, chocolate, and canned tuna - drop
us (parachuted, preferably) across the landscape of Afghanistan, and let us
do what comes naturally. Think about it. Our anger quotient alone, even when
doing standard stuff like grocery shopping and paying bills, is formidable
enough to make even armed men in turbans tremble.
We've had our children, we would gladly suffer or die to protect them and
their future
We'd like to get away from our husbands, if they haven't left already. And
for those of us who are single, the prospect of finding a good man with whom
to share life is about as likely as being struck by lightning.
We have nothing to lose. We've survived the water diet, the protein diet,
the carbohydrate diet, and the grapefruit diet in gyms and saunas across
America and never lost a pound. We can easily survive months in the hostile
terrain of Afghanistan with no food at all!
We've spent years tracking down our husbands or lovers in bars, hardware
stores, or sporting events...finding Bin Laden in some cave will be no
problem. Uniting all the warring tribes of Afghanistan in a new government?
Oh, please ... we've planned the seating arrangements for in-laws and
extended families at Thanksgiving Dinners for years ... we understand tribal
warfare. Between us, we've divorced enough husbands to know every trick
there is for how they hide, launder, or cover up bank accounts and money
sources.
We know how to find that money and we know how to seize it... with or
without, the government's help!
Let us go and fight. The Taliban hates women. Imagine their terror as we
crawl like ants with hot-flashes over their godforsaken terrain.
I'm going to write my Congresswoman. You should, too!

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.

A portion of the $200k cost is for an EWS team which does Mergers, Aquisitions, and Divestitures(MAD) work.  ETS' allocated cost is approximately $50K for the MAD team but we will only pay for actual charges in 2002 if we use the team.

Judy --

We're seeing Enron sell off just like a lot of other companies.  The CEO
(Skilling) and CFO (Fastow) have recently removed themselves and enough
cash to remain comfortable for some time.  There may be a good reason for
the sell-off.  Various accelerators on the way up could have turned into
brakes on the way down.  It looks like Enron has been bitten by too much
leverage and creative financing -- recently it appears that there are
contingent liabilities related to its water utility deals.  There is a lot
of off-balance sheet financing and potentially undisclosed risk.  So I
would not be surprised to see the stock continue to fall and not recover
much unto perceptions are set right with investors.  This isn't going to
happen overnight.

Anyway, I'm out of the stock market
a) until AAA corporate bonds start to turn up, indicating increased
prospects for corporate profitability
b) until it's clear that the middle east blowup is under control
c) maybe next year at this time - the 15 months from Oct - Dec before an
election year are best for the stock market.

I think there's still too much risk, prices are too high, and the bond
market may be the best choice for a few more years.
And I've been really, really busy.

Stan,  I wanted to update you on the status of our efforts to implement trading activities and what steps remain.

Accomplished:
Trade system implemented (Caminus system)
Training completed for traders and support personnel
Trade Policy and limits approved
Financial / Risk controls in place thorugh Finance (Jerry Peters, Dan Fancler)
Brokerage contracts executed (Paribas, ABN Amro)
Trade strategies have been reviewed

Remaining:
Fund brokerage contracts with $500,000 margin requirement (we are paid 95% of the 30 day T-bill rates on the account)

We are working with Rod and his group as we continue to get this part of our business up to speed.  As we discussed with you before, both Dave and I have the accountability for the rewards to outweigh the risks for this buisiness component and fully expect this to contribute to our earnings objectives.  If you have any more questions about the commercial business plans please let me know and we'll get something set up, otherwise we'll fund the brokerage accounts and continue with our efforts.

Thanks,

Kent

The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.

"2002 Plan Assessments as of 10/19/01 for ETS","Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures. 

We will follow up next week with the breakout of each company. 

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments (""8xxxxxxx"" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses (""52502000"" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

"2002 budget presentation","While I totally agree with the decision to show an EGS/International operating budget for the full year. However,  I am concerned that we do not have recommendations for the OTC regarding divestitures.  I would think we would want to sit down with Andy and Jeff and go through the inventory of companies in order to put a divestiture plan in place.

I would like to get a feel from the OTC of how much pain they are willing to accept to sell down some of these assets.  The schedule that Louie handed out the other day may have been a good start but I doubt all of that can be accomplished within the 2002 time frame.

I believe the we are going to have to commit to the financial community a sell-down number and how much cash that raises.  I think this really needs to be part of EGS & Corporate Development's 2002 stategy.

I wanted to get your thoughts prior to setting up a meeting.

Subject:	Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage


To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

"TMS Shipper Scheduled Quantities Report","
I just ran several Shipper Scheduled Quanties reports and discovered the fomat had changed.  

I monitor several contracts for forecasting purposes and also provide Market Services invoicing 
information for revenues for negotiated rates and sharing revenues for volumes flowing West for USGT. 
I rely upon the Shipper Scheduled Quantities report to get the information I need.  Before the change, 
I was able to run 1 report for each of these shippers each week, a total of 3 reports.  Because the new 
report does not give me month-to-date totals I now have to run a report for each shipper for each gas day, 
a total of 21 reports each week.  It is very time consuming to run and analyze all these reports.  As 
Marketing does more of these sort of deals the volume will only grow. 

It is critical that I get a report that gives me month-to-date totals so I don't have to run a report for each shipper
for each day.  Is there some way you could revise the report to again show the month-to-date totals?

Minor comparisons:

1)  The 2nd portion of the original report had an area where you could quickly glance at either your receipt
           or delivery point totals.  In order to get a break out of receipt and delivery points now, you have to run 1 
           report sorted by receipt point and 1 report by delivery point.

2)	This is very minor, but I also liked the fact that the report was on letter size paper.  All my files have 
            been set up to accomodate that size of report.  I now have to set up new files.


I appreciate any help you can give me in this matter.

Thanks!

"FW: 2002 Plan Assessments as of 10/19/01 for EREC","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Yparraguirre, Jay  
Sent:	Friday, October 19, 2001 10:21 PM
To:	Geaccone, Tracy; Pritt, Deborah; Lambert, Chris
Subject:	2002 Plan Assessments as of 10/19/01 for EREC

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures.  

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments (""8xxxxxxx"" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses (""52502000"" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

Monthly Briefing 



Title: Monthly Gas Briefing: A Shift Toward Winter 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2748;


***********************************************************************

NATURAL GAS PRICES REBOUND AS HEATING SEASON APPROACHES

Despite high storage levels, with heating season coming, the Henry Hub cash 
market has bounced back from early October lows to levels near $2.40 per MMBtu. 
However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased 
US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA 
expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.

*  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are 
increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year. 

*  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential 
and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a 
weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the 
industrial sector.

*  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward 
pressure off of regional differentials. The Northeast examines security issues 
around LNG shipments.

Subject:	2002 Plan Assessments as of 9/19/01 for ETS - Transwestern Pipeline Co.

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from ENW for your business unit.  This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments (""8xxxxxxx"" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses (""5xxxxxxx"" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

Stan,  I wanted to update you on the status of our efforts to implement trading activities and what steps remain.

Accomplished:
Trade system implemented (Caminus system)
Training completed for traders and support personnel
Trade Policy and limits approved
Financial / Risk controls in place thorugh Finance (Jerry Peters, Dan Fancler)
Brokerage contracts executed (Paribas, ABN Amro)
Trade strategies have been reviewed

We are working with Rod and his group as we continue to get this part of our business up to speed.  As we discussed with you before, both Dave and I have the accountability for the rewards to outweigh the risks for this buisiness component and fully expect this to contribute to our earnings objectives.  If you have any more questions about the commercial business plans please let me know and we'll get something set up, otherwise we'll fund the brokerage accounts and continue with our efforts.

Thanks,

Thank you for your hard work and your continued commitment to the March of Dimes. 

Enron's 2001 WalkAmerica campaign was the #14 Walk Team in Houston, contributing $72,563 to the March of Dimes. In addition, Danny McCarty was the #2 fundraiser in the city, raising $20,350, and Sophie Patel was the #5 fundraiser, raising $10,002.

In appreciation of all your efforts for WalkAmerica and the March of Dimes, you and a guest are invited to the 2001 March of Dimes' WineFest on Thursday, October 4 from 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. at the Crystal Ballroom of the Rice Hotel. It will be a great evening of food, wine, friends, and a silent auction.

Please let me know by Friday, September 28, if you will be able to attend WineFest 2001.

Thank you, again, and hope to see you there.

Here's the revised budget.  Michael, please assess the timing of capital draw downs (eg, quarterly spends) against the IBIT target to make sure we have synchronized estimates.  I assume that capital drawn down during Q1 would require 4/4ths of IBIT requirement, Q2 would require 3/4ths of IBIT requirement, etc.  The current numbers indicate all capital would be drawn down in Q1, which is not the case.

"Staff Meeting","I know I have been absent from the 2 regularly scheduled meetings on Friday am for the last 2 weeks and it is not going to get a lot better for the next 2 weeks either.   For this I apologize, but I am trying to understand the new expanded world to determine any potential points of integration, if any.    I am going to have Kathy see if there is a time earlier in the week that we might be able to use for direct reports and administrative matters and a separate time for Commercial support reviews.  Please keep the reports flowing  as this is currently my means of keeping up.     I would like for staff meetings to continue, even in my absence for the next 2 weeks.

I am working on some organizational changes, which I am not quite ready to discuss, but they should not impact the majority of you at all.     I will not be replacing me in my old position in ETS, but will be expanding the crew to include the worlds of EGAS, Wind, Azurix, EEOS, Portland (they will be here for most of the next year) etc.     In the meantime if you need to talk to me please have Kathy get you in to my schedule in person or via phone.    I am also in the office nearly everyday, other than tuesday (EOTT staff meetings), by 6:30 am.

Subject: Nov 8 Schedule for Peggy Fowler


Tracy,
Peggy's flight is scheduled to arrive at 12:06 and depart at 6:55.

So depending on how traffic is, it seems like you could schedule her at
2:30-3:00.  Which would give her enough time to get to the meeting and
enough time to catch the plane given rush hour traffic and the increased
check in time at the airport.

Let Mary and I know if this works for you.

Gina and Jo- I'm pulling together some information regarding the company's total spend on PR and Gov't Affairs.  I'm in contact with the individual pipeline groups regarding their state level GA spend.  Can you provide me any 2002 budget and headcount estimates for the GPG corporate groups?  I understand that the business units prepare their budgets later than Corp., but even rough numbers would be helpful.

Thanks for your help!
