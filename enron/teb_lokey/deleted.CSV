"RE: *EMCA* Response from Reliant - HL&P","Reliant also is going through other neighborhoods.  

My mother lives right near Bellaire and Reliant came through and told her
that they have 7' of space in the right-of-way.  They cut down 3 of her 52

Those tree had never harmed anything - even through Alicia (Hurricane).

Subject: *EMCA* Response from Reliant - HL&P


Neartown neighbors,

The attachment is a response to my information request concerning Reliant -
HL&P's installation of the big poles. Conversations after my letter's
receipt moved in the direction of possible community meetings where R-H
would explain what they were doing and answer our many questions.

Last Tuesday R-H informed me that since the installation project would be
completed by the end of this month, that the attachment would be sufficient
for their communication purposes. A meeting with us was not necessary.

The R-H spokesperson readily admitted that there had been no attempts to
obtain community imput/feedback prior the new pole installation.

I'm disappointed and frustrated. I need your thoughts on how to proceed.

Read the attachment and tell me what you think should happen next.

Thanks

The way the dpoa is set up now is the way it would be reflected if the two contracts were combined.  However, if the contracts are combined, does that mean that we would make the point a division?  If so, the problem is solved, otherwise, we're back to the same issue.  nb

I agree with Teb.
The ""book-out"" is GTC Section 14.A.

Not sure what you mean by ""Balancing Entities"".
The same DPOA covers both contracts.
But, there are two contracts.
And, the two contracts are accounted for separately.
Each contract must be ""balanced"".
(Whether covered by one DPOA or two DPOAs.)
Is that what you mean?

Since FPU holds two FTS-1 contracts (according to Nancy), 
we could probably combine them (if FPU wants top do that).
Jim says that we did that for Peoples.
We would have to check and see if there was any reason not to combine.
If they were combined, then there would be balancing under one contract.

	I spoke with Chris Snyder this morning and his request is to add New Smyrna as a 4th Division to his existing 3 Divisions in order to have one Balancing Entity  vs.. Two Balancing Entities so he can net imbalances together. He is not looking for section 11 rights and he knows the New Smyrna lateral is constrained and he can not move any additional volumes there. Chris right now will have to deal with Two Balancing Entities and this is what he is trying to avoid. He will do what ever it takes on his end that we require/request. Please take another look with the one reason (Balancing) in mind. Give me your feedback. Thanks... John.

informative and productive meeting.  Never fear however; we assigned you

do towards our goal of making our neighborhood the most fabulous in
town.  Any little bit of effort that you can contribute is well
appreciated and often leads to fun and getting to know your wonderful
neighbors.

There has been much talk and messaging about reviving the once vital,
now dormant Citizen Patrol.  It now time to put your money where your
mouth is.  We have received the necessary information and materials from
Officer Roeder and plan to make this the focus of our March EMCA
meeting.

This is the procedure for starting up our own patrol:

-- You must express interest by replying to this e-mail.
-- You must attend the March meeting which will also be the Citizen
Patrol
      Introduction Meeting.
-- You must sign the Citizen Patrol Introduction Meeting Roster.

If enough people show interest, attend the meeting, and sign the roster
which we will turn in to Officer Roeder, we will all then receive an
official training from HPD.

So if you want to see the return of the Citizen Patrol, now is the time
to act.  There you have it.

Hope to see you around and next month.

"Re: *EMCA* Bomar and Morgan","Last night I attended the District D Capital Improvement Prep Session,
Northwest Quadrant, which was also a Super Neighborhood meeting. I was
wearing my two new hats as a representative of the East Montrose Civic
Association and a member of Ada Edwards' District D Infrastructure Action
Team.  Mike Shannon from the city's finance and administration--the
people we have to send our CIP requests to--and David Leal an engineer
from the city's Public Works and Engineering departament were there.  


The Bomar and Morgan high water problem was the only issue I addressed. 
I have some Citizen Request Forms. If someone from the Bomar-Morgan spot
would like to fill one out or help me fill one out, I can hand deliver it
to city hall.  This isn't a bad idea, and it might, possibly result in
something being done between 2003 and 2007.


But I think it's also urgent that we try to get something done now.  Both
Shannon and Leal agreed that it was a good idea to try to work through
our council members at the same time to try to get something done.  As I
explained last night, we don't know what needs to be done: Is there a
storm sewer under Bomar in that block and should there be a drain at that
spot?  (I personally believe in a flat place like Houston and with
Houston's construction and maintenance crews what they are, the best way
to get water away from your property is a ditch.)  


If I can get a copy of the engineer's letter, I'd like to get it to Mr.
Leal.

This is a mate to another one that was sent around a couple of weeks ago, which said: Note to the Taliban: Hand over Osama Bin Laden or we will take all your women and send them to college. 
 
 

>> As for what to do with Osama bin Laden: Killing him will only create a martyr. Holding him prisoner will inspire his comrades to take hostages to demand his release.

Therefore, I suggest we do neither.

 
Let the Special Forces, Seals or whatever, covertly capture him, fly him to an undisclosed hospital and have surgeons quickly perform a complete sex change operation.  Then return her to Afghanistan to live as a woman under the Taliban.

Since he's planted grass instead, I suggest you call the City--there's a new
director of Public Works, but Amy has some contact names down there.  If they
don't push the issue, then call your new Council Member, Ada Edwards, because
she's eager to make herself helpful to Montrose.

Good luck.

"*EMCA* Reliant- HL&P & other items","Neartown neighbors,

1....The community e-mail response to Reliant- HL&P's (R-H) press release on the installation of the big poles has been significant. More so than anything else to date.  

A busy afternoon and evening kept me from seeing Channel 11's Saturday afternoon news item filmed earlier that day on Peden. Did you see it? Did anybody? Was it even aired at all?

I will continue to follow-up w/ R-H on one aspect that C.11 found very nteresting. Described best by an excerpt from my written response to R-H's no-community-meeting decision....""Of the various items we discussed on the phone that could position R-H in a better light, two merit your consideration. To reduce or deflect the visual intrusion of the large metal battleship gray poles, I suggested that the civic associations involved be allowed to paint, decorate or disguise the poles. 

The civic associations, working with guidelines established by your company, would determine through a publicized competition, which designs the community wants to see or live with on their streets.

The other idea is the installation of wood poles along the freeway side of the Dunlavy park baseball field. The Neartown Little League would then hang netting on the poles to prevent foul balls from falling into freeway traffic.""


2....Last week I reported something that turns out to be an error. The metal poles and lines along Dunlavy as they cross the freeway bridge going south, do NOT go underground at North or South Blvds or under any street in that area. A few of you let me knows about that, and I finally went to see for myself. The power lines and poles turn west along the freeway after the bridge. Should have checked that sooner before beating the R-H guy silly with that ""fact."" 

3...This is the week to submit Capital Improvement Plans (CIP) for District D at either a Tuesday or Thursday evening meeting. 

Neartown-Montrose Super Neighborhood Council ....will submit five super neighborhood action plans that include the reconstruction of three major east-west traffic corridors and plans for two area parks. 

Neartown Association will submit two requests...A. asking the mayor to declare all of Montrose a neighborhood to Standards area so that all streets can be placed in the Street Overlay Program and to address widespread storm drainage problems.
B....Requesting that 4-way stop signs be placed around all parks and public, private and parochial schools. Not exactly a CIP item, but we are taking advantage of the moment to present this anyway. 

Cherryhurst Park, North Cherryhurst, Vermont Commons, First Montrose Commons and East Montrose are submitting CIP proposals.It's not to late for you as an individual, block face, street, neighborhood or community association to participate in submitting a proposal for the COH to place on next year's budget to turn that proposal into a project. Call me and I'll fax you a CIP form and/or discuss what you have in mind.

4.....Neartown Little league's first game is in a few weeks and there's still time for your kids to participate. Call me or NLL president, Will Weber at 713-527-8685.

"*EMCA* RE: Distemper - some info","

Thanks for the additional information - that's way more succinct and clear
than anything I found.
I'm not sure TWRC will test for which kind of distemper it is, if the
treatment is the same.  They're an underfunded non-profit - is there any
other kind? - and I doubt they'll worrry about identifying the exact bug
involved.
I think maybe if your dog's distemper shots are up to date, you're ok. 

A roommate's cat caught FIV from a hostile stray on Fargo - unfortunately I
think we have to assume unknown critters could be a threat to household
pets.  I do foster strays sometimes, but I don't let them near my own cats
until I get clearance from my vet.

"Re: *EMCA* Reminder - Community Garage Sale","Hello Amy
In a previous mail, you mentioned we could go to the police station 
to pick up maps and balloons. I looked in yahoo what was the nearest 
station and it says it is in beechnut street. Is it the station you 
are talking about or is there another one closer to our area ? If so 
would you be kind enough to tell me where it is ? Thanks a lot.

"*EMCA* Bomar/Morgan Drainage","EMCA Infrastructure Friends,

Here's what I learned in the last few years regarding the poor 
drainage at the corner of Bomar & Morgan.

1.  Hillary is correct about the method for fixing the problem.  Jew 
Don Boney (fmr. Dist. D Councilman) told us/me at several forums, 
that using official COH channels is the only way to get things done.  
Last year's ""wish list"" presented by Amy Barnes to Jew Don Boney 
likely resulted in some minor fixes to East Montrose.  However, 
formal requests on COH paperwork is desireable, since the Dist. D 
councilperson can more easily track the progress through the City 
offices.

2.  I requested, by phone, that both sides of Morgan Street have 
their ditches dug out.  Only the east side (309 Bomar and 308 
Willard) was performed.  The workers didn't realize they needed to do 
both sides and said they would return another day to work on the west 
side.  Naturally, they never returned.  A solution could be as easy 
as calling the ""Storm Drain"" office and requesting that the 
appropriate addresses (401 Bomar & 402 Willard) have their ditches 
redug along Morgan.  By the way, it took about 5 months after my call 
for the workers to do half the job.

3. Candelaria Moreno (405 Bomar) told me that there was once a ditch 
along Morgan Street, between Bomar & Willard.  It was partially 
filled in during a prior Morgan Street resurfacing. The poor drainage 
was a direct result of this work.  Since she has lived at this 
address for more than 30 years, I don't know when that event occurred.

4.  Unless the City decides to build a sports arena at 401 Bomar 
Street, they are unlikely to construct a proper storm drain.  
Therefore redigging the ditch seems the only short term solution.

GOOD LUCK!!!

Your friend & ex-neighbor,
Scott Long

"*EMCA* NTA on Ch. 11 this afternoon about Reliant","Neartown neighbors,

Turn on Channel 11 news this Saturday afternoon and watch me blither about Reliant-HL&P's installation of the big utility poles.

Thanks to whomever sent the e-mails about the Reliant press release to Ch.11. This resulted in a walk along Peden looking at the poles in front of residences. 

On this beautiful weekend nobody NOBODY is home. Knocked on doors along Peden, nobody answers. Called all around throughout leadership, nobody answers. It was short notice and I would have perferred someone else on camera.

So if you are at home to catch this e-mail in time, let's see how it plays this afternoon, if Ch.11 decides to run the story at all.
Never know.

Thanks,

Ed Gonzales

"F.P.U. NEW SMYRNA DELIVERY POINT QUESTION","
	I spoke with Chris Snyder this morning and his request is to add New Smyrna as a 4th Division to his existing 3 Divisions in order to have one Balancing Entity  vs.. Two Balancing Entities so he can net imbalances together. He is not looking for section 11 rights and he knows the New Smyrna lateral is constrained and he can not move any additional volumes there. Chris right now will have to deal with Two Balancing Entities and this is what he is trying to avoid. He will do what ever it takes on his end that we require/request. Please take another look with the one reason (Balancing) in mind. Give me your feedback. Thanks... John.

"*EMCA* Reliant-HL&P../.those big ugly poles....need your imput","Neartown neighbors,

Now talking w/ Reliant-HL&P folks. Pushing for a community meeting w/ a presentation of their plans in Montrose. Will be this month, will know more this week.

Want to avoid pre-packaged p.r. put-offs, I prefer an open give & take session w/ them and the community in one room.

  1.. What I need from you in anticipation of this event are questions. What information do we want? What do we need to know? What do we want them to do? 
  2.. Call, e-mail, fax or snail-mail me or your community leader now!
With too many fish to fry on one burner, I cannot think of everything, and need your help in making the most of this opportunity.

What I've heard from other sources........
.....Reliant-HL&P is progressing through a 10 year plan that's in place now.
My question...Where's the community imput?

.....Haven't seen it yet, but this is from a highly credible & sober source....the big poles already in place along Dunlavy. Follow the lines & poles south of the SW Freeway, then the lines go underground at North & South Blvds, then come back up again. My question....How come there, and not Montrose?

Respond to the #1 and #2 now. Be nice.

"*EMCA* Linoleum for sale","I have a 6 1/2' x 8 1/2' sheet of genuine Linoleum, just like they used to
use in the '30's and '50's in homes and office buildings.  It is a
buff/yellow color, with grey swirls.  It's brand new and left over from when
they did my new kitchen floor (they mis-measured and ordered too much).

Linoleum is a all-natural product, made with linseed oil and cork, and
that's about it.  It wears like iron, is easy on the feet, and has a cool
retro look.

I believe Linoleum installs just like conventional vinyl flooring.  The only
trick is if you have to seam two pieces together, in which case you need a
special ""heat seal"" tool, and lots of expertise.  But, if you have a small
bathroom or very small kitchen, this one sheet should do nicely.

I paid nearly $2,000 to have my small kitchen re-floored in this linoleum.
You can have this piece for a mere $75.

"*EMCA* Fw: Neartown Meeting this Tuesday night"," 
Note to EMCA residents:
 
This ""follow-up"" on the HPD Sweep in our area should be VERY informative and relevant.  Please make time to attend.
 
Amy Barnes

 
Community Leaders & Members,
 
Neartown's monthly meeting is next Tuesday night (10-23-01) at 7pm. Cherryhurst Park Community Center, 1700 Missouri.
 
1....This big agenda item is the return of HPD's command officers to give us an after-action report on the enhanced police presence & foot patrols of September. We'll hear about what citations were made, the number of arrests and HPD's impact on area crime. 
 
We'll also learn what we can do to keep this momentum going.
 
This is also your opportunity to address HPD on any crime or safety issue in your neighborhood.
 
2....Neartown-Montrose Super Neighborhood Council. It's official since last week and the non-residential members will be introduced at the meeting. [Montrose Business Alliance, Neartown Little league, Pride Committee, Montrose Community Church, Neartown Community Partnership & Greater Hou. Gay-Lesbian Chamber of Commerce]
 
3...This is the last meeting before the November 6th election and I'm inviting all candidates for all offices to be there for an introduction. It's an open invitation to all 27 candidates, but with event scheduling getting tighter just before 11-6, I do not expect more than two or three to show up.
 
We'll also talk about the 11-27 Garage Sale and the Prevailing Lot Size Amendment.  Please be there to represent your neighborhood, your community and take this opportunity to talk w/ HPD.
 
Thanks

  Subject: Re: *EMCA* Bomar and Morgan


  Last night I attended the District D Capital Improvement Prep Session, Northwest Quadrant, which was also a Super Neighborhood meeting. I was wearing my two new hats as a representative of the East Montrose Civic Association and a member of Ada Edwards' District D Infrastructure Action Team. Mike Shannon from the city's finance and administration--the people we have to send our CIP requests to--and David Leal an engineer from the city's Public Works and Engineering departament were there. 

  The Bomar and Morgan high water problem was the only issue I addressed. I have some Citizen Request Forms. If someone from the Bomar-Morgan spot would like to fill one out or help me fill one out, I can hand deliver it to city hall. This isn't a bad idea, and it might, possibly result in something being done between 2003 and 2007.

  But I think it's also urgent that we try to get something done now. Both Shannon and Leal agreed that it was a good idea to try to work through our council members at the same time to try to get something done. As I explained last night, we don't know what needs to be done: Is there a storm sewer under Bomar in that block and should there be a drain at that spot? (I personally believe in a flat place like Houston and with Houston's construction and maintenance crews what they are, the best way to get water away from your property is a ditch.) 

  If I can get a copy of the engineer's letter, I'd like to get it to Mr. Leal.

"Re: *EMCA* Bomar and Morgan","Scott Long, our former resident in the cute corner cottage at Morgan and
Bomar, did a lot of work on this issue.  He made photographs of standing
water (some of which came up on his lawn to the porch!), and he went to
the CIP hearings with Amy and me and made the presentation.  Let's ask
him if he possibly kept any of that material or if he recalls to whom he
gave it.

This is also one of the reasons that a prospective buyer (who wanted to
build a single family house there) backed out of buying the vacant lot
across Morgan from him.

The City has a file on this, and the former Council Member for District
D did also.

I think Ada Edwards may want to take this on.  Let's ask Annise for her
advice in how to proceed.

Annise?

"Oct. 11 FERC meeting discussion items","Below are summaries of the major cases discussed at today's FERC Open Sunshine Meeting.  More detailed summaries and analysis of the attendant orders will be included in the Weekly Report next week, or may be sent out as supplemental reports as the orders are issued.


OFO Presentation and Discussion, GX01-1 [Item G-1]

In a Power Point presentation Staff discussed OFOs, citing past customer concerns that gave rise to Order 637 revisions, and recommending further remedies in the form of monitoring mechanisms (see bullets from presentation below).  

The crux of the discussion among the three Commissioners (Commissioner Massey was absent due to illness) is that FERC will monitor pipeline OFO habits proactively to look for patterns of abuse on particular systems. Such a pattern could the need for additional facilities to alleviate constraint points.

Commissioner Breathitt agreed to the approach outlined, but indicated that it would be prudent to allow Order 637 revisions time to work. She noted that the issue is and has been pipeline specific, not industry-wide.  Commissioner Brownell also clarified that, though the monitoring mechanism (through EBB postings and reports to Commission) is new, the Commission has not seen a recent pattern of abuse - the mechanism is designed to anticipate future problems.
 
Presentation bullets:

Commission's Goals

Ensure reliable service;
Minimize OFOs, maximize market forces and customer flexibility;
Give shippers information needed;
Monitor OFO abuse to identify system constrain points.

Initiatives to Achieve Goals

Order 637 to enhance market design rules;
Market monitoring;
Necessary infrastructure additions.

OFO Definition

Issued by pipelines to maintain service reliability;
Can be system-wide or limited to specific pipeline segments;
Typically restricts use for receipt/delivery points;
Requires shippers to stay in balance at tightened tolerance levels.

OFO Addressed in Order 637

Too ill defined; too large in scope;
Remains in effect too long;
Market affiliates unduly benefit;
Shippers not informed on timely manner;
Level of OFO penalties excessive.

Order 637 Remedies

Better define OFO;
Develop a continuum of emergency measures;
Timely inform shippers of OFO;
Set proper OFO penalty level and credit revenues to shippers;
Require OFO activity report.

Market Monitoring

Staff will oversee OFO activity;
Oversight will rely on EBB postings; pipeline reports, and other sources.


Efficient and Effective Collection of Data,GX01-2  [Item G-22]

Chairman Wood called this item for discussion in response to queries from the American Public Gas Association (APGA) about what actual market data is generally available for the natural gas industry.  This issue came out in part due to the AGA storage data error that occurred a month or so ago.  APGA suggests the following information be available:
1.	Production
2.	Production capability (and resulting utilization rate based on #1 and #2)
3.	Pipeline capacity
4.	Operational capacity (and resulting utilization rate based on #3 and #4)
5.	End-use by customer class

Because of the AGA ""hiccup"" on its data storage numbers, Chairman Wood would like to see more than one data source for important market information (though it may not be FERC's job to collect such data). Commissioner Brownell suggested the establishment of a stakeholder group to determine what kind of information is needed, if any information is collected and not used, and how collected information will serve the market.  Staff noted that several information collection items are being developed for the 2002 FERC Business Plan, and the APGA list may be incorporated into that effort. 

East Tennessee Expansion for new generation, CP01-80  [Item C-1]

This case, in which an East Tennessee expansion to serve a new generation load is approved, was called by Chairman Wood in response to a specific issue raised by APGA.  APGA is concerned that the ""proliferation of pipeline projects"" to serve generation are being approved without consideration of the resultant impact on the nation's gas customers - that impact being the exacerbation of natural gas prices across the board.  Chairman Wood said he wanted to clarify publicly that, as stated in the order, it is not FERC's job to decide ""why any person needs gas?.the public is best served when the market dictates"" price and supply.  He pointed out that the Commission's certificate policy is very direct and clear on risk, and he is comfortable with that state of affairs.

Generation Interconnection, EX01-5  [Item E-1]

The Commission agreed to establish a Straw Man model (probably using the ERCOT model) to modify generation interconnection procedures, service agreements and rights. This process will precede a NOPR that will establish interconnection standards to alleviate complaints, constrictions and delays in processes. Once the Straw Man method is finalized, the NOPR will have an accelerated process in which to comment, reply and implement in a final rule.  This is ""Step One"" of the process, with ""Step Two"" to be a subsequent and separate NOPR to examine and resolve the cost responsibility issues related to interconnection standards.  The Commissioners agreed that splitting the financial aspect out into a separate proceeding will allow for an ""easy win"" on the establishment of standards.  Cost issues include a) allocation between generators and providers and b) common costs recoverable across all users. 

Carolina Power & Light, ER01-1807  [Item E-15]

Chairman Wood called this case for discussion to highlight a change in Commission policy.  In this case, FERC is imposing the gas model for penalty revenue crediting to electric transmission providers.  Described as a ""market based imbalance solution,"" the prospective change requires that revenues from imbalance penalties should be credited back to non-offending customers.  The exact mechanism for such crediting has not been outlined in the Carolina order.  Commissioner Brownell reiterated that this approach ""sends the right economic signals"" to transmission customers to stay in balance.

"Re: *EMCA* Welch Uprising","Well, on my walk this morning , at the corner of Welch and Crocker, I stopped to watch, yet another, street crew about to dig up Welch.  Evidently, the response was so immediate from our ""concerned citizens"" that theCity had the contractor put his equipment back on the truck and leave.  A security guard was standing watch to make sure there was no uprising.  So I guess those calls help, at least in this time of impending elections.

Well Kids i'm back. 
It seems that a sub-contractor had an illegal city of Houston sign placed 
on the job site and did't get a permit to cut up new pavement. So as it 
stands the subcontractor will  have to pave the entire block. Watch the 
10pm chan.  11 news.

"Re: *EMCA* here are some pics","What a neighborhood!!  The pictures were wonderful.  I knew I wouldn't have any trouble printing the .jpg files, but I was surprised how easy it was to print from the .pdf file.  Each picture was a page.  I'm explaining that this is a test case: we want to see if District D can solve problems for us.  Ada Edwards has a great idea to set up a little neighborhood office next to the storefront police station.  I'm willing to help, but only if we can get results.  We don't need a public relations gimmick.

"*EMCA* Attempted Break In on Morgan","I have to admit, this is the first e-mail I have sent to the group, but do
find it necessary to be educated and sometimes enjoy reading about what is
going on in the neighborhood around us.
 
I felt it my duty to alert the association about an ATTEMPTED break in
that occurred at our home.  We have an attached storage room in the back
of our home, with a separate entrance.  It has old paint, some wood, a cat
carrier and a few items of NO value!!  It seems a few night ago someone,
armed with a cordless drill, and obviously nothing better to do, tried to
no avail to drill all the way through the door and break the lock to get
what was inside.  Fortunately our lock and the door are stronger and they
did not get in, but we did not hear them either.

We have filed a police report and tried to block access to the rear of our
house, however, it still steams us!  We are now more aware of our home as
well as the neighborhood.  Hope this helps!!!

"*EMCA* citizens patrolT","Greetings all.  There was a pretty good turn-out last night but far
short of the 20+ I was expecting.  There were quite a few no-shows.  As
I said earlier, we need at least 20 to show the HPD that we are
serious.  Last night we had 14 attendees.

So I need to know:

if  you  still interested in doing this.

if someone would like to be in charge of the citizens' patrol.

If you weren't able to attend last night but are still motivated, how do
you suggest we transmit the introductory information to you?  A lot of
people did not make it and it will be impossible to find a day that's
convenient to everyone's schedule.  Maybe one of you who couldn't attend
the meeting would like to be responsible for providing the introductory
information to the others who couldn't be there but are still
interested.  This stuff is very basic and simple but you have to sign a
sheet showing you've heard it in order to get the training from HPD.

Last call, ya'll.  If it doesn't fly this time, maybe later.

Cheers,

Jaimie Evans

I was just perusing old e-mails, trying to find a letter from a friend in
France, and, uh, whoops,,, I just came across the note from you to please
announce in the newsletter your direction of the production of The Mikado.

Uh-oh... I'm so sorry.  The newsletter would have been good exposure for
you.  I can't believe I missed it... I usually try to read the EMCA e-mails
several times so I don't leave anything out.

Well, I goofed!  So sorry.

Now that the event is over, how about if you write a synopsis of how things
went, and I'll make SURE that it gets printed in the next newsletter?

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Re: *EMCA* Bomar/Morgan Drainage","The gutter and street bordering my property on Morgan between Welch and Drew
ponds water that has to evaporate away.
It is not a great deal of water and I considered it a nil prospect to get
the city to fix it.
If you all think that you might get it addressed without complicating or
jeopardizing your other concerns, I would be grateful.

"*EMCA* EMCA newsletter clarification","To Friends and Neighbors,

Bernice Dansby called me last night to point out a
correction/clarification of the information in the EMCA newsletter that
we provided on the upcoming primary elections.  First, the early voting
on February 23rd will be held at the Multi-Purpose Center on West Gray,
just west of Waugh.  The regular Democratic voting location will be at
Wharton Elementary School on March 12, however, she has not heard where
the Republican primary will be held.  She told me that sometimes they
are held in separate rooms at the school, but sometimes are in different
locations.  So please watch the newspaper for voting locations to ensure
that you go to the correct location for your Party's primary.

Subject: *EMCA* sign-up for EMCA Citizen Patrol


Thanks for your interest and response to the previous message about the
EMCA Citizen Patrol.  About 13 people have volunteered to participate so
far.  In order to make this a successful endeavor we need around 20
people to show up for the introductory meeting.  More would be better as
there is always a natural attrition rate.

If we as a neighborhood sincerely want something like the Citizen Patrol
to become a reality then we are going to require the participation of
more than the usual people who come out for everything.  This is a
commitment to the security of our neighborhood.  Thugs and scum don't
care if you rent or own, if you've paid your dues or not.  If you are
interested in making this happen then you need to arrange your schedule
and your priorities and step up to the plate.

If we don't get the 20 people we need at the introductory meeting then
the Citizen Patrol will be a no go until someone else decides to bring
it up again.

Those of you who are holding back, please give it some thought.

regards,

Jaimie Evans

"Cell phone","Now that Anthony is away most of the time, I wondered if you still use the
cell phone very often. If not, would you mind if I borrowed it for my trip,
or will it not work up here or enroute? I hate to buy one just for a road
trip, but maybe I should and then stop the service when I get back. Am also
thinking of buying some mace. Never considered it before, but if I had car
trouble, it could be helpful, or at least give me a sense of (false?)
security.

Pres is 50(!) today, and joins the rest of us elite ones.

"ALERT FOR LAPTOP USERS","
WARNING:  Laptop AC Adapter Recall Program

This recall and replacement program only affects AC adapters on laptop systems with the listed Model Series Number (second list below), not the notebook computers themselves.  We ask that all laptop users in the ETS environment check the number on their AC adapter, and notify us by return email if any of the three model series numbers appear just under the COMPAQ COMPUTER CORPORATION name.  We will centrally manage the replacement of your adapter to insure the replacement adapter is ordered and installed.

In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Compaq Computer Corporation announced a worldwide voluntary recall and replacement program for approximately 1.4 million AC adapters used with certain commercial notebook computer products.  Compaq customers affected by this recall and replacement program will be eligible to receive a replacement AC adapter for each recalled adapter.  These AC adapters were distributed worldwide in notebooks, as separate options, and as replacement spares for the following notebooks:
 
?          Armada M300
?          Armada 100s
?          Armada M700
?          Armada 110
?          Armada E500
?          Prosignia 170
?          Armada E500s
?          Prosignia 190
?          Armada V300
?          Notebook 100
?          Armada 3500
 
This recall and replacement program involves AC adapters made by only one of the multiple manufacturers used by Compaq; thus, not every notebook computer listed above will be affected by the recall.  The affected AC adapters can be identified by the adapter Model Series Number located directly under the Compaq Computer Corporation name on the AC adapter label.  
 
?          Model Series PPP003SD 
?          Model Series PPP003
?          Model Series PP2012

"Pooling points","Linda, Elizabeth posed a question to me asking if a firm contract can have pooling points with firm capacity.  My first inclination was that firm customers do not have pooling points with firm capacity on their firm contracts, but this is not to say that they cannot request to move to a pooling point and release from that point (I verified with Teb Lokey).  In our current contract system, there is not a validation stopping the user from inputting a pool point as a firm point on a contract, however, according to Elizabeth, she did get an error message when initiating a capacity release transaction from a pooling point (for testing).  So, what I think needs to happen, is that we allow pooling points to have firm capacity on both the contract and capacity release systems.  I do not believe this to be a high priority with implementation, but should however, be put in place with TW's implementation.  nb

"FW: Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR","As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday.  Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning.  Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Subject:	Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :


1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to ""implement"" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.


On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with ""SoCal backbone
facilities"". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.


Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work ""relatively well"" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)


I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Mark, IGS.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"RE: F.P.U. NEW SMYRNA DELIVERY POINT QUESTION","The way the dpoa is set up now is the way it would be reflected if the two contracts were combined.  However, if the contracts are combined, does that mean that we would make the point a division?  If so, the problem is solved, otherwise, we're back to the same issue.  nb

I agree with Teb.
The ""book-out"" is GTC Section 14.A.

Not sure what you mean by ""Balancing Entities"".
The same DPOA covers both contracts.
But, there are two contracts.
And, the two contracts are accounted for separately.
Each contract must be ""balanced"".
(Whether covered by one DPOA or two DPOAs.)
Is that what you mean?

Since FPU holds two FTS-1 contracts (according to Nancy), 
we could probably combine them (if FPU wants top do that).
Jim says that we did that for Peoples.
We would have to check and see if there was any reason not to combine.
If they were combined, then there would be balancing under one contract.

He can net imbalances together by ""booking out"" the imbalance of one entity with the imbalance of the other entity.  In other words,  do a book-out with himself.  This can be done without adding the single point as a division to an existing divisional contract.

Importance:	High


	I spoke with Chris Snyder this morning and his request is to add New Smyrna as a 4th Division to his existing 3 Divisions in order to have one Balancing Entity  vs.. Two Balancing Entities so he can net imbalances together. He is not looking for section 11 rights and he knows the New Smyrna lateral is constrained and he can not move any additional volumes there. Chris right now will have to deal with Two Balancing Entities and this is what he is trying to avoid. He will do what ever it takes on his end that we require/request. Please take another look with the one reason (Balancing) in mind. Give me your feedback. Thanks... John.

"RE: *EMCA* Response from Reliant - HL&P","Ed,
Great job at actually getting something (almost) in writing from HL&P!

The big poles are just not suitable for neighborhood use, simply too big.  I
am, therefore, selfishly relieved that they are not continuing along my
street.  With all the townhome development, plus these mega-poles, what else
can be done to destroy the traditional appearance of our area?  Maybe
they'll put an environmentally sensitive second deck 20' above Montrose to
bypass the ailing downtown highways?

The attached explanation does however beg the question why there's one of
the new pole holes been dug on the NE corner of Peden and Montrose, when the
line runs down the west side of Montrose Blvd. and then west on Peden.

Subject: *EMCA* Response from Reliant - HL&P


Neartown neighbors,

The attachment is a response to my information request concerning Reliant -
HL&P's installation of the big poles. Conversations after my letter's
receipt moved in the direction of possible community meetings where R-H
would explain what they were doing and answer our many questions.

Last Tuesday R-H informed me that since the installation project would be
completed by the end of this month, that the attachment would be sufficient
for their communication purposes. A meeting with us was not necessary.

The R-H spokesperson readily admitted that there had been no attempts to
obtain community imput/feedback prior the new pole installation.

I'm disappointed and frustrated. I need your thoughts on how to proceed.

Read the attachment and tell me what you think should happen next.

Thanks

BTW, thanks to Carmen Druke for taking the time to go!
 
Amy Barnes
 
**********************

Community members,
 
Today (Thursday) the Planning Commission held a public hearing on the Prevailing Lot Size Amendment.  
 
The meeting started at 2:30pm and many, many, many agenda items later, just after 6pm(!), it was our turn to step up & speak in favor of the amendment. Talk we did, and I believe we had a good impact. 
 
Thanks to last year's NTA president & Chapter 42 expert, Jack Rose and past east Montrose president, Carmen Druke for being there for NTA.
 
Also there was Jane Cahill & Billie Mercer from Old Sixth Ward, Theo Fabio and Evalyn Krudy for University Place and BOCA and the president of Southampton CA (didn't get his name). 
 
There were folks there, too, from the Heights, making an altogether well rounded representation of the vitality of the inner-loop. 
 
There's no decision yet from the commission and we'll be watching for that. It was a long grim wait, but it what you have do to gain those little bits that add up to self determination for our neighborhoods and protection and preservation of our communities.
 
Thanks to everyone that make the effort today.

I have agreed to organize EMCA's first annual Easter Egg Hunt, and am hoping that I can look to the egroup to get some volunteers and ideas.

The Hunt will be held at the pocket park in the 700 block of Bomar, on Saturday, March 23, from 9:00 to 10:30 in the morning.  All children accompanies by an EMCA resident will be welcome to participate.  

I don't know how many interested parents/children we will have, as this is our first year; we will use the newsletter to advertise the Hunt to the neighborhood, so that we can try to be sure to have enough goodies ready.

In the meantime, if anyone is up for volunteering time and help, I would love to hear from you.

"*EMCA* Reliant-HL&P, it ain't over","Neartown neighbors,

This thing w/ Reliant-HL&P (R-H) is not over. Right now I'm talking w/ various officeholders w/ this approach....if R-H has permits and plan approval from all levels of government, how come you didn't tell me/us about what they were going to do in Montrose?

What is this 10 year plan I keep hearing about? What do you know about the plan and how does that impact Montrose?

Expecing answers next week and a response to staging a meeting w/ all of us and R-H to respond to our direct questions. 

Also asked DDanberg to do w/ R-H what she did w/ TX Dept of Transportation and the SW Freeway and the bridges. Bring us all together in one room. Not w/ p.r. people but w/ decision makers.

Need one, maybe two committed volunteers to comunicate w/ R-H and the politicians. Someone(s) I can appoint to a task force on this issue. Maybe a liitle face time, mostly lots of phone and fax work. Need well mannered persistance to contrast my crabby aggression. That's worked w/ other issues.

Call, e-mail to discuss if you would like to step up to this.

"ETS Pipeline Integrity Program Management - Organizational Changes","The purpose of this memo is to inform you of organizational changes for ETS Pipeline Integrity Program Management.

Frank Osburn, Director of Facility and Operational Records, will move from Engineering and Construction to the Pipeline Integrity organization. Frank will bring the Document Control Team, the Mapping Team, and the Project Completion Team, as well as be responsible for Operational Compliance (Meagan Bange) and the PHD / PDMS group under Larry Abbott. We believe this entire group is critical to Pipeline Safety and Integrity and will help ensure consistent strategies.

Max Brown, currently Director of Corrosion and Risk Management, will add Pipeline Integrity Program responsibilities to his role. Max will add Ronny Davenport, Mike Ames, and John Millar to his Corrosion / Pipeline Integrity organization. This group will be working closely with the ETS Area VP's and Region Directors to ensure our Pipeline Integrity initiatives are communicated and on track. 

David Johnson will continue in the critical role as VP of Pipeline Safety, with Michael Crump as Director. The Pipeline Safety group will consist of Merlin Moseman, Pat Vaughan, and Lisa Choquette (RPT), with two Pipeline Safety Engineer vacancies currently open and posted.

At 1:00 p.m., the Win2000 team migrated the reverse lookup zones from the OTS domain to Corp.  This change included the gas control segment of 155.251.16.0.  During this change the DNS name space for OTS was also migrated to the Corporate domain.  No impact is expected.  However, if you feel you are experiencing problems that may be related to DNS name resolution, please contact Mary Vollmer at 713-709-9414.

Oct. 10		
From 7:00 - 9:00 p.m., the Telephony team will with test the UDP tables in the PBX.  The only possible disruption could be an ECS user calling numbers in the Enron building that may roll directly to voicemail, rather than ring on the persons set.  Minimal impact is expected..
Oct. 10	
From 10:00 - 11:45 p.m., the Server team will Install windows scripting host and reboot the EES Notes servers.  No impact to ETS users is expected.

Freezing out employee options during this period is probably the best way to further demoralize the workforce.  Are the benefits to Enron (and its related parties) worth the increased employee distrust of management that will result from this action?

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

State senator Ellis, State representatives Danberg, Coleman and Farrar see the need and without our help, it will not happen.  

C.. 2..Task Force Formation: Meet Your Elected Official Event 2003. To avoid last minute hassles, to maximize the potential of this important event and to add real depth and fun to it, a few volunteers are needed to make this happen next January.

D...Crime in the 'hood. What's it like in your area? Have heard really scary things from Park Civic and other areas. East Montrose is responding by organizing a Citizens on Patrol. Why the increase in crime?  What can we do about this w/ HPD?

"RE: *EMCA* Response from Reliant - HL&P","1.  Are the questions those actually posed by someone outside Reliant, or
are they the sort of questions that PR departments typically compose in
order to emphasize the points THEY want to make?

2.  The response talks about the cost-effectiveness of poles vs.
underground.  It does not address the rumor about the lines going
underground at North and South Blvd.  Was any question about the rumor even
asked?  Is the North/South Blvd. routing part of the same overall
improvement effort?

3.  Even though there was the implication that community input is not needed
for a project that will finish shortly, what about community input on (or,
at least, some better public dissemination of information about) the 10-year
plan mentioned in the email message of 3/4?

And, while we're on the subject of utility infrastructure ...

What can we learn about plans of Southwestern Bell to upgrade the phone
lines, particulary in EMCA?  Every single technician I talk to confirms that
the equipment in what used to be the JAckson exchange (52_) is among the
oldest (if not THE oldest) in the city.  Heavy rain brings on static and
outages.  The lines are so decrepit that a technician attempting to repair
service to one address can accidentally disrupt service to a different
address.  It's gotten so that whenever I see a technician on my street, I
make it a point to go out, nicely mention that I'm aware of this history,
and ask them to doublecheck the lines into my home while they're up there on
their ladders.  Technicians also confirm that the work rules being imposed
upon them require them to move quickly from ticket to ticket, often forcing
them to perform only the most cursory of repairs and not solve the deeper
problems inherent in such aged equipment.

SWB has to be feeling the impact of all the growth in this area, not unlike
Reliant.  It would be nice to know what they're doing to accommodate it?

"RE: Pooling points","We believe the reason why we received an 'Invalid Point for This Rate Schedule' validation message during the capacity release award process was due to the fact that pool point (POI 25309/DRN 716) is a Western Division point trying to added as a primary point on an FTS-2 contract.  The validation did not occur when the contract was created because this point was designated as a valid associated point behind a division.  

Can a western division point be set up as an associated point behind a market division?  If so, can the releasing shipper be allowed to release the associated point, which will then become the acquiring shipper's primary point on an FTS-2 contract?

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Cc:	Brown, Elizabeth; Lokey, Teb
Subject:	Pooling points
Importance:	High

Linda, Elizabeth posed a question to me asking if a firm contract can have pooling points with firm capacity.  My first inclination was that firm customers do not have pooling points with firm capacity on their firm contracts, but this is not to say that they cannot request to move to a pooling point and release from that point (I verified with Teb Lokey).  In our current contract system, there is not a validation stopping the user from inputting a pool point as a firm point on a contract, however, according to Elizabeth, she did get an error message when initiating a capacity release transaction from a pooling point (for testing).  So, what I think needs to happen, is that we allow pooling points to have firm capacity on both the contract and capacity release systems.  I do not believe this to be a high priority with implementation, but should however, be put in place with TW's implementation.  nb

"*EMCA* Fw: This Thursday at the Planning Commission","Thought that this may be of interest to EMCA residents:
 

 
Community Leaders & Members,
 
This year's significant city action impacting our area is the Prevailing Lot Size Amendment.
 
A Planning Commission Public Hearing will be held this Thursday (tomorrow) at 2:30pm at the City Hall Annex Council Chambers, 900 Bagby. The building behind & west of City Hall. (City Hall is the building w/ the clock and the long pond/pool in front)  
 
This is the City's response to our need for protection and preservation of neighborhood integrity and allow the option for self determination by areas within communities. It is important for all of the Neartown/Montrose area
 
What's this about? The long answer....Scroll down to the Proposed Prevailing Lot Size Amendment at www.ci.houston.tx.us/departme/planning/Devp_rel.htm <http://www.ci.houston.tx.us/departme/planning/Devp_rel.htm>.
 
The short answer....residents on both sides of a block can petition the City to establish a ""prevailing lot size"", thereby inhibiting, if not discouraging, new development from reducing or subdividing a single lot to less than the established lot size. 
 
For instance, if the established lot size for a particular block is 50 ft x 100 ft, a townhouse builder could not buy a lot within that block to replat/subdivide the lot into two 25 ft x 100 ft lot for a townhouse on each lot.
 
Yes, there's lots of details, and like the existing protection on establishing front building setback lines, this prevailing Lot Size Amendment can help to maintain neighborhood integrity in areas without deed restrictions and in deed restricted areas that do not address established lot sizes.
 
I need your presence tomorrow to show the community support for this proposal. If this doesn't get out of the Planning Commission, it'll never get to City Council to become an ordinance amendment. This is that part of the process where we need to be there to fill the room.

"Re: *EMCA* Another breakin","To add to the list, there was another break-in this morning (mid-morning)
while the owners were out to breakfast.  Someone used a crowbar to pry open
the garage and a lawn mower and several other things were taken.  The address
is in the 2300 block of Mason, but the access was from a driveway in the 200
block of Fargo.  The incident has been reported to the police.

Not too long after that, two officers came by my house to follow up on some
complaints that I turned in last week.  The urged me to tell everyone that
the more calls and complaints that are filed in our neighborhood, the more
justification they will have to bring more officers into the area to work the
problems.  They need the evidence to show that our problems are growing.  So
keep those phone calls and blue forms coming In!

If you need more forms, I have some (303 Fargo) and also you can get them at
the Storefront.  I will also bring them with me to the next meeting.

"*EMCA* Neartown Little League this Sat morning","Neartown neighbors,

This Saturday morning, march 23rd, is Opening Game day for the Neartown Little League at Dunlavy Park. (Dunlavy at the SW Freeway)

The morning begins with a parade on Firetrucks at 8:30am from Fiesta's parking lot (W. Alabama & Dunlavy) south on Dunlavy to the Park.

At the park the Opening game ceremony will include City Council members, national Little league officials and the news media.

The NLL continues to grow (now at 121 kids), with a new batting cage in a refurbished ball field as part of a long term program for community kids.

II you have kids and have been thinking about little league, its a good opportunity to see this program in action.

With or without kids, it's a fun way to spend an hour or so watching what your neighbors have worked hard to provide all kids in the neighborhoods of our communities.

For questions or information...(never too late to sign your kids up...), call me.

Thanks

"*EMCA* Response from Reliant - HL&P","Neartown neighbors,

The attachment is a response to my information request concerning Reliant -
HL&P's installation of the big poles. Conversations after my letter's
receipt moved in the direction of possible community meetings where R-H
would explain what they were doing and answer our many questions.

Last Tuesday R-H informed me that since the installation project would be
completed by the end of this month, that the attachment would be sufficient
for their communication purposes. A meeting with us was not necessary.

The R-H spokesperson readily admitted that there had been no attempts to
obtain community imput/feedback prior the new pole installation.

I'm disappointed and frustrated. I need your thoughts on how to proceed.

Read the attachment and tell me what you think should happen next.

"Re: *EMCA* Graffiti spotting","Well Kids i'm back.
It seems that a sub-contractor had an illegal city of Houston sign placed
on the job site and did't get a permit to cut up new pavement. So as it
stands the subcontractor will  have to pave the entire block. Watch the
10pm chan.  11 news.
One e-mail and all this. Stay active folks.

"Nursing Home","
A little old lady was going up and down the halls in a nursing home. 
As she walked, she would flip up the hem of her nightgown and say,
""Super Sex! Super Sex!"" 

She walked up to an elderly man in a wheelchair. She flipped her 
gown in front of him and said ""Super sex""! 

He sat silently for a moment or two looking up at her. 
Then he finally answered, ""I'll take the soup.""

"Re: *EMCA* sign-up for EMCA Citizen Patrol","
 I will participate. Just tell me when and where to show up.
Chris Collins, 906 Bomar, 713.449.9350
  Jaimie Evans <evanscj@swbell.net> wrote: Thanks for your interest and response to the previous message about the
EMCA Citizen Patrol.  About 13 people have volunteered to participate so
far.  In order to make this a successful endeavor we need around 20
people to show up for the introductory meeting.  More would be better as
there is always a natural attrition rate.

If we as a neighborhood sincerely want something like the Citizen Patrol
to become a reality then we are going to require the participation of
more than the usual people who come out for everything.  This is a
commitment to the security of our neighborhood.  Thugs and scum don't
care if you rent or own, if you've paid your dues or not.  If you are
interested in making this happen then you need to arrange your schedule
and your priorities and step up to the plate.

If we don't get the 20 people we need at the introductory meeting then
the Citizen Patrol will be a no go until someone else decides to bring
it up again.

Those of you who are holding back, please give it some thought.

regards,

Jaimie Evans

"*EMCA* Fw:   Danburg's new district","FYI:


Neartown Neighbors,

Received today a nice color map of State Representative Debra Danburg's new district (#134) in response to my asking her office, what are the street boundaries.

Neartown is divided, north and south by Montrose Blvd.in the following manner:   From Allen Parkway, south on Montrose Blvd to Sul Ross. At Sul Ross, the boundary is the west side of Precinct # 0123. A five x seven block dog-leg to the Southwest Fwy.

West of Montrose Blvd, you are in Danburg's new district #134. East of Montrose, you are in State Representative Garnet Coleman's district #147.  

Danburg is definitely running for re-election, in a district that now includes all of River Oaks, Memorial Park, Bellaire, West U., and the medical center. 

She's been in office for 20 years (number 10 in seniority!), and I'm told that this is her first time to face genuine opponents (there are at least four) since she first took the oath of office.

As it happens, as a member of the Houston Association of Realtor's Political Action Committee, I'm part of the screening committee interviewing state and congressional candidates all of this week in preparation for the March primaries.

You should know, too, that Neartown/Montrose resident, Realtor and past Cherryhurst CA president, Jeff Kuchar, is also a Realtor PAC member involved in the interviews. 

To those folks that communicated to me a desire to sue, protest or to do something about the redistricting, about NTA being cut in half...it's over. The entire state is reacting to the federal court's decision by getting down to business. It's a new era for state legislative elections.

I'll let you know when I learn more.

Thanks,

Ed Gonzales

  I just took some pictures of Lake Bomar using old fashioned film which we
probably won't develop for weeks. If someone has a digital camera and could
e-mail me a couple of pictures, I could print them and take them to Ada
Edwards' office Monday.

"Re: *EMCA* Streets & curbs","Thrilled as I am that Welch Street is all shiny and new, the
City Public Works Department is in a complete state of
emergency, as near as I can tell.  Nothing short of a new
Council, Mayor, and Management are likely to improve
matters.  The current political group seems to spend most of
their energy building new (unmaintainable) public works
monuments (stadiums, trains) or on various ""soft"" HR issues.
 Meanwhile, our city is crumbling around our ears - what
Scott Long calls ""the necrotization of the inner city""!! 
Let's have someone from P.W. Dept come to the EMCA meeting
each month and lay out their plan for Montrose for us
(water, sewer, streets, etc).  I might even cut class early
to make it.

Love,

Ben

"Questar Southern Trails Due Diligence","
The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.

"ETS and Corporate Change Control","
The following item was presented in this week's corporate change control....
Jan. 3	
	From 6:00 - 6:30 p.m., the Corporate server team will move cluster notes nahou-us06 and nahou-us07.  These two nodes will be evicted out of 		there respective clusters and recreated as an application cluster.  No impact is expected.
Jan. 4
		From 3:00 - 4:00 p.m., the Win2000 team will decommission DFS Server NAHOUTRD to replace existing the DFS NAHOU cluster marked for 		Netco.  No impact to ETS users is expected.
Jan. 5
		From 2:00 - 3:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will split the sysAdmiral Fault Tolerance Databases and Master Services on 				NAHOU-BPMS01P and NAHOU-BPMSFT01P. The NAHOU-BPMS01P Database/Master will be used for Estate Scheduling needs and 			NAHOU-BPMSFT01P will be used for Netco Scheduling Needs. The servers may have to be rebooted during this change but no impact to the 		sysAdmiral application is expected.  After the environments are split there will be no more replication between the two servers or Fault Jan. 		Tolerance.  
Jan. 7		
		From 7:00 a.m. through 1/11 at 5:00 p.m., Facilities will perform the annual maintenance on the rooftop chillers.  The chillers will be taken 		down one at a time during the maintenance.  No impact to ETS is expected.

"The Downtown Club - March 18","The Downtown Club E-News Note...bringing you the latest news and event
information from your Club.

To those of you who received multiple e-mails last week, I am truly sorry.
Our listserve was having some serious issues which have now been resolved.
For those who have requested that their addresses be removed from our list;
because the server was down last week it has taken a few days longer to
register any changes.  These changes will be made before the next e-mail.
Thank you for your patience.   -Jennifer

For those who are new to the list, this is an e-mail update sent every week
to give you the highlights of Club happenings as well as to give you a
positive boost for the week!

DTC at Plaza Security
The security procedures for guests and tenants will cease as of this week.
The roping will remain at both entrances to encourage everyone to walk by
an HPD officer, but no ID will be required.  The exception will be at the
loading dock.  If you are entering the building at the dock, with or
without cargo, you will be asked for your driver's license.

This Week:
Guest Chef Dinner - Friday, March 22nd
Hors D'ouevres - 6:30 p.m., Dinner - 7:30 p.m.
ClubCorp has a wealth of the world's finest chefs to satisfy the
sophisticated palates of our Members.  Come to The Downtown Club at Plaza
to meet the best of the best:
Chef Doug George from DTC at Plaza graduated first in his class from The
Culinary Institiute of America in Hyde Park, New York.  He has earned
several awards and continually sets the standards for menu concepts and
food artistry.
Chef Russell Knott from DTC at Houston Center has shared his passion for
cooking with such establishments as Brennan's, Commander's Palace, and Mr.

Greetings from your Member Relations Director
I hope everyone had as great a weekend as I did.  My dad was visiting from
Oklahoma, so I got to do many of the tourist things that I haven't gotten
around to doing since my move here last August.  Because my dad was a
military man, he always enjoys visiting the local memorials and museums.
It's always a treat having my own personal guide, and not many people have
such extensive knowledge of airplanes, ships, history and of course,
personal stories.  We toured the Flight Museum in Galveston, The USS Texas
in LaPorte and then, as the grand finale, we saw ""We Were Soldiers"".  If
you haven't seen this movie yet, you must go.  It was incredible.

Have a wonderful week!

See you at the Club,
Jennifer K. Mangini

"FW: ETS and  Corporate Change Control","The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Feb 27
From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will block all ICMP messages from all Internet routers.  These changes will be made on the Houston, Ardmore EIN, and Omaha Internet routers.  No impact is expected.

Feb. 27
From 9:00 - 10:00 p.m., the Messaging team will upgrade Nahou-MSBES01P, Nahou-MSBES02P and Nahou-MSBES03P to SP2 and apply a hotfix.  This change will result in a five minute delay sending and receiving Blackberry messages.

Feb 28
From 7:00 p.m. through 3/1 at 1:00 a.m., the Unix team will upgrade the ftp.enron.com server from existing Ultar2 to E450 as well as upgrade ftp to Proftp ver. 1.2. This maintenance will result in a total outage of the ftp.enron.com site.  The old sites moby.enron.com and sparky.enron.com will no longer exist after this change.  Support staff should ensure jobs going to the enron ftp server use ftp.enron.com.  Any questions about this maintenance, contact me at 713-853-3381 or 713-859-6676.

Mar. 6
At 12:00 p.m., the Gas Measurement team will decommission the MIPS server (IP address 192.168.175.62).

"Making Strides Against Breast Cancer","Hi, Tebby:
Had a great 5-mile walk today, accompanied by two women from Hancock. One of 
them--Martha Wilder--is the daughter of the elderly man whose father AND 
grandfather were born in my house!! Just learned the latter part today. 
Martha brought over the Hancock Town History and some photos of her father, 
grandfather, and great-grandfather.

I didn't realize that I was supposed to have had checks to hand over to the 
American Cancer Society today, so I'm mailing them a check. I raised $200 
(most of it from me as I started adding names to the list--Daddy's and 
Sheryl's.) Didn't want to bother Daddy with this as I don't think he would 
have understood what I was doing and Sheryl is still pretty stressed out over 
Candice, but their names are on the sheet, along with yours, Mother's, 
Preston's, Annie Baxter's, and mine. So what I'm asking people to do is 
simply send me their check, made out to me. Apparently, $200 was a big number 
as I was given a sweatshirt! It was a great way to spend part of the day and 
I hope to do this again next year.

Hope you had an enjoyable weekend. And thanks for your $25 contribution!
Love,
Sandy

Subject: *EMCA* EMCA's First Annual Easter Egg Hunt


Neighbors:

I have agreed to organize EMCA's first annual Easter Egg Hunt, and am hoping that I can look to the egroup to get some volunteers and ideas.

The Hunt will be held at the pocket park in the 700 block of Bomar, on Saturday, March 23, from 9:00 to 10:30 in the morning.  All children accompanies by an EMCA resident will be welcome to participate.  

I don't know how many interested parents/children we will have, as this is our first year; we will use the newsletter to advertise the Hunt to the neighborhood, so that we can try to be sure to have enough goodies ready.

In the meantime, if anyone is up for volunteering time and help, I would love to hear from you.

"*EMCA* sign-up for EMCA Citizen Patrol","Thanks for your interest and response to the previous message about the
EMCA Citizen Patrol.  About 13 people have volunteered to participate so
far.  In order to make this a successful endeavor we need around 20
people to show up for the introductory meeting.  More would be better as
there is always a natural attrition rate.

If we as a neighborhood sincerely want something like the Citizen Patrol
to become a reality then we are going to require the participation of
more than the usual people who come out for everything.  This is a
commitment to the security of our neighborhood.  Thugs and scum don't
care if you rent or own, if you've paid your dues or not.  If you are
interested in making this happen then you need to arrange your schedule
and your priorities and step up to the plate.

If we don't get the 20 people we need at the introductory meeting then
the Citizen Patrol will be a no go until someone else decides to bring
it up again.

Those of you who are holding back, please give it some thought.

regards,

Jaimie Evans

"Southern Trails letter of interest","
Attached is a NON BINDING letter of interest to Questar for their Southern Trail Pipeline - west leg.  This is their crude pipeline that was purchased with the intention of converting it to a natural gas line but apparently, their interests have changed.  The west leg runs from near the California border to Long Beach.

The importance of this non binding bid is to get us into the data room so that we can really take a close look and gather information to see how interested we really are in this pipe.

Please let me know if you have any comments.  This letter has gone through legal and will be faxed to Questar today. 


 

Thanks,

Mark

He can net imbalances together by ""booking out"" the imbalance of one entity with the imbalance of the other entity.  In other words,  do a book-out with himself.  This can be done without adding the single point as a division to an existing divisional contract.

Importance:	High


	I spoke with Chris Snyder this morning and his request is to add New Smyrna as a 4th Division to his existing 3 Divisions in order to have one Balancing Entity  vs.. Two Balancing Entities so he can net imbalances together. He is not looking for section 11 rights and he knows the New Smyrna lateral is constrained and he can not move any additional volumes there. Chris right now will have to deal with Two Balancing Entities and this is what he is trying to avoid. He will do what ever it takes on his end that we require/request. Please take another look with the one reason (Balancing) in mind. Give me your feedback. Thanks... John.

Thanks for your interest and response to the previous message about the
EMCA Citizen Patrol.  About 13 people have volunteered to participate so
far.  In order to make this a successful endeavor we need around 20
people to show up for the introductory meeting.  More would be better as
there is always a natural attrition rate.

If we as a neighborhood sincerely want something like the Citizen Patrol
to become a reality then we are going to require the participation of
more than the usual people who come out for everything.  This is a
commitment to the security of our neighborhood.  Thugs and scum don't
care if you rent or own, if you've paid your dues or not.  If you are
interested in making this happen then you need to arrange your schedule
and your priorities and step up to the plate.

If we don't get the 20 people we need at the introductory meeting then
the Citizen Patrol will be a no go until someone else decides to bring
it up again.

Those of you who are holding back, please give it some thought.

regards,

Jaimie Evans

Hi Sandy,  

I am passing this on to friends..   Joan

Stan Goff is a former U.S. Special Forces Master Sergeant.  He has been
listed as an enemy of America for daring to question what Americans have
been told about the World Trade attack and for participating in a teach-in
at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on the 17 of September.  Here is his own
words, ""the domestic repression has already begun, officially and
unofficially. It's kind of a latter day McCarthyism. I participated in a
teach-in at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on the 17th of September, and
though not a single person on the panel excused or justified the attacks,
and every person there offered either condolences and prayers for the
victims, we were excoriated within two days as ""enemies of America.""
Yesterday an op-ed called for my deportation (to where, one can only guess).
Now Herr Ashcroft is fast tracking the biggest abrogation of US civil
liberties since the so-called anti-terrorism legislation after the Oklahoma
City bombing."" 

What they are doing is very, very dangerous
by Stan Goff 

I'm a retired Special Forces Master Sergeant. That doesn't cut much for
those who will only accept the opinions of former officers on military
matters, since we enlisted swine are assumed to be incapable of grasping the
nuances of doctrine.

But I wasn't just in the army, I studied and taught military science and
doctrine. I was a tactics instructor at the Jungle Operations Training
Center in Panama, and I taught Military Science at West Point. And contrary
to the popular image of what Special Forces does, SF's mission is to teach.
We offer advice and assistance to foreign forces. That's everything from
teaching marksmanship to a private to instructing a Battalion staff on how
to coordinate effective air operations with a sister service.

Based on that experience, and operations in eight designated conflict areas
from Vietnam to Haiti, I have to say that the story we hear on the news and
read in the newspapers is simply not believable. The most cursory glance at
the verifiable facts, before, during, and after September 11th, does not
support the official line or conform to the current actions of the United
States government. 

But the official line only works if they can get everyone to accept its
underlying premises. I'm not at all surprised about the Republican and
Democratic Parties repeating these premises. They are simply two factions
within a single dominant political class, and both are financed by the same
economic powerhouses. My biggest disappointment, as someone who identifies
himself with the left, has been the tacit acceptance of those premises by
others on the left, sometimes naively, and sometimes to score some morality
points. Those premises are twofold. One, there is the premise that what this
de facto administration is doing now is a ""response"" to September 11th. Two,
there is the premise that this attack on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon was done by people based in Afghanistan. In my opinion, neither of
these is sound. 

To put this in perspective we have to go back not to September 11th, but to
last year or further.

A man of limited intelligence, George W. Bush, with nothing more than his
name and the behind-the-scenes pressure of his powerful father-a former
President, ex-director of Central Intelligence, and an oil man-is
systematically constructed as a candidate, at tremendous cost. Across the
country, subtle and not-so-subtle mechanisms are put into place to
disfranchise a significant fraction of the Democrat's African-American voter
base. This doesn't come out until Florida becomes a battleground for
Electoral College votes, and the magnitude of the story has been suppressed
by the corporate media to this day. In a decision so lacking in legitimacy,
the Supreme Court will neither by-line the author of the decision nor allow
the decision to ever be used as a precedent, Bush v. Gore awards the
presidency of the United States to a man who loses the popular vote in
Florida and loses the national popular vote by over 600,000.

This de facto regime then organizes a very interesting cabinet. The Vice
President is an oil executive and the former Secretary of Defense. The
National Security Advisor is a director on the board of a transnational oil
corporation and a Russia scholar. The Secretary of State is a man with no
diplomatic experience whatsoever, and the former Chair of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff. The other interesting appointment is Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary
of Defense. Rumsfeld is the former CEO of Searle Pharmaceuticals. He and
Cheney were featured as speakers at the May, 2000, Russian-American Business
Leaders Forum. So the consistent currents in this cabinet are petroleum, the
former Soviet Union, and the military.

Based on the record of Daddy Bush, in all his guises, and the general
trajectory of US foreign policy as far back as the Carter Administration, I
feel I can reasonably conclude that Middle Eastern and South Asian fossil
fuels are one of their major preoccupations. Not just because this klavern
has some very direct financial interests in fossil fuel, but because they
surely know that worldwide oil production is peaking as we speak, and will
soon begin a permanent and precipitous decline that will completely change
the character of civilization as we know it within 20 years. Even the left
seems to be in deep denial about this, but the math is available. And, no,
alternative energies and energy technologies will not save us. All the
alternatives in the world can not begin to provide more than a tiny fraction
of the energy base now provided by oil. This makes it more than a resource,
and the drive to control what's left more than an economic competition.

I further conclude that the economic colonization of the former Soviet Union
is probably high on that agenda, and in fact has a powerful synergy with the
issue of petroleum. Russia not only holds vast untapped resources that
beckon to imperialism in crisis, it remains a credible military and nuclear
challenger in the region.

We have not one, but three members of the Bush de facto cabinet with
military credentials, which makes the cabinet look quite a lot like a
military General Staff. All this way before September 11th.

Then there's the subject of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO
might have expected consignment to the dustbin of the Cold War after the
Eastern Bloc shattered in 1991. Peace dividend and all that. But it didn't.
It expanded directly into the former states of the Eastern Bloc toward the
former Soviet Union, and contributed significant forces to the devastation
of Iraq-a key country in the world oil market, over which control translates
into the ability to manipulate oil prices.

NATO is a military formation, and the United States exerts the controlling
interest in it. It seemed like a form without a function, but it remedied
that pretty quickly.

Then when Yugoslavia refused to play ball with the International Monetary
Fund, the US and Germany began a systematic campaign of destabilization
there, even using some of the veterans of Afghanistan in that campaign. NATO
became the military arm of that agenda-the break-up of Yugoslavia into
compliant statelets, the further containment of the former Soviet Union, and
the future pipeline easement for Caspain Sea oil to Western European markets
through Kosovo. 

You see, this is important to understand, and people-even those against the
war talk-are tending to overlook the significance of it. NATO is not a
guarantor of international law, and it is not a humanitarian organization.
It is a military alliance with one very dominant partner. And it can no
longer claim to be a defensive alliance against European socialists. It is
an instrument of military aggression.

NATO is the organization that is now going to thrust further along the 40th
parallel from the Balkans through the Southern Asian Republics of the former
Soviet Union. The US military has already taken control of a base in
Uzbekistan. No one is talking about how what we are doing seems to be a very
logical extension of a strategy that was already in motion, and has been in
motion for two decades. Once we recognize the pattern of activity designed
to simultaneously consolidate control over Middle Eastern and South Asian
oil, and contain and colonize the former Soviet Union, Afghanistan is
exactly where they need to go to pursue that agenda.

Afghanistan borders Iran, India, and even China but, more importantly, the
Central Asian Republics of the former Soviet Union, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan
and Tajikistan. These border Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan borders Russia.
Turkmenistan sits on the Southeastern quadrant of the Caspian Sea, whose oil
the Bush Administration dearly covets. Afghanistan is necessary for two
things: as a base of operations to begin the process of destabilizing,
breaking off, and establishing control over the South Asian Republics, which
will begin within the next 18-24 months in my opinion, and constructing a
pipeline through Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan to deliver
petroleum to the Asian market.

The BBC was recently told by Niaz Naik, a Pakistani Foreign Secretary, that
senior American officials were warning them as early as mid-July that
military action for mid-October was being planned for Afghanistan. In 1996,
the Department of Energy was issuing reports on the desirability of a
pipeline through Afghanistan, and in 1998, Unocal testified before the House
Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific that this pipeline was crucial to
transport Caspian Basin oil to the Indian Ocean.

Given this evidence that a military operation to secure at least a portion
of Afghanistan has been on the table, possibly as early as five years ago, I
can't help but conclude that the actions we are seeing put into motion now
are part of a pre-September 11th agenda. I'm absolutely sure of that, in
fact. The planning alone for operations, of this scale, that are now taking
shape, would take many months. And we are seeing them take shape in mere
weeks. 

It defies common sense. This administration is lying about this whole thing
being a ""reaction"" to September 11th. That leads me, in short order, to be
very suspicious of their yet-to-be-provided evidence that someone in
Afghanistan is responsible. It's just too damn convenient. Which also leads
me to wonder-just for the sake of knowing-what actually did happen on
September 11th, and who actually is responsible.

The so-called evidence is a farce. The US presented Tony Blair's puppet
government with the evidence, and of the 70 so-called points of evidence,
only nine even referred to the attacks on the World Trade Center, and those
points were conjectural. This is a bullshit story from beginning to end.
Presented with the available facts, any 16-year old with a liking for
courtroom dramas could tear this story apart like a two-dollar shirt. But
our corporate press regurgitates it uncritically. But then, as we should
know by now, their role is to legitimize.

This cartoon heavy they've turned bin Laden into makes no sense, when you
begin to appreciate the complexity and synchronicity of the attacks. As a
former military person who's been involved in the development of countless
operations orders over the years, I can tell you that this was a very
sophisticated and costly enterprise that would have left what we call a huge
""signature"". 

In other words, it would be very hard to effectively conceal.

So there's a real question about why there was no warning of this. That can
be a question about the efficacy of the government's intelligence apparatus.
That can be a question about various policies in the various agencies that
had to be duped to orchestrate this action. And it can also be a question
about whether or not there was foreknowledge of the event, and that
foreknowledge is being covered up. To dismiss this concern out of hand as
the rantings of conspiracy nuts is premature. And there is a history of this
kind of thing being done by national political bosses, including the darling
of liberals, Franklin Roosevelt. The evidence is very compelling that the
Roosevelt Administration deliberately failed to act to stop Pearl Harbor in
order to mobilize enough national anger to enter the World War II.

I have no idea why people aren't asking some very specific questions about
the actions of Bush and company on the day of the attacks. Follow along:

Four planes get hijacked and deviate from their flight plans, all the while
on FAA radar. The planes are all hijacked between 7:45 and 8:10 AM Eastern
Daylight Time. 

Who is notified? 

This is an event already that is unprecedented. But the President is not
notified and going to a Florida elementary school to hear children read.

By around 8:15 AM, it should be very apparent that something is terribly
wrong. The President is glad-handing teachers.

By 8:45, when American Airlines Flight 11 crashes into the World Trade
Center, Bush is settling in with children for his photo ops at Booker
Elementary. Four planes have obviously been hijacked simultaneously, an
event never before seen in history, and one has just dived into the worlds
best know twin towers, and still no one notifies the nominal Commander in
Chief. 

No one has apparently scrambled any Air Force interceptors either.

At 9:03, United Flight 175 crashes into the remaining World Trade Center
building. At 9:05, Andrew Card, the Presidential Chief of Staff whispers to
George W. Bush. Bush ""briefly turns somber"" according to reporters.

Does he cancel the school visit and convene an emergency meeting? No.

He resumes listening to second graders read about a little girl's pet
fucking goat, and continues this banality even as American Airlines Flight
77 conducts an unscheduled point turn over Ohio and heads in the direction
of Washington DC. 

Has he instructed Chief of Staff Card to scramble the Air Force? No.

An excruciating 25 minutes later, he finally deigns to give a public
statement telling the United States what they already have figured out; that
there's been an attack by hijacked planes on the World Trade Center.

There's a hijacked plane bee-lining to Washington, but has the Air Force
been scrambled to defend anything yet? No.

At 9:30, when he makes his announcement, American Flight 77 is still ten
minutes from its target, the Pentagon.

The Administration will later claim they had no way of knowing that the
Pentagon might be a target, and that they thought Flight 77 was headed to
the White House, but the fact is that the plane has already flown South and
past the White House no-fly zone, and is in fact tearing through the sky at
over 400 nauts. 

At 9:35, this plane conducts another turn, 360 degrees over the Pentagon,
all the while being tracked by radar, and the Pentagon is not evacuated, and
there are still no fast-movers from the Air Force in the sky over Alexandria
and DC. 

Now, the real kicker. A pilot they want us to believe was trained at a
Florida puddle-jumper school for Piper Cubs and Cessnas, conducts a
well-controlled downward spiral, descending the last 7,000 feet in
two-and-a-half minutes, brings the plane in so low and flat that it clips
the electrical wires across the street from the Pentagon, and flies it with
pinpoint accuracy into the side of this building at 460 nauts.

When the theory about learning to fly this well at the puddle-jumper school
began to lose ground, it was added that they received further training on a
flight simulator. 

This is like saying you prepared your teenager for her first drive on I-40
at rush hour by buying her a video driving game. It's horse shit!

There is a story being constructed about these events. My crystal ball is
not working today, so I can't say why. But at the least, this so-called
Commander-in-Chief and his staff that we are all supposed to follow blindly
into some ill-defined war on terrorism is criminally negligent or
unspeakably stupid. And at the worst, if more is known or was known, and
there is an effort to conceal the facts, there is a criminal conspiracy
going on. 

Certainly, the Bush de facto administration was facing a confluence of
crises from which they were temporarily rescued by this event. Whether they
played a sinister role or not, there is little doubt that they have at the
very least opportunistically pounced on this attack to overcome their lack
of legitimacy, to shift the blame for the encroaching recession from
capitalism to the September 11th terror attack, to legitimize their
pre-existing foreign policy agenda, and to establish and consolidate
repressive measures domestically and silence dissent. In many ways,
September 11th pulled the Bush cookies out of the fire.

And given them the green light to begin constructing a long-term scenario
within which to establish fascistic control measures at home and abroad as a
citadel for the ruling class in the catastrophic conjuncture that we are
entering based on the end of oil.

This elephant in the living room is being studiously ignored. In fact, the
domestic repression has already begun, officially and unofficially. It's
kind of a latter day McCarthyism. I participated in a teach-in at Chapel
Hill, North Carolina, on the 17th of September, and though not a single
person on the panel excused or justified the attacks, and every person there
offered either condolences and prayers for the victims, we were excoriated
within two days as ""enemies of America."" Yesterday an op-ed called for my
deportation (to where, one can only guess). Now Herr Ashcroft is fast
tracking the biggest abrogation of US civil liberties since the so-called
anti-terrorism legislation after the Oklahoma City bombing-which by the way
hasn't resulted in anti-terrorism but in the acceleration of the application
of the racist death penalty. The FBI has defined terrorist groups not by
whether any given group has ever acted as terrorists, but by their beliefs.
Some socialists and anti-globalization groups have already been identified
by name as terrorist groups, even though there is not a single shred of
evidence that they have ever participated in any criminal activity. It
reminds me of the Smith Act that was finally declared unconstitutional, but
only after a hell of a lot of people served a hell of a long time in jail
for the crime of thinking.

I think this also points to yet another huge problems that the Bush regime
was facing. Worldwide resistance to the whole so-called neoliberal agenda,
which is a prettied up term for debt-leverage imperialism. While debt and
the threat of sanctions has been used to coerce nations in the periphery, we
have to understand that the final guarantor of compliance remains military
action. For a global economic agenda, there is always a corresponding
political and military agenda.

The focal point of these actions in the short term is Southern Asia, but
they have already scripted this as a worldwide and protracted fight against
terrorism. It's far better than drug wars as a rationalization, and the drug
war thing was being discredited in any case. Leftists are regaining power
and popularity in Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Colombia, the
Dominican Republic, Haiti, Brazil, and Argentina. Cuba has gained immense
prestige over the last few years. The empire is beginning to unravel. We can
hardly justify intervention in these places by saying they are not towing
the economic line by allowing the absolute domination of their societies by
transnational corporations. That exposes the agenda. So we simply claim they
are supporting terrorism.

It's for all these reasons I say the left has missed the boat on this one,
by allowing them to get away with rushing past the question of who did what
on September 11th. If the official story is a lie, and I think the
circumstantial case is strong enough to stay with this question, then we
really do need to know what happened. And we need to understand concretely
what the motives of this administration are.

And we need to understand more than just their immediate motives, but where
the larger social forces that underwrite our situation right now are headed.
I do not think this administration is engaged in the deliberative process of
a political grouping that is on top of their game. They are putting together
some very deliberative technical solutions in response to a larger situation
that it slipping rapidly out of their control. Like clear cutting. There's a
very smart technology being employed to do a very dumb thing.

What they are responding to is not September 11th, but the beginning of a
permanent and precipitous decline in worldwide oil production, the beginning
of a deep and protracted worldwide recession, and the unraveling of the
empire. 

This brings me to a point about what all this means for Americans' security,
which they are perfectly justified to worry about. The actions being
prepared by this administration will not only not enhance our security, it
will significantly degrade it. Military action against many groups across
the globe, which is what the administration is telling us quite openly they
are planning to do, will put a lot of backs against the wall. That can't be
very secure. 

The concept of war being touted here is a violation of the principles of war
on several counts, and will inevitably lead to military catastrophes, if
you're inclined to view this from a position of moral and political
neutrality. 

And the people who are now in possession of half the world's remaining oil
reserves are subject to destabilization for which we can't even pretend to
predict the consequences-but loss of access to critical energy supplies is
certainly within the realm of possibility. Worst of all, we will be
destabilizing Pakistan, a nuclear power in an active conflict with its
neighbor, and we will be provoking Russia, another nuclear power. The
security stakes don't get any higher, and Americans can ill afford to ignore
nukes. 

And I think that this domestic agenda is a tremendous threat to the security
of anyone who is critical of the government or their corporate financiers,
and we already know that the real threats are against populations that can
easily be scapegoated as the domestic crisis deepens. There is a very real
threat right now of creeping fascism in this country, and that phenomenon
requires its domestic enemies. Historically those enemies have included
leftists, trade unionists, and racially and nationally oppressed sectors.
This whole ""state of emergency"" mentality is already being used to quiet the
public discourses of anti-racism, of feminism, of environmentalism, and of
both socialism and anarchism. And while there is token resistance by
officials to anti-Muslim xenophobia, the stereotypical images have saturated
the media, and the government is already beginning to openly re-instate
racial profiling. It is only a short step from there to go after other
groups. We have long been prepared by the ideologies of overt and covert
racism, and racism as both institution and corresponding psychology in the
United States is nearly intractable.

It's for all these reason, I say emphatically that we can not accept
anything from this administration; not their policies nor their bullshit
stories. What they are doing is very, very dangerous, and the time to fight
back against them, openly, is right now, before they can consolidate their
power and their agenda. Once they have done that, our job becomes much more
difficult. 

The left, if it has the capacity to self-organize out of its oblivion, needs
to understand its critical roles here. We have to play the role of credible,
hard-working, and non-sectarian partners in a broader peace-movement. We
have to study, synthesize, and describe our current historical conjuncture.
And we have to prepare leadership for the decisive conflict that will emerge
to first defeat fascism then take political power.

Rosa Luxemburg's words are truer than ever right now. We are not faced with
a choice between socialism and capitalism, but socialism or barbarism. And
what we can least afford are denial and timidity.

"FW: Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Wright, Lee  
Sent:	Thursday, October 18, 2001 4:37 PM
To:	Bodyshop
Subject:	Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage


To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

"Re: *EMCA* Bomar/Morgan Drainage","Scott, Nathalie, Gayle and everyone else involved:

 

This was a great contribution to the project.  We need community memories: someone like you and Candalaria Moreno with good memories and someone with a big hard disk to archive our e-mails.  I discovered a couple of other contributing factors: Mrs. Moreno or someone at 405 Bomar must have had a problem going from their driveway into a slightly elevated Bomar, so they pored a concrete ramp to connect their driveway and the street.  It forms a dam so they put a four inch pipe in the cement. It's too small and is probably filled with debris.  And the 1916 cover for the storm sewer drain at Willard and Morgan has caved in so it now blocks the drain instead of covering it.


I made a little map (based on the HCAD map) which I'm attaching, hoping that it doesn't take too long to download.  Let me know if you see something that should be added or substracted before I take it to Ada Edwards' office.

before?  There are sidewalks on both sides of Welch all the way from 
Taft to Montrose with the exception of the stretch in front of his

"*EMCA* Lost Dog","If anyone has seen our dog, Meesha, please call us at 713-522-3644.  
She is brindled (black and brown), about 40 pounds (she's chubby) and 
very friendly - unless you are the mailman.  

She responds to her name or anything else for that matter as long as 
you have food in your hands.  She does have her collar with tags for 
Neartown Vet Clinic.

I accidently left the gate open today and she left.  I found our 
other dog, Zoey, around Morgan and Bomar but there was no sign of the 
little one.

Please, if you have seen her let us know.  We are very upset about 
this.  We lost one of our cats to cancer this past month and losing 
another would be too hard.

Thanks,

"GIR Proceeding--I99-07-003","Below is a link to the Proposed Decision by  Com. Bilas on the Gas Industry Restructuring proceeding that has been lingering on the agenda for most of the year.  This was just issued late last week and published today.  I'm still in the process of reviewing it but the good news is that he is proposing the adoption of the Comprehensive Settlement which Transwestern helped design and supported along with most other participants.  The decision does however make some modifications which may not be in our best interest i.e. the adoption of a price cap for secondary market transactions.  Due to the lapse in time on this proceeding, Com. Bilas has granted participants the right to file comments by Friday, October 19, 2001.  Please review and advise if you agree we should file comments (I also have a call into Mark Baldwin).  Note this is 140+ pages--you may wish to review the summary and pertinent sections.
