Morning, Teb:
I just found the message you left yesterday. Am sending you this email to
see if you can get it. Did you get my telephone message this morning about
retirement plan here at SDE? They put in 3% so I think I'll just have to let
that be all that's deducted from my paycheck for the time being. If you
think this is definitely a mistake, let me know. Please reply if you get
this email.
Love,

Sandy

Subject:	Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles

Based upon our understanding of the request from TW Marketing, here is our suggested position on the posting and awarding of potential take-away capacity at SoCal Needles from approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.

TW would post on its website a notice in the capacity section that, based on information provided by SoCal regarding an expansion on their system, the take-away capacity at SoCal Needless may be increased by __Dth/day for the period of approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.  Shippers would be advised that the actual start date would depend on SoCal completing their system modifications. The posting would say that TW would accept requests for such capacity during a stated period of time (a minimum of 3 business days).  TW would award the capacity to the shipper(s) willing to provide the greatest cost commitment. The greatest cost commitment would be defined as those revenues above and beyond the current revenues which Transwestern already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.

Call me and I'll arrange for us to meet to discuss this further.   sjk

This is really pretty funny!
  

  _____  

A Cat's Tale... 

This is the story of the night my ten-year-old cat, Rudy, got his head stuck in the garbage disposal. I  knew at the time that the experience would be funny if the cat survived, so let me tell you right up front that he's fine. 

Getting him out wasn't easy, though, and the process included numerous home remedies, a plumber, two cops, an emergency overnight veterinary clinic, a case of mistaken identity, five hours of panic, and fifteen minutes of fame. 

First, some background. My husband, Bill, and I had just returned from a five-day spring-break vacation in the Cayman Islands, where I had been sick as a dog the 
whole time, trying to convince myself that if I had to feel lousy, it was better to do it in paradise. 

We had arrived home at 9 PM, a day and a half later than we had planned because of airline problems. I still had illness-related vertigo, and because of the flight delays, had not been able to prepare the class I was supposed to teach at 8:40 the next morning. I sat down at my desk to think about William Carlos Williams, and around ten o'clock I heard Bill hollering something undecipherable from the kitchen. 

As I raced out to see what was wrong, I saw Bill frantically rooting around under the kitchen sink and Rudy, or rather, Rudy's headless body, scrambling around in the sink, his claws clicking in panic on the metal. 

Bill had just ground up the skin of some smoked salmon in the garbage disposal, and when he left the room, Rudy (whom we always did call a pinhead) had gone in 
after it. 

It is very disturbing to see the headless body of your cat in the sink. This is an animal that I have slept with nightly for ten years, who burrows under the covers and purrs against my side, and who now looked like a desperate, fur-covered turkey carcass, set to defrost in the sink while it's still alive and kicking. It was also disturbing to see Bill, Mr. Calm-in-any-Emergency, at his wits end, trying to 
soothe Rudy, trying to undo the garbage disposal, failing at both, and basically freaking out. 

Adding to the chaos was Rudy's twin brother Lowell, also upset, racing around in circles, jumping onto the kitchen counter and alternately licking Rudy's butt for comfort and biting it out of fear. Clearly, I had to do something. 

First we tried to ease Rudy out of the disposal by lubricating his head and neck. We tried Johnson's baby shampoo (kept on hand for my nieces visits) and butter-flavored Crisco: both failed, and a now-greasy Rudy kept struggling. 

Bill then decided to take apart the garbage disposal, which was a good idea, but he couldn't do it. Turns out, the thing is constructed like a metal onion: you peel off one layer and another one appears, with Rudy's head still buried deep inside, stuck in a hard plastic collar. My job during this process was to sit on the kitchen counter petting Rudy, trying to calm him, with the room spinning (vertigo), Lowell howling (he's part Siamese), and Bill clattering around with tools. 

When all our efforts failed, we sought professional help. I called our regular plumber, who actually called me back quickly, even at 11 o'clock at night (thanks, Dave). He talked Bill through further layers of disposal dismantling, but still we couldn't reach Rudy. I called the 1-800 number for Insinkerator (no response), a pest removal service that advertises 24-hour service (no response), an all-night emergency veterinary clinic (who had no experience in this matter, and so, no advice), and finally, in desperation, 911. I could see that Rudy's normally pink paw pads were turning blue. The fire department, I figured, gets cats out of trees; maybe they could get one out of a garbage disposal. 

The dispatcher had other ideas and offered to send over two policemen. This suggestion gave me pause. I'm from the sixties, and even if I am currently a fine 
upstanding citizen, I had never considered calling the cops and asking them to come to my house, on purpose.  I resisted the suggestion, but the dispatcher was 
adamant: ""They'll help you out,"" he said. 

The cops arrived close to midnight and turned out to be quite nice. More importantly, they were also able to think rationally, which we were not. 

They were, of course, quite astonished by the situation: ""I've never seen anything like this,"" Officer Mike kept saying. (The unusual circumstances helped us get quickly on a first-name basis with our cops.) 

Officer Tom expressed immediate sympathy for our plight. ""I have had cats all my life,"" he said, comfortingly. Also he had an idea. Evidently we needed a certain tool, a tiny, circular rotating saw that could cut through the heavy plastic flange encircling Rudy's neck without hurting Rudy, and Officer Tom happened to own one. ""I live just five minutes from here,"" he said; ""I'll go get it."" 

He soon returned, and the three of them, Bill and the two policemen got under the sink together to cut through the garbage disposal. I sat on the counter, holding Rudy and trying not to succumb to the surreal-ness of the scene, with the weird 
middle-of-the-night lighting, the rooms occasional spinning, Lowell's spooky sound effects, an apparently headless cat in my sink and six disembodied legs poking out from under it. One good thing came of this:  the guys did manage to get the bottom of the disposal, so we could now see Rudy's face and knew he could 
breathe. But they couldn't cut the flange without risking the cat. 

Stumped, Officer Tom had another idea. ""You know,"" he said, ""I think the reason we can't get him out is the angle of his head and body. If we could just get the 
sink out and lay it on its side, I'll bet we could slip him out."" That sounded like a good idea at this point, ANYTHING would have sounded like a good idea and as it turned out, Officer Mike runs a plumbing business on weekends; he knew how to take out the sink! Again they went to work, the three pairs of legs sticking out from under the sink surrounded by an ever-increasing pile of tools and sink parts. They cut the electrical supply, capped off the plumbing lines, unfastened the metal clamps, unscrewed all the pipes, and about an hour later, voila! The sink was lifted gently out of the countertop, with one guy holding the garbage disposal (which contained Rudy's head) up close to the sink (which contained Rudy's body). We laid the sink on its side, but even at this more favorable removal angle, Rudy stayed stuck. 

Officer Tom's radio beeped, calling him away on some kind of real police business. As he was leaving, though, he had another good idea: ""You know,"" he said, 
""I don't think we can get him out while he's struggling so much. We need to get the cat sedated. If he were limp, we could slide him out."" And off he went, regretfully, a cat lover still worried about Rudy. 

The remaining three of us decided that getting Rudy sedated was a good idea, but Bill and I were new to the area. We knew that the overnight emergency 
veterinary clinic was only a few minutes away, but we didn't know exactly how to get there. ""I know where it is!"" declared Officer Mike. ""Follow me!"" 

So Mike got into his patrol car, Bill got into the drivers seat of our car, and I got into the back, carrying the kitchen sink, what was left of the garbage disposal, and Rudy. 

It was now about 2:00 a.m. We followed Officer Mike for a few blocks when I decided to put my hand into the garbage disposal to pet Rudy's face, hoping I 
could comfort him. Instead, my sweet, gentle bedfellow chomped down on my finger, hard, really hard and wouldn't let go. My scream reflex kicked into gear, 
and I couldn't stop the noise. Bill slammed on the breaks, hollering ""What? What happened? Should I stop?"" checking us out in the rear view mirror. 

""No,"" I managed to get out between screams, ""just keep driving. Rudy's biting me, but we've got to get to the vet. Just go!"" 

Bill turned his attention back to the road, where Officer Mike took a turn we hadn't expected, and we followed. After a few minutes Rudy let go, and as I 
stopped screaming, I looked up to discover that we were wandering aimlessly through an industrial park, in and out of empty parking lots, past little streets 
that didn't look at all familiar. ""Where's he taking us?"" I asked. ""We should have been there ten minutes ago!"" 

Bill was as mystified as I was, but all we knew to do was follow the police car until, finally, he pulled into a church parking lot and we pulled up next to him. 

As Bill rolled down the window to ask Mike ""where are we going?"" the cop, who was not Mike, rolled down his window and asked, ""Why are you following me?"" Once Bill and I recovered from our shock at having tailed the wrong cop car and the policeman from his pique at being stalked, led us quickly to the emergency vet, where Mike greeted us by holding open the door, exclaiming, ""Where were you guys?"" 

It was lucky that Mike got to the vets ahead of us, because we hadn't thought to call and warn them about what was coming. (Clearly, by this time we weren't 
really thinking at all.) We brought in the kitchen sink containing Rudy and the garbage disposal containing his head, and the clinic staff was ready. They took his temperature (which was down 10-degrees) and his oxygen level (which was half of normal), and the vet declared: ""This cat is in serious shock. We've got to sedate him and get him out of there immediately."" 

When I asked if it was OK to sedate a cat in shock, the vet said grimly, ""We don't have a choice."" With that, he injected the cat; Rudy went limp; and the vet 
squeezed about half a tube of K-Y jelly onto the cat's neck and pulled him free. 

Then the whole team jumped into code blue mode. (I know this from watching a lot of ER) They laid Rudy on a cart, where one person hooked up IV fluids, another 
put little socks on his paws (""You'd be amazed how much heat they lose through their pads,"" she said), one covered him with hot water bottles and a blanket, 
and another took a blow-dryer to warm up Rudy's now very gunky head. The fur on his head dried in stiff little spikes, making him look rather pathetically punk as he lay there, limp and motionless. 

At this point they sent Bill, Mike, and me to sit in the waiting room while they tried to bring Rudy back to life. I told Mike he didn't have to stay, but he just stood there, shaking his head. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" he said again. 

At about 3 AM, the vet came in to tell us that the prognosis was good for a full recovery. They needed to keep Rudy overnight to re-hydrate him and give him 
something for the brain swelling they assumed he had, but if all went well, we could take him home the following night. 

Just in time to hear the good news, Officer Tom rushed in, finished with his real police work and concerned about Rudy. I figured that once this ordeal was over 
and Rudy was home safely, I would have to re-think my position on the police. 

Bill and I got back home about 3:30. We hadn't unpacked from our trip, I was still intermittently dizzy, and I still hadn't prepared my 8:40 class. ""I need a vacation,"" I said, and while I called the office to leave a message canceling my class, Bill 
made us a pitcher of martinis. I slept late the next day and then badgered the vet about Rudy's condition until he said that Rudy could come home later that day. 

I was working on the suitcases when the phone rang. ""Hi, this is Steve Huskey from the Norristown Times-Herald,"" a voice told me. ""Listen, I was just going through the police blotter from last night.  Mostly it's the usual stuff: Breaking and entering, petty theft but there's this one item. Um, do you have a cat?"" So I told Steve the whole story, which interested him. A couple hours later he called back to 
say that his editor was interested, too; did I have a picture of Rudy? The next day Rudy was front-page news, under the ridiculous headline Catch of the Day Lands Cat in Hot Water. 

There were some noteworthy repercussions to the newspaper article. Mr. Huskey had somehow inferred that I called 911 because I thought Bill, my husband, was going into shock, although how he concluded this from my comment that his pads were turning blue, I don't quite understand. So the first thing I had to do was call Bill at work. Bill, who had worked tirelessly to free Rudy--and swear that I had been misquoted.  When I arrived at work myself, I was famous; people had been calling my secretary all morning to inquire about Rudy's health. 

When I called our regular vet (whom I had met only once) to make a follow-up appointment for Rudy, the receptionist asked, ""Is this the famous Rudy's mother?"" When I brought my car in for routine maintenance a few days later, Dave, my mechanic, said, ""We read about your cat. Is he OK?"" When I called a tree surgeon about my dying red oak, he asked if I knew the person on that street whose cat had been in the garbage disposal. 

And when I went to get my hair cut, the shampoo person told me the funny story her grandma had read in the paper, about a cat that got stuck in the garbage 
disposal. Even today, over a year later, people ask about Rudy, whom a 9-year-old neighbor had always called the Adventure Cat because he used to climb on 
the roof of her house and peer in the second-story window at her. 

I don't know what the moral of this story is, but I do know that this adventure cost me $1100 in emergency vet bills, follow-up vet care, a new sink, new plumbing, new electrical wiring, and a new garbage disposal, one with a cover. The vet can no longer say he's seen everything but the kitchen sink. I wanted to thank Officers Tom and Mike by giving them gift certificates to the local hardware store, but was told that they couldn't accept gifts, that I would put them in a bad position if I tried. So I wrote a letter to the Police Chief praising their good deeds and sent 
individual thank-you notes to Tom and Mike, complete with pictures of Rudy, so they could see what he looks like with his head on. And Rudy, whom we originally 
got for free (or so we thought), still sleeps with me under the covers on cold nights and unaccountably, he still sometimes prowls the sink, hoping for fish...

Please complete as much of the form as you can in support of Alice, and return it to me by the end of this week.

Transwestern is getting ready to begin testing their new contract system.  In preparation for implementation of the new system, we need to make changes to TW's tariff to allow the option of Electronic Contracting the same way we did to FGT's tariff when we implemented their new system.  

The new contract system is scheduled to go into production Q1, 2002.

Teb:
I was talking to Drew and Janet Place last night about some of the Lakehead tax issues.  Janet indicated that as part of Border's argument on including a tax component in its rates, it demonstrated that if they did not collect taxes in their rates, they should add back the accumulated deferred income tax balance to the rate base (some $300 million) which caused their rates to increase.  If TW were to do the same thing, would its rate also increase? I seem to recall that excluding the reserve for uncollectible accounts that was set up as part of the Enron bankruptcy, TW's accumulated FIT balance was close to $300 million.  Any thoughts on this?

We are currently discussing several potential approaches for a ""Phase VII"" expansion project.  We have preliminary work underway on several potential scenarios, some of which might involve Gulfstream as an upstream transporter.  

As part of these discussions, Gulfstream has inquired about FGT's interest in providing a capacity lease for backhaul service (approximately 20-30 miles - they did not identify the specific market). 

My questions are:
	(1) Backhaul capacity lease with an interstate pipeline - Do you see any problems/issues?  The lease arrangement would be with Guflstream Pipeline.

	(2) If this backhaul lease capacity is used by Gulfstream to provide deliveries to an electric generator, would the FP&L Favored Nations Clause be triggered?

All,

We are still working on all the details of the proposed interconnect with Questar Southern Trails in the Blanco Hub and will send you a copy soon for your review.  Since the interconnect is fully reimbursable, Questar is proposing to pay us according to the attached payment schedule vs. paying all of it up front.  

Please take a look at this attached schedule and provide me you comments.  If we allow them to pay ""along the way"" I am interested in making sure it at least matches the timing of our cash outlay of building the interconnect.  The total estimate of $702,000 includes the tax gross up, which may or may not be applicable, so each of these amount may be reduced by the tax amount.


Does anyone have any concerns with the timing of the payment schedule?  

Thanks, Kim.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Subject: Quote for the day, #1,246.


""The ground war in Afghanistan hotted up yesterday when the Allies revealed plans to airdrop a platoon of crack French existentialist philosophers into the country to destroy the morale of Taleban zealots by proving the non-existence of God.
 
Elements from the feared Jean-Paul Sartre Brigade, or 'Black Berets', will be parachuted into the combat zones to spread doubt, despondency and existential anomie among the enemy. Hardened by numerous intellectual battles fought during their long occupation of Paris's Left Bank, their first action will be to establish a number of pavement cafes at strategic points near the front lines. There they will drink coffee and talk animatedly about the absurd nature of life and man's lonely isolation in the universe. They will be accompanied by a number of heartbreakingly beautiful girlfriends who will further spread dismay by sticking their tongues in the philosophers' ears every five minutes and looking remote and unattainable to everyone else.
 
Their leader, Colonel Marc-Ange Belmondo, spoke yesterday of his confidence in the success of their mission. Sorbonne graduate Belmondo, a very intense and unshaven young man in a black pullover, gesticulated wildly and said, 'The Taleban are caught in a logical fallacy of the most ridiculous. There is no God and I can prove it. Take your tongue out of my ear, Juliet, I am talking.' Marc-Ange plans to deliver an impassioned thesis on man's nauseating freedom of action with special reference to the work of Foucault and the films of Alfred Hitchcock. 
 
However, humanitarian agencies have been quick to condemn the operation as inhumane, pointing out that the effects of passive smoking from the Frenchmen's endless Gitanes could wreak a terrible toll on civilians in the area. 
  
Speculation was mounting last night that Britain may also contribute to the effort by dropping Professor Stephen Hawking into Afghanistan to propagate his non-deistic theory of the creation of the universe. 
  
Other tactics to demonstrate the non-existence of God will include the dropping of leaflets pointing out the fact that Michael Jackson has a new album out and Oprah Winfrey has not died yet.
  
This is only one of several Psy-Ops operations mounted by the Allies to undermine the unswerving religious fanaticism that fuels the Taleban's fighting spirit. Pentagon sources have recently confirmed rumours that America has already sent in a 200-foot-tall robot Jesus, which roams the Taleban front lines glowing eerily and shooting flames out of its fingers while saying, 'I am the way, the truth and the life, follow me or die.' However, plans to have the giant Christ kick the crap out of a slightly effeminate 80-foot Mohammed in central Kabul were discarded as insensitive to Muslim allies.""

Thought you might enjoy this.


An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk"". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

Chris Snyder with FPU called and asked if the New Smyrna point, poi 16160 on contract 100740 (which is the only delivery point on that contract that they permanently acquired through capacity release) could be made a division.  The point was acquired through a permanent capacity release transaction as a single point. 

The problem is that they requested to combine this point into their current dpoa, contract 5002 that has points behind divisions.  The allocation reports he gets do not reflect this point since it is not in a division.  Can we make a point a division just so the reports can ""pick up"" the point?  Chris also mentioned that he does not want this point in a separate dpoa because he wants to be able to take advantage of the section 11 rights with their other delivery points on their dpoa.  

Frazier and Teb, please let me know if we can do this so that we can make the appropriate changes in our system.  nb

Another tidbit to remind us that we see/hear Divinity all around us: 

Just remember, ""Our God is an Awesome God!"" 

READ This All the Way, and send it back please! 
This will give you the chills.....GOOD Chills! 

A young man had been to Wed. night Bible Study. The pastor had shared
about listening to God and obeying the Lord's voice. The young man
couldn't help but wonder, Does God still speak to people?"" 

After service, he went out with some friends for coffee 
and pie, and they discussed the message. Several different ones talked
about how God had led them in different ways.

It was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home.
Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, ""God...If you still speak to
people speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey."" 

As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest
thought to stop and buy a gallon of milk. He shook his head and said out
loud, ""God is that you?""  He didn't get a reply and started on toward
home. 

But again, the thought, buy a gallon of milk. The young man thought
about Samuel and how he didn't recognize the voice of God, and how
little Samuel ran to Eli. ""Okay, God, in case that is you, I will buy
the milk."" It didn't seem like too hard a test of obedience. He could
always use the milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of milk and
started off toward home. 

As he passed Seventh Street, he again felt the urge, ""Turn down that
street."" This is crazy he thought and drove on past the intersection.
Again, he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street. At the next
intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he
said out loud, ""Okay, God, I will."" 

He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop.
He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in a
semi-commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst
of neighborhoods either. The businesses were closed and most of the
houses looked dark like the people were already in bed.

Again, he sensed something, ""Go and give the milk to the people in the
house across the street."" The young man looked at the house. It was dark
and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already
asleep. He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat.
""Lord, this is insane. Those people are asleep and, if I wake them up,
they are going to be mad and I will look stupid."" 

Again, he felt like he should go and give the milk. Finally, he opened
the door.   ""Okay God, if this is you, I will go to the door and I will
give them the milk. If you want me to look like a crazy person, okay. I
want to be obedient. I guess that will count for something, but, if they
don't answer right away, I am out of here. 

He walked across the street and rang the bell. He could hear some noise
inside. A man's voice yelled out, ""Who is it? What do you want?""   Then
the door opened before the young man could get away.    The man was
standing there in his jeans and t-shirt.  He looked like he just got out
of bed. He had a strange look on his face, and he didn't seem too happy
to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. ""What is it?"" The young
man thrust out the gallon of milk. ""Here I brought this to you."" 

The man took the milk and rushed down a hallway, speaking loudly in
Spanish. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the milk toward
the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was
crying. The man had tears streaming down his face. The man began
speaking and half-crying, ""We were just praying. We had some big bills
this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any milk for our
baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some
milk."" 

His wife in the kitchen yelled out, ""I ask him to send an Angel with
some. Are you an Angel?""

The young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he
had on him and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward
his car and the tears were streaming down his face.   He knew that God
still answers prayers. 

This is a simple test... 

If you believe that God is alive and well, send this to at least ten
people and the person that sent it to you!

I talked with Rod about the purpose of the meeting.  Stan wants to start thinking about the assumptions for the 2004 rate case and a ten year Plan.  I will bring the 2002 Plan but it is really a short-term Plan and Rod does not want me to hand out anything.  It is a strategy session.

We assumed in the Plan a rate drop effective 1/1/05.  I would like to review the assumptions behind that with Teb and Blair to better understand how it was derived.  This will be one of the major issues for discussion.

"RE: TW Overhead WO","We can charge directly but still need some guidance.  For example, it is my understanding that there are 4 WO set up for Red Rock - one for each station to be modified.  Our work is of a general nature, so do we have to further subdivide our charges to each of the stations, or to three of the stations.  Also, some of our time is spent on a general analysis of regulatory strategy involving all capital projects, and it seems like the overhead WO would be appropriate for these charges.  We don't necessarily want to have to have each person charge to 3 or 4 WO for each identifiable capital project and then to 10 or more WO for our general work.  Any specific suggestions, WO numbers, etc. ?

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron. 
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me."" 
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started. 
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985. 
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 
You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.
""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.
""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""

Tab,

I don't disagree with your comment however, my recollection is that one of the main reasons we made the decision we did was because the commercial folks didn't want to have to reopen the agreement with a rate amendment.  The concern I though was that such an overture would possibly send the wrong message to the customer or possibly create a perception that the customer had some leverage.  My question is, not that we need to amend the agreement for other reasons should we add the discounted rate... do it all at once?  Please provide your thoughts.  Thanks.  Greg

Teb,

In talking with Michelle Brown about billing the Conoco contract, she was wondering if we needed to changed the tariff rate sheets for the Current Firm Customers.  I believe I copied you on the Conoco contract e:mail on the TCR II surcharges.  I was thinking (before talking with Michelle) that we really did not have to change those tariff sheets (5B.02 and 5B.03); however, I am not so sure anymore.  The CFC rates on 5B.02 do not apply to Conoco anymore.  So do we need to take them off?  There is a note on 5B.02 that says the surcharges on 5B.03 (TCR II) are applicable to the CFCs listed on 5B.02.

So my question:  Do we just leave the tariff sheets alone, since Conoco's contracts under the Global and Mini- Settlements have terminated, or do we need to update this sheets?

I do not think this is urgent, but I wanted to ask.

Jeanette

Subject: Quote for the day, #1,246.


""The ground war in Afghanistan hotted up yesterday when the Allies revealed plans to airdrop a platoon of crack French existentialist philosophers into the country to destroy the morale of Taleban zealots by proving the non-existence of God.
 
Elements from the feared Jean-Paul Sartre Brigade, or 'Black Berets', will be parachuted into the combat zones to spread doubt, despondency and existential anomie among the enemy. Hardened by numerous intellectual battles fought during their long occupation of Paris's Left Bank, their first action will be to establish a number of pavement cafes at strategic points near the front lines. There they will drink coffee and talk animatedly about the absurd nature of life and man's lonely isolation in the universe. They will be accompanied by a number of heartbreakingly beautiful girlfriends who will further spread dismay by sticking their tongues in the philosophers' ears every five minutes and looking remote and unattainable to everyone else.
 
Their leader, Colonel Marc-Ange Belmondo, spoke yesterday of his confidence in the success of their mission. Sorbonne graduate Belmondo, a very intense and unshaven young man in a black pullover, gesticulated wildly and said, 'The Taleban are caught in a logical fallacy of the most ridiculous. There is no God and I can prove it. Take your tongue out of my ear, Juliet, I am talking.' Marc-Ange plans to deliver an impassioned thesis on man's nauseating freedom of action with special reference to the work of Foucault and the films of Alfred Hitchcock. 
 
However, humanitarian agencies have been quick to condemn the operation as inhumane, pointing out that the effects of passive smoking from the Frenchmen's endless Gitanes could wreak a terrible toll on civilians in the area. 
  
Speculation was mounting last night that Britain may also contribute to the effort by dropping Professor Stephen Hawking into Afghanistan to propagate his non-deistic theory of the creation of the universe. 
  
Other tactics to demonstrate the non-existence of God will include the dropping of leaflets pointing out the fact that Michael Jackson has a new album out and Oprah Winfrey has not died yet.
  
This is only one of several Psy-Ops operations mounted by the Allies to undermine the unswerving religious fanaticism that fuels the Taleban's fighting spirit. Pentagon sources have recently confirmed rumours that America has already sent in a 200-foot-tall robot Jesus, which roams the Taleban front lines glowing eerily and shooting flames out of its fingers while saying, 'I am the way, the truth and the life, follow me or die.' However, plans to have the giant Christ kick the crap out of a slightly effeminate 80-foot Mohammed in central Kabul were discarded as insensitive to Muslim allies.""

Therefore, I suggest we do neither.

 
Let the Special Forces, Seals or whatever, covertly capture him, fly him to an undisclosed hospital and have surgeons quickly perform a complete sex change operation.  Then return her to Afghanistan to live as a woman under the Taliban.

Regarding the end date, we are being required to put some sort of end date into our system.  We can always go back in to extend should the assignment go beyond that date.  Would you like me to extend it for 3 or 6 months, or through the end of 2002?

I'll wait to hear back from Debbie on the coding.  

Thanks for the update!
Liz

Another tidbit to remind us that we see/hear Divinity all around us: 

Just remember, ""Our God is an Awesome God!"" 

READ This All the Way, and send it back please! 
This will give you the chills.....GOOD Chills! 

A young man had been to Wed. night Bible Study. The pastor had shared
about listening to God and obeying the Lord's voice. The young man
couldn't help but wonder, Does God still speak to people?"" 

After service, he went out with some friends for coffee 
and pie, and they discussed the message. Several different ones talked
about how God had led them in different ways.

It was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home.
Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, ""God...If you still speak to
people speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey."" 

As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest
thought to stop and buy a gallon of milk. He shook his head and said out
loud, ""God is that you?""  He didn't get a reply and started on toward
home. 

But again, the thought, buy a gallon of milk. The young man thought
about Samuel and how he didn't recognize the voice of God, and how
little Samuel ran to Eli. ""Okay, God, in case that is you, I will buy
the milk."" It didn't seem like too hard a test of obedience. He could
always use the milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of milk and
started off toward home. 

As he passed Seventh Street, he again felt the urge, ""Turn down that
street."" This is crazy he thought and drove on past the intersection.
Again, he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street. At the next
intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he
said out loud, ""Okay, God, I will."" 

He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop.
He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in a
semi-commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst
of neighborhoods either. The businesses were closed and most of the
houses looked dark like the people were already in bed.

Again, he sensed something, ""Go and give the milk to the people in the
house across the street."" The young man looked at the house. It was dark
and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already
asleep. He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat.
""Lord, this is insane. Those people are asleep and, if I wake them up,
they are going to be mad and I will look stupid."" 

Again, he felt like he should go and give the milk. Finally, he opened
the door.   ""Okay God, if this is you, I will go to the door and I will
give them the milk. If you want me to look like a crazy person, okay. I
want to be obedient. I guess that will count for something, but, if they
don't answer right away, I am out of here. 

He walked across the street and rang the bell. He could hear some noise
inside. A man's voice yelled out, ""Who is it? What do you want?""   Then
the door opened before the young man could get away.    The man was
standing there in his jeans and t-shirt.  He looked like he just got out
of bed. He had a strange look on his face, and he didn't seem too happy
to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. ""What is it?"" The young
man thrust out the gallon of milk. ""Here I brought this to you."" 

The man took the milk and rushed down a hallway, speaking loudly in
Spanish. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the milk toward
the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was
crying. The man had tears streaming down his face. The man began
speaking and half-crying, ""We were just praying. We had some big bills
this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any milk for our
baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some
milk."" 

His wife in the kitchen yelled out, ""I ask him to send an Angel with
some. Are you an Angel?""

The young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he
had on him and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward
his car and the tears were streaming down his face.   He knew that God
still answers prayers. 

This is a simple test... 

If you believe that God is alive and well, send this to at least ten
people and the person that sent it to you!

"RE: Paper Situation","To EPLF and its sympathizers:   Unless the toaster is returned immediately, SADIST will commence an escalating series of  actions designed to bring all such terrorists to their knees.  We realize there may be some collateral damage, and for this we are truly sorry.  But we must end toaster terror forever.  Beginning at 0900 hours on 10 January 2002, SADIST will commence the following series of actions (each subsequent action will commence 2 hours after the preceeding sanction):
1. All deliveries of new business cards will be suspended
2. Napkins and paper towels will be removed from the kitchens
3. Post-it notes will be confiscated from all locations
4. Paper towels will be removed from all bathrooms
5. Toilet paper will be removed from all bathrooms ( Enron stock certificates will be issued for humanitarian reasons)

If the toaster still has not been returned, SADIST will be forced to remove all COFFEE FILTERS from the building, including the Energizer and Plaza Java.  Do not doubt our will to use this ultimate weapon, after all we are SADIST.

Subject:	RE: Paper Situation

It has come to the attention of the Dedicated Information Technology Programmers Addicted to Caffeine that we are somehow getting the short end of the stick in these negotiations.  We are generally used to this, but this is the last straw!  Being an often overlooked faction in these wars, we are however, very powerful.  Unless you provide us with the affricated drinks we require to survive, we will sabotage these negotiations.  We start by asking the following questions:  What are your requirements for paper?  Have you documented these requirements.  What is the cost justification for ordering this paper?  What printers are you using?  Does IT have to support these printers?  That will cost extra money.  What were the different requirements surrounding your use of the toaster?  Do you toast bread and waffles?  What other uses do you have for the toaster?  Anything not specifically included in your written requirements will be rejected as a scope enhancement and will cost more money or cause a delay in the return of your toaster.

To avoid further delays in the negotiations, please deliver bribes in 6-packs of 24-ounce bottles of the following:  Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, RC Cola, Jolt.  These payments should be left in the kitchen refrigerator so that they will be cold when we drink them in the morning.

Remember, paper without a working printer is the wrong print queue.  A toaster without power is a metal storage box.  We have the power and will use it.

We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread forever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad - to those who would resort to such extortion.  If we give in now, we will only encourage such acts in the future.  First our microwaves, then our filtered water dispenser, then our refrigerators will become targets of these evil doers.  Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron. 
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me."" 
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started. 
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985. 
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 
You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.
""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.
""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""

I have a question about the SFTS conversions that were done a while back so that the customer could utilize our capacity release program.  I noticed that The City of Chattahoochee converted their SFTS to FTS-1 and that the temporary acquisitions on their FTS-1 have a gap.  More specifically, they have a release in place for 10/1/02 thru 4/30/03 and the next release begins 10/1/03 thru 4/30/04.  Do the releases have to be consecutive in order for them to retain their conversion to FTS-1?  Because they will not have a release in place for May thru Sept. of 2003 according to their releases.  Is this wrong?  I haven't checked to see if this occurs on any of the other coversions and will if this is an issue.  Please advise.  nb

Because a large number of our invitees had conflicting schedules, we are moving the date of our Appreciation Luncheon for the LAST TIME!!! 

This will be our last attempt to accommodate everyone.  Trust me, the food and games at Jillians will be well worth your patience.

Steve's main objective was to include as many of  ETS' TW Teams as possible.  We feel that Friday,  the 5th of October would better suit the majority of our teams.  

We thank you for your patience and please respond by September 26.

I talked with Rod about the purpose of the meeting.  Stan wants to start thinking about the assumptions for the 2004 rate case and a ten year Plan.  I will bring the 2002 Plan but it is really a short-term Plan and Rod does not want me to hand out anything.  It is a strategy session.

We assumed in the Plan a rate drop effective 1/1/05.  I would like to review the assumptions behind that with Teb and Blair to better understand how it was derived.  This will be one of the major issues for discussion.

We will remain in 39C1 following Steve's meeting to discuss the strategy for resolving TW's Order 637 issues.  FERC Chairman Pat Wood has pledged to get all 637 orders issued by this August so we need to consider what we need to do to eliminate those proposals we no longer want and, hopefully, trade them for deferring segmenting until the next rate case.  Please invite anyone else who could benifit from or contribute to this meeting.

"RE: Question","The imbalance becomes part of thecumulative imbalance subject to book-out/cash-out.

Subject:	FW: Question

I'm not sure how the mechanics work on OFOs.  I know that there is an OFO penalty bucket.  The customer is charged $10/dth that he is over/under the scheduled quantity.  Section 13A doesn't address how the imbalance on an OFO day is treated but 13.A.5 that states that after Pack/Draft, Alert Day, MSS... are calculated the rest of the imbalance is cumulated into the operator account for the monthly total(should I assume the OFO balance is included in the monthly total?).

In an underage or overage OFO the customer is charged the $10 for the under or over burned amount. Assuming that the customer was in penalty he has to pay $10/dth, but does the imbalance on the OFO day become part of the cumulative monthly balance that the customer can book/cashout?

Teb, is this correct?

Galen, can you have Larry Hill go behind the scene and to see how it was programmed (I know it's a busy day for invoicing but sometime this week?).

Thanks.

Rachel,

To recap one question/answer:

In an OFO situation, the customer faces a $10/Dth penalty.  What happens to
the volume imbalance?  Is it immediately cashed-out as with the Overage
Alert Day, or does it hit the monthly imbalance for cash-out/book-out?

Do I have it right by saying that in an Alert Day situation, the volume is
immediately cashed-out daily?

When you get a minute, please advise.  Thank you!

David

Take a look at this.

Note that this does not address capacity release issues.
I think that might be too much for this letter.
I think we should take that up separately.
Probably, an ad hoc basis is best to start with.
For example, I think we should work with Marc of FPU on an individual basis and see what happens.
Then we would be able to feel more confident on whether to call a meeting on this or not.
