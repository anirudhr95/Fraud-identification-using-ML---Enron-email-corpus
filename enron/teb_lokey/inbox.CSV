URGENT ATTENTION 
Attention all Internet Users: 
This looks like a bad one that's coming. Forward this to others.

Please read and forward to everyone you know...... 
DO NOT OPEN: ""NEW PICTURES OF FAMILY"" 
It is a virus that will erase your whole ""C"" drive. 
It will come to you in the form of a E-mail from a familiar
person. 
I repeat a friend sent it to me, but called & warned me before I
opened it. 
He was not so lucky and now he can't even start his computer! 
Forward this to everyone in your address book. I would rather
receive this 25 times than not at all. Also: Intel announced
that a new and very destructive virus was discovered recently.
If you receive an email called ""FAMILY PICTURES,"" do not open
it. Delete it right away! 
This virus removes all dynamic link libraries (.dll files) from
your computer. 
Your computer will not be able to boot up. 
Thanks, 
Scott Shelley Tri-County I-NET, Inc. 
Sr. Technical Specialist

Subject:	Plan Assumptions with Stan, 2/6/02, 8:00 am

I talked with Rod about the purpose of the meeting.  Stan wants to start thinking about the assumptions for the 2004 rate case and a ten year Plan.  I will bring the 2002 Plan but it is really a short-term Plan and Rod does not want me to hand out anything.  It is a strategy session.

We assumed in the Plan a rate drop effective 1/1/05.  I would like to review the assumptions behind that with Teb and Blair to better understand how it was derived.  This will be one of the major issues for discussion.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

"Re: *EMCA* (no subject)","Hedda et al,

That is perfectly horrible.  In this neighborhood, it seems it is just a matter of time before a car is broken into if it is parked unsecured and especially if anything is visible inside the car.

EVERYONE - we are the only ones who can discourage this.  Any time you see someone who doesn't belong in the neighborhood wandering around aimlessly, call the police at the non-emergency number.  If they are not busy, they'll come ""interview"" these folks.  If they are under the influence of anything or not carrying id they can be jailed.  If the creeps get the message that if they walk though EMCA territory, they can be arrested, they may go elsewhere.  The cops seem happier to shake-down loiterers if there is a complainant involved rather than just cruising the neighborhood hassling folks. 

Happy and Safe Holidays,

BJS

  Neighbors, yesterday four cars were vandalized at Bomar St. The  glass windows were shatered. My cousin from Michigan was visiting me. The window behind the driver's seat was broken. The police was at Bomar and Grant with the same problem. I am sick and tired of this abuse. And yesterday I was also ashamed. It's not only the broken glass is all the secondary effects that this kind of incidents cause to the victim. And the perpetrators are probably laughing at all of us. Because for them is probably a joke. I am sorry of giving all of you this news in this beautiful day but we need to be aware. Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Hedda, 416 Bomar.

"Remote Access Changes","There have been numerous changes over the last few months with regard to how we remotely access the Enron computing environment.  As part of the ongoing consolidation of remote access services, the legacy CORP Windows 2000 VPN servers will be decommissioned on January 18, 2002.  All remaining users of this VPN solution will need to migrate to the eConnect VPN solution prior to this date, if you have not already done so. 

Please take the time over the next couple of days to test how you access our environment remotely.   Prior to leaving the office today, please print out the attachment which includes instructions to help you update your access.  Your action following the test will be as follows:

For High Speed Connections:  If you do not see an eConnect login screen as you come into the Enron environment, you will have to update the software on your computer.  
For Dial Up Connections:  If you do not have a Windows Dial Up connection, then you will have to set up a dial up connection.

We are working to have the documentation posted on the ETS website in the Solution Center section.

If you did not previously have remote access capabilities, you will need to complete an eRequest.  The eRequest system can be found at the following link:  http://itcapps.corp.enron.com/srrs/entry/srrs.asp.  

If you have any questions or need assistance filling out the eRequest, please contact the ETS Solution Center at the numbers below.

"New Course Offerings","Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread forever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad - to those who would resort to such extortion.  If we give in now, we will only encourage such acts in the future.  First our microwaves, then our filtered water dispenser, then our refrigerators will become targets of these evil doers.  Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!

"Message from Jim Saunders - TIMESHEETS","As many of you know, yesterday we closed on Dynegy's option to acquire Northern Natural.  Shortly, a more comprehensive message will be distributed about that transaction and what it means for all of us.  

One important requirement under that transaction is that Enron Operations Services Company has agreed to continue providing certain services to Northern consistent with our past operations.  Northern will be billed for those services, and we will be required to demonstrate the basis for those billings.  

Effective, Feb. 1, all employees in the ETS family of companies that perform any services for Northern or related to Northern's operations in any way should keep timesheets documenting the amount of time spent on Northern projects or supporting personnel and activities related to Northern projects.  

If there are any questions about this requirement, please communicate with your department head or with me.  Thanks for your help in implementing this important requirement.

"637 Imbalance Provisions","Lindy, As mentioned in the phonemail message I left, below is a revised listing of the Order 637 Imbalance provisons filed that we want to either retain or potentially trade in 637 negotiations.  I moved the mandatory cash-out provision into the trade column.  Please review and advise if you agree with the list.  Thanks. gh


Already in TW's Tariff

1.	Dollar valuing.  Need to terminate volumetric OBA's where possible to minimize TW's financial exposure.

Proposed in TW's 637 Filing - Keep

1.	Definition of 6 indices (vs. 3 in current tariff).
2.	Parties may mutually agree to cash out PNR.  Could probably do today without this language.
3 .	Clarification that PNR may be used by Operators.
4.	May use PNR for ""auto-balancing"".

Proposed in TW's 637 Filing - Could ""Trade""

1.	Mandatory cash-out each month (after netting and option to trade).
2. 	Daily balancing.  Including daily tolerance, daily auto-transfer to PNR & daily pricing 
3.	Smaller tolerance range.  Proposed change from +/- 10% to +/- 5%.

Please review the attached draft on the TW posting for trading imbalances.
The data is not real imbalance data.I wanted to get a draft out since Glen would be out of the office until Thursday.
Please make any changes to the document & return to me by COB Wednesday, 9/12/01. I will then send a revised final draft out on Thursday and Richard will send the imblance posting document to Toby on Friday afternoon for posting.

"Weekly Report of 1/11/02","California:

CA Legislature.  On Monday Jan. 7th the legislature recovenced and Gov. Davis delivered his State of the State Address on Tuesday.  Davis focused on the projected $12.5 billion budget shortfall and increased education spending.  Gov. Davis pledged he will not advocate increasing taxes and his proposed budget for closing the gap will include a combination of cutbacks, deferred spending, internal borrowing and accelerated revenue.  On Thursday, Assemblyman Herb Wesson, Jr. was elected as Speaker of the Assembly.  Assemblyman Wesson is a Culver City Democrat.  Also on Thursday, Gov. Davis submitted his balanced budget without tax increases.  Key and controversial provisions to cover the shortfall included borrowing from teacher and state worker pension funds, cashing in on future year revenues from the tobacco settlement and spending cuts of $5.2 billion largely from health and welfare programs.  

I99-07-003  SoCalGas Unbundling.  On Jan. 9th SoCalGas held a customer meeting to review their proposed unbundling implementation plan.  This plan will be filed with the CPUC on Jan 17th.  Other key dates included the beginning of the open season for the backbone receipt point capacity which will be held in three phases beginning May 29, 2002, with the third phase ending June 21, 2002 and implementation of transportation under the plan to begin July 1, 2002.  The Core customers were reserved capacity of 313 mmcf/d at Needles.  The remaining capacity of 487.5 mmcf/d will be placed in the open season for bids. 

I00-11-002  Adequacy of SoCal Capacity.  On Monday, the CPUC issued an ALJ ruling requesting parties to submit briefs on the implications of the Unbundling Decision to this proceeding.  Briefs are due January 30, 2002.  Additionally, in the Commissions Infratstructure Report issued last week they cite this system adequacy proceeding as the forum for addressing potential system constraints at two transmission locations (ie San Joaquin and Imperial Valleys).

PG&E Plan of Reorganization.  Along with Enron Corp and Marketing, participated in a conference call regarding PG&E's Plan of Reorganization as related to establishing their backbone system as an InTERstate, open access pipeline.  PG&E is seeking approval of its plan by the Debtors Committee and FERC by mid-2002.  They filed a Section 7(c) Application on Nov. 30, 2001 to establish this interstate company given a temporary name of GTRAN.  During this ""transition"" period current rates remain in effect.  Their plan is to make a Section 4 filing after receiving FERC approval of the current filing.  PG&E requested that Enron and Transwestern file in support of the plan.  No committment was made as we are continuing to evaluate our position.  Interventions are due January 29, 2002.

Note that this does not address capacity release issues.
I think that might be too much for this letter.
I think we should take that up separately.
Probably, an ad hoc basis is best to start with.
For example, I think we should work with Marc of FPU on an individual basis and see what happens.
Then we would be able to feel more confident on whether to call a meeting on this or not.

"Lay It On the Line Survey Results","Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

"RE: *EMCA* EMCA newsletter time","
Dear Julie,

I don't know if this is in time or not. We just got back from camping 
at Enchanted Rock for the long weekend (the kids were off school 
today).

We had our protest hearing for our set-back application on 9/20
before the Planning Commission. There was one property owner
who protested our application, so we had to go to the public hearing.
The short story is that our application was approved and forwarded 
on to City Council, the last step in the process before Peden is
protected from building closer to the street than the average of the 
existing buildings. We applied from Montrose to Taft on both sides 
of Peden. The Planning & Development Dept. (P&DD) records showed 
that we had 76% in favor, and most of the remaining 24% we couldn't
locate to ask to sign before we turned it in. There were two properties
that we slated to be demolished and converted to new townhouses.
With the new set-back in place, new construction is still allowed and
there are no other restriction placed on properties. We're just one step 
away from being protected for 20 years. The guy who protested said
he was planning to tear down two adjacent single story bungalows 
and build townhouses on the double lot. Mike Yates was the co-
applicant, but there was a lot of support and 20% of the signatories 
showed up at the protest hearing! Sorry if this is disjointed, but
I'm really tired from our backpacking and climbing.

Hope this is in time! Let me know if there are any questions.

Carmen

P.S. We saw your van over in Southhampton a couple weeks ago!

"Re: Merry Christmas and Happy New Year","Leon,  I received a phone call from out in the blue
from Asif Hasan.  Asif was Mr. Herring's personal
assistant in the early eighties or maybe even the last
seventies.  Of course I mentioned the HNG Alumni to
Asif and said I would get him on the mailing list. 
His contact information is:

22461 Gravino
Laguna Hills, CA  92653
stocknfund@aol.com
(949)699-6690

He had asked about Gilbert Lafuente and Eddie Garza
and I informed him that they had passed away.  I
couldn't remember all the history from your emails
over the last few years to tell him what has happened.
 Do you keep a log that can be sent out to Asif?  
May God bless everyone this holiday season.

"Enron Board Elects New Corporate Secretary","I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel.

Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant.

Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties.  

Please join me in congratulating Paula on her new responsibilities and in wishing Rebecca well in her future endeavors.

"Travel Security Update","
As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.  
 The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.   
Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website.  
All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance.

"RE: Intercompany Billings Follow-Up","I think a meeting would probably be a good idea as well.  If I understand the Corporate solution properly, I like the idea of having a substantial amount of detail that we can consolidate for rate case purposes, rather than having to go begging when the time comes.  However, we don't want to lose sight of the fact that we will need this kind of detail if and when they do an annual true-up. Also, I am curious as to how allocating EPSC costs to the cost centers would result in a cost savings.  Tim

I haven't heard from Tracy on this.  However, I prefer the option of having epsc charges go to a cost center OR FAR order, depending on how the cost center owner manages assessments.  A meeting would probably be a good opportunity to work through these issues. I'm not sure that everyone (including me) understands all the implications.

Corporate Charges
	Tracy Geaccone has suggested (and discussed with Terry West in Corporate Planning) that the pipelines be allowed access to the 2002 Plan once it has been loaded in SAP for the Corporate cost centers that bill us. The Plan would be recorded by GL account within each of the applicable cost centers.  Corporate prepares a schedule that shows which cost centers bill us, the methodologies used and the amounts billed.  It would be quite an undertaking because of the number of Corporate cost centers involved, but each of the pipelines would be able to derive a FERC breakdown using the Plan, plus the schedule from Corporate.  The main issue would be manpower.  Tracy mentioned the possibility of having one of the associate analysts perform this task, but said that the Plan would not be finalized and loaded until probably the end of November.

	Is this an acceptable solution?  Do we need a meeting to discuss this further?  I am still waiting for return phone calls from Enron Networks and Global Finance.  There are just a few Global Finance cost centers that bill us.  However, the method proposed above may also be a solution for Enron Networks billings.


Enron Property and Services Corp.
	The mandate that these billings be recorded in individual cost centers rather than at a company level originated with Tracy Geaccone with a promise of cost savings to Stan.  However, Tracy told me that rather than coding to a cost center, she has requested that the coding be to a FAR order.  I told her that would mean multiple FAR orders.  Her thinking is that each cost center already has a FAR order.  I attempted to describe our use of custom variants.  She said that she would work through Bob Chandler.  If we intend to continue using the custom variants, it would mean creating a large number of new FAR orders.

	Again, is this an acceptable solution?  Do we need a meeting to discuss this further?

Subject:	SoCalGas BCAP


On Friday, December 28, 2001, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates (""ORA"") filed a motion requesting that the Commission suspend the procedural schedule in the SoCalGas/SDG&E 2003 BCAP.  ORA also requests that the time to respond to its motion be shortened to ten days (Jan. 7).
ORA's motion comes in the wake of the Commission's final decision in the Gas Industry Restructuring proceeding, Decision (""D."") 01-12-018, which was voted out on December 11, 2001.  As you know, that decision adopts the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement (""CSA""), to which Transwestern is a party, with modifications.  SoCalGas and SDG&E have notified the Commission that they will need to file revised BCAP applications (and supporting testimony) to reflect the impact of the CSA.  SoCalGas has not given a date certain for the submission of its revised application, but hopes to provide that information to the Commission by mid-January. SDG&E plans on submitting its revised BCAP application 15 days after SoCalGas makes its filing. 
In its motion, ORA requests that the Commission suspend the procedural schedule in the BCAP, under which ORA is scheduled to submit its ""report"" (direct testimony) on March 22, 2002, until after SoCalGas and SDG&E have submitted their revised applications.  After SoCalGas and SDG&E make their filings, the Commission would convene a second pre-hearing conference to adopt a new procedural schedule. 
It is unlikely SoCalGas will submit its revised BCAP application before the end of January.  If SDG&E takes another 15 days to submit its revised application, that would leave a month, at most, under the current schedule for ORA to prepare its report.  That is not enough time for ORA to get its act together, especially given the two cost allocation methodologies which may be at issue in the BCAP.  Thus, it is very likely the Commission will grant ORA's motion.  At a minimum, the ALJ will establish a new schedule after SoCalGas informs the Commission of the date when it will submit its revised application.  
ORA's motion does not raise any substantive issues.  The fact of the matter is that the procedural schedule in the BCAP is going to slip even more as a result of adoption of the CSA.  How much it will slip primarily depends on how quickly SoCalGas prepares its revised application.  Accordingly, we do not believe it is necessary for Transwestern to respond to ORA's motion.  
Please do not hesitate to call or write if you have any questions.

Please review the attached draft on the TW posting for trading imbalances.
The data is not real imbalance data.I wanted to get a draft out since Glen would be out of the office until Thursday.
Please make any changes to the document & return to me by COB Wednesday, 9/12/01. I will then send a revised final draft out on Thursday and Richard will send the imblance posting document to Toby on Friday afternoon for posting.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
	FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION

Texas Gas Transmission Corporation   				Docket No.
RP01-278-002
                                                      
	NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE FILING

	(October 22, 2001)

Take notice that on October 17, 2001, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First
Revised Volume No. 1, the  following tariff sheets to become effective
October 1, 2001:

                                Primary
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                Sheet No. 184 (reserved)
                                Second Revised Sheet No. 185
                                
                                Alternate
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                
Texas Gas states that this filing is being submitted in compliance with the
Commission's Order issued on September 19, 2001 in the above-referenced
docket.  As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index
price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a
cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the
weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following
month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of
imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above
5%.
However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all
imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level
from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this
tier of imbalance.

Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed
to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington,
D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section
154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not
serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.  Copies of this filing
are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.
This filing may also be viewed on the web at http://www.ferc.gov using the
""RIMS"" link, select ""Docket#"" and follow the instructions  (call
202-208-2222 for assistance).  Comments, protests and interventions may be
filed electronically via the Internet in lieu of paper.  See, 18 CFR
385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructions on the Commission's web site under
the ""e-Filing"" link.

"SoCalGas Complaint (Message from Greg Porter)","

MESSAGE FROM GREG PORTER

________________________________________________
As you know, Transwestern filed a complaint against Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on September 28, 2001.  The complaint asked FERC to find SoCalGas' refusal to pay the tariff commodity rate constitutes a violation of Transwestern's tariff and the 1995 Global Settlement.  SoCalGas filed an Answer on October 18, 2001.  In summary, SoCalGas' Answer stated:

1.	SoCalGas did not affirmatively agree to pay the stated tariff rate during the Global Settlement.  

2.	The commodity charge SoCal has been paying is consistent with the course of performance/conduct prior to, and after, the Global Settlement.  

3.	Since the Global Settlement has been in effect, SoCalGas has relied on the commodity/usage charges that Transwestern has billed.    

4.	SoCalGas claims they had been paying the appropriate rate and that Transwestern failed to include the correct rate in its tariff; such omission has created ambiguity and any ambiguity should be construed against the drafter of the tariff, Transwestern.

5.	If the Commission disagrees with SoCalGas and declines to reject the complaint outright, any retroactive billing adjustment should be limited to a six-month period.

6.	SoCalGas admits that a retroactive billing adjustment for the escalation factor for six months is reasonable and an escalation factor going forward for the remaining term of its Contract No. 8255 is appropriate.

In addition to the foregoing statements, SoCalGas provided that it, like Transwestern, was interested in resolving this matter through ADR.  Accordingly, we will be coordinating with SoCalGas and FERC's ADR group to explore possible ADR procedures.

We will advise as new developments warrant.  In the meantime, should you have any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me at (402) 398-7406 or Maria Pavlou at (402) 398-7097.

"Re: *EMCA* Neighborhood break-ins","To all,

Given today's e-mail traffic, I would like to invite everyone to attend next
month's EMCA meeting.  We will be talking about major projects that we may
want to undertake in the coming year.  I went to the PIP meeting last week
and we discussed the the process involved for setting up an official
citizen's patrol in our neighborhood.  If we, as a group, decide this is
necessary, then we can work with the Storefront to get rained and then the
police will provide us with all of the official signs to post on streets and
patrol cars.  They said  that crime normally shows a significant decrease in
neighborhoods that have taken on the responsibility of a patrol.  Also, my
husband, Bruce Hastings, has volunteered to be the PIP representative this
year, so he will be interested in tracking these trends.

I hope that everyone will try to come on the February 19th for the discussion
of what we want to put on our plate for next year.

See you there!
Cheryl Hastings

"Re: *EMCA* sidewalk: I am the builder","At 09:37 PM 2/12/2002 -0600, you wrote:


Thank you for a very detailed, factual account of your dealings with the City of Houston.  I had a similar experience with city certified contractors.  The city required that we put in a new sewer line: a perfectly legitimate requirement since I knew the little line behind our house frequently backed up when I lived here in the 70's.  But, of course, we had to use a city approved contractor and engineer.  The engineer drew up plans for a line that was at least twice as long as it needed to be.


This means that, if I hadn't noticed it, the contractor would have dug up twice as much of Bomar as he did, or, more likely, he would have charged me for the extra work without doing it, probably splitting the excess charge with the engineer and maybe the city inspector.  When I pointed it out by phone to the engineer (who almost never returned calls from me or our builder) he said not to worry, that he would be here when the city inspector came and would make everything all right.  A friend put me in touch with an e-mail group or small web site maintained by people who had similar problems, and emboldened by their experiences, I finally got him to make the changes by threatening to have his license and his green card revoked.


I attribute many of our problems with city contractors and employees with a contracting and hiring policy that is more concerned with correcting social evils than getting the work done by someone who can do the best job for the lowest cost.

One suggestion.  In Section III, given the reference to all dockets in the related filing, the second sentence should be changed to read:

Subject: Transwestern Response to FERC Data Request - USGT Negotiated Rate Filing



Attached for your review and comments is a draft of TW's response to the FERC data request in the USGT negotiated rate proceeding. Please note that our response to Data Request No. 1, contemplates that we will provide to FERC copies of the other bids that were received on this capacity. We could attempt to summarize this other bids, but I think the better approach is to just provide copies. 

A schedule of actual volumes transported and actual rates charged USGT is attached (this is the Schedule C that is referenced in our response to Data Request No. 4). This will need to be updated next week prior to filing. I do not have the other attachments to the responses in electronic format. I can of course provide paper copies of these to anyone who would like to see them. 

I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon on Monday, December 10. Thanks.

"Re: *EMCA* sidewalk: I am the builder","Martin,
Thanks for the facts.  I am amazed at the lengths you've taken to ""do the right thing"" and greatly appreciate you shedding light on the truth
The homes you built at Welch and Morgan are beautiful and I hope you continue to construct in the Montrose area.  The style, quality and craftsmanship greatly add to the community.  I hope to see more of your work
in the future.
You are the kind of person I'd gladly do business with.

"*EMCA* Fire Trucks at 1001 Bomar","For those of you who saw the two big trucks, rescue vehicle and
ambulance at my house on Sunday and the many of you who have asked:
Thank heaven, all is well!

One of my tenants left something on the stove to run to the store, and
then decided to make another prolonged stop.  The other tenant, the only
one home at the time, smelled something ""really bad"" as she was leaving
to meet  friends and called the fire department.  Firefighters (a total
of four vehicles) arrived in something incredible, like five minutes!
Thanks to her, only the chicken and the pot were casualties.

Which once again proves that the watched pot may not boil, but the
unwatched pot may go up in smoke.

"Summary of SoCalGas Unbundling Customer Meeting","At the meeting yesterday, SoCalGas outlined their plan for implementing the unbundling of their backbone system including a proposed timeline which will be filed at the CPUC on Jan. 17, 2002.  Lad Lorenz state that the proposal is ""not cast in concrete"" and invited comments at the meeting as well as in response to the filing.  However as you might expect, when some customers expressed their concern with the timeline being too short, SoCal made no offer to push some of the dates out into the future and stuck with their proposal.  All of the proposed dates are their best estimate for timing as variables such as the system requirements may cause delays and rescheduling of some portions of the implementation plan.  Key items and dates are as follows:

Jan. 17		SoCalGas files its proposed Implementation Plan and timeline.

Feb. 14		Meeting with CPUC Energy Staff and Interested Parties.  Tariff Workshop.

Feb. 22		SoCalGas files tariffs including a definition of Annual Average Usage for existing end-use customers.
		This definition is important as it determines their capacity rights in the Open Season.	

Mar. 15		50 mmcf/d of capacity at North Needles to be placed into service.

May 6		Distribution of informational packages on Backbone Receipt Point Rights to customers.

May 29		Begin Phase I of the Open Season.

June 5		Phase I Open Season ends.  See Slides 55 through 57 for all other Open Season dates.

June 22		SoCal will post awarded receipt point capacity.

July 1		Implementation of unbundling the backbone receipt point services.

Slide 13		Indicates North Needles has 800 mmcf/d of capacity
		This was described as ""primarily Transwestern""

Slide 15		The Core backbone receipt point capacity at Needles is set at 313 mmcf/d.

I'm faxing an entire copy of the presentation to Marketing and Regulatory Affairs for distribution and review.  Slides 11-21 describe the Backbone Receipt Services and Slides 50-63 provide the proposed timeline for implementation.  Please give me a call if you have any questions about SoCal's proposal.  gh

"Merry Christmas and Happy New Year","Well, 2001 has truly been an unusual year for many of us -- some things good and some not so good.  Whatever your own situation, I just wanted to say to you that I hope that you do have a very Merry Christmas, and hopefully, a wonderful and happy 2002.

We plan to continue our HNG Alumni luncheons in the Spring and Fall of 2002, but just do not have any definite plans as to how we will be able to communicate and mail to you as we have in the past.  The situation at Enron has affected our organization also.

Will look forward to seeing you in the Spring.

Leon Ullrich

"Re: *EMCA* sidewalks","The property is on th southwest corner of Welch and Morgan (400 block).  There
are big new townhouses.  I would guess that the plans have been approved by the
City, prior to building.  Two things that we need to keep in mind.  This
property was abandoned building s prior to the new development, and there was
no visible existing sidewalks on Welch or Morgan before the new construction
began.  In fact, the plants that were growing there were offered for the taking
prior to construction.  Also, if you drive by, you will notice a grand old tree
in the public right-of-way, and it would be very difficult to put in a standard
sidewalk without killing the tree.

However, if you want to reach the proper City department to doublecheck, you
can call 311 and they will get you to the right people.

"Re: *EMCA* Look at www.eastmontrose.org","Wow!  EMCA is really getting serious about this communication thing!  Maybe there's a way we can also turn this to use in security matters. 

Speaking of which, Capt. Yorek, who heads Central Division, of which we are a tiny part, and I were at a luncheon together yesterday.  He was there to talk about the month-long anti-vice sweep they ran.  They were particularly trying to break up teenage prostitution and dope dealing in the Neartown neighborhoods.  They made 100 arrests.  They are now doing follow-up sweeps.  He also said that they are trying to cut down the rampant auto burglaries going on in our area.  Emphasized to park under lights where possible and to not leave anything in sight in your car.  We had a car break-in at my house only this week.  They are also working with our storefront to try to reduce graffiti, which has again been very active.

"Enron Center South Occupancy","This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

My thought is that the Enron contract is probably going away anyhow so that it makes sense to set this up for Jan 1.  I think the charges should be recorded to the balancing tools account.

I finally got a price quote of $1990 per year on a package deal for one user.  Platts doesn't sell the data without a subsciption to the daily publication. The package includes the daily issues and data(table) and back issues and data. 

Please let me know if you want me to go ahead and sign up for this package. I'll have to let Platts know the user's name and billing information etc...

Thanks.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"FPU","Chris Snyder with FPU called and asked if the New Smyrna point, poi 16160 on contract 100740 (which is the only delivery point on that contract that they permanently acquired through capacity release) could be made a division.  The point was acquired through a permanent capacity release transaction as a single point. 

The problem is that they requested to combine this point into their current dpoa, contract 5002 that has points behind divisions.  The allocation reports he gets do not reflect this point since it is not in a division.  Can we make a point a division just so the reports can ""pick up"" the point?  Chris also mentioned that he does not want this point in a separate dpoa because he wants to be able to take advantage of the section 11 rights with their other delivery points on their dpoa.  

Frazier and Teb, please let me know if we can do this so that we can make the appropriate changes in our system.  nb

"ETS and Corporate Change Control","The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Feb. 13
From 5:00 p.m.  through 2/14 at 6:00 a.m., the Envision team will perform hardware maintenance on the Envision system.  This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices. 
Feb. 14	
At 12:00 noon, Enron Network Services will disable advertisement of the 172.29.0.0 networks on the OmahaCisco router.  This is to prevent unwanted traffic from routing through Northern Border.  No impact is expected.
Feb. 15
Beginning today, the Application Scripting team will modify the script for Instant messanger to allow parameters.  No impact is expected.

Feb. 15
From 10:30 - 11:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will fail over Internet traffic to the primary firewall.  This change will result in a 10-15 second outage for Internet traffic and access to servers on the 192.189.171.0 and 65.201.84.0 DMZ segments.  This change will be coordinated with HotTap and will not take place until processing is completed.  Support staff with application servers on the DMZ should plan on testing their applications after this change.

Feb. 16
From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.  This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.  LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.

"Cat Tale","I forwarded this to a number of people yesterday but most didn't get it, so 
I'm sending again. It's long so you may want to print out and read later.
Love,
S.
A Cat's Tale... 


This is the story of the night my ten-year-old cat, Rudy, got his head stuck 
in the garbage disposal. I  knew at the time that the experience would be 
funny if the cat survived, so let me tell you right up front that he's fine. 


Getting him out wasn't easy, though, and the process included numerous home 
remedies, a plumber, two cops, an emergency overnight veterinary clinic, a 
case of mistaken identity, five hours of panic, and fifteen minutes of fame. 


First, some background. My husband, Bill, and I had just returned from a 
five-day spring-break vacation in the Cayman Islands, where I had been sick 
as a dog the 

whole time, trying to convince myself that if I had to feel lousy, it was 
better to do it in paradise. 


We had arrived home at 9 PM, a day and a half later than we had planned 
because of airline problems. I still had illness-related vertigo, and because 
of the flight delays, had not been able to prepare the class I was supposed 
to teach at 8:40 the next morning. I sat down at my desk to think about 
William Carlos Williams, and around ten o'clock I heard Bill hollering 
something undecipherable from the kitchen. 


As I raced out to see what was wrong, I saw Bill frantically rooting around 
under the kitchen sink and Rudy, or rather, Rudy's headless body, scrambling 
around in the sink, his claws clicking in panic on the metal. 


Bill had just ground up the skin of some smoked salmon in the garbage 
disposal, and when he left the room, Rudy (whom we always did call a pinhead) 
had gone in 

after it. 


It is very disturbing to see the headless body of your cat in the sink. This 
is an animal that I have slept with nightly for ten years, who burrows under 
the covers and purrs against my side, and who now looked like a desperate, 
fur-covered turkey carcass, set to defrost in the sink while it's still alive 
and kicking. It was also disturbing to see Bill, Mr. Calm-in-any-Emergency, 
at his wits end, trying to 

soothe Rudy, trying to undo the garbage disposal, failing at both, and 
basically freaking out. 


Adding to the chaos was Rudy's twin brother Lowell, also upset, racing around 
in circles, jumping onto the kitchen counter and alternately licking Rudy's 
butt for comfort and biting it out of fear. Clearly, I had to do something. 


First we tried to ease Rudy out of the disposal by lubricating his head and 
neck. We tried Johnson's baby shampoo (kept on hand for my nieces visits) and 
butter-flavored Crisco: both failed, and a now-greasy Rudy kept struggling. 


Bill then decided to take apart the garbage disposal, which was a good idea, 
but he couldn't do it. Turns out, the thing is constructed like a metal 
onion: you peel off one layer and another one appears, with Rudy's head still 
buried deep inside, stuck in a hard plastic collar. My job during this 
process was to sit on the kitchen counter petting Rudy, trying to calm him, 
with the room spinning (vertigo), Lowell howling (he's part Siamese), and 
Bill clattering around with tools. 


When all our efforts failed, we sought professional help. I called our 
regular plumber, who actually called me back quickly, even at 11 o'clock at 
night (thanks, Dave). He talked Bill through further layers of disposal 
dismantling, but still we couldn't reach Rudy. I called the 1-800 number for 
Insinkerator (no response), a pest removal service that advertises 24-hour 
service (no response), an all-night emergency veterinary clinic (who had no 
experience in this matter, and so, no advice), and finally, in desperation, 
911. I could see that Rudy's normally pink paw pads were turning blue. The 
fire department, I figured, gets cats out of trees; maybe they could get one 
out of a garbage disposal. 


The dispatcher had other ideas and offered to send over two policemen. This 
suggestion gave me pause. I'm from the sixties, and even if I am currently a 
fine 

upstanding citizen, I had never considered calling the cops and asking them 
to come to my house, on purpose.  I resisted the suggestion, but the 
dispatcher was 

adamant: ""They'll help you out,"" he said. 


The cops arrived close to midnight and turned out to be quite nice. More 
importantly, they were also able to think rationally, which we were not. 


They were, of course, quite astonished by the situation: ""I've never seen 
anything like this,"" Officer Mike kept saying. (The unusual circumstances 
helped us get quickly on a first-name basis with our cops.) 


Officer Tom expressed immediate sympathy for our plight. ""I have had cats all 
my life,"" he said, comfortingly. Also he had an idea. Evidently we needed a 
certain tool, a tiny, circular rotating saw that could cut through the heavy 
plastic flange encircling Rudy's neck without hurting Rudy, and Officer Tom 
happened to own one. ""I live just five minutes from here,"" he said; ""I'll go 
get it."" 


He soon returned, and the three of them, Bill and the two policemen got under 
the sink together to cut through the garbage disposal. I sat on the counter, 
holding Rudy and trying not to succumb to the surreal-ness of the scene, with 
the weird 

middle-of-the-night lighting, the rooms occasional spinning, Lowell's spooky 
sound effects, an apparently headless cat in my sink and six disembodied legs 
poking out from under it. One good thing came of this:  the guys did manage 
to get the bottom of the disposal, so we could now see Rudy's face and knew 
he could 

breathe. But they couldn't cut the flange without risking the cat. 


Stumped, Officer Tom had another idea. ""You know,"" he said, ""I think the 
reason we can't get him out is the angle of his head and body. If we could 
just get the 

sink out and lay it on its side, I'll bet we could slip him out."" That 
sounded like a good idea at this point, ANYTHING would have sounded like a 
good idea and as it turned out, Officer Mike runs a plumbing business on 
weekends; he knew how to take out the sink! Again they went to work, the 
three pairs of legs sticking out from under the sink surrounded by an 
ever-increasing pile of tools and sink parts. They cut the electrical supply, 
capped off the plumbing lines, unfastened the metal clamps, unscrewed all the 
pipes, and about an hour later, voila! The sink was lifted gently out of the 
countertop, with one guy holding the garbage disposal (which contained Rudy's 
head) up close to the sink (which contained Rudy's body). We laid the sink on 
its side, but even at this more favorable removal angle, Rudy stayed stuck. 


Officer Tom's radio beeped, calling him away on some kind of real police 
business. As he was leaving, though, he had another good idea: ""You know,"" he 
said, 

""I don't think we can get him out while he's struggling so much. We need to 
get the cat sedated. If he were limp, we could slide him out."" And off he 
went, regretfully, a cat lover still worried about Rudy. 


The remaining three of us decided that getting Rudy sedated was a good idea, 
but Bill and I were new to the area. We knew that the overnight emergency 

veterinary clinic was only a few minutes away, but we didn't know exactly how 
to get there. ""I know where it is!"" declared Officer Mike. ""Follow me!"" 


So Mike got into his patrol car, Bill got into the drivers seat of our car, 
and I got into the back, carrying the kitchen sink, what was left of the 
garbage disposal, and Rudy. 


It was now about 2:00 a.m. We followed Officer Mike for a few blocks when I 
decided to put my hand into the garbage disposal to pet Rudy's face, hoping I 

could comfort him. Instead, my sweet, gentle bedfellow chomped down on my 
finger, hard, really hard and wouldn't let go. My scream reflex kicked into 
gear, 

and I couldn't stop the noise. Bill slammed on the breaks, hollering ""What? 
What happened? Should I stop?"" checking us out in the rear view mirror. 


""No,"" I managed to get out between screams, ""just keep driving. Rudy's biting 
me, but we've got to get to the vet. Just go!"" 


Bill turned his attention back to the road, where Officer Mike took a turn we 
hadn't expected, and we followed. After a few minutes Rudy let go, and as I 

stopped screaming, I looked up to discover that we were wandering aimlessly 
through an industrial park, in and out of empty parking lots, past little 
streets 

that didn't look at all familiar. ""Where's he taking us?"" I asked. ""We should 
have been there ten minutes ago!"" 


Bill was as mystified as I was, but all we knew to do was follow the police 
car until, finally, he pulled into a church parking lot and we pulled up next 
to him. 


As Bill rolled down the window to ask Mike ""where are we going?"" the cop, who 
was not Mike, rolled down his window and asked, ""Why are you following me?"" 
Once Bill and I recovered from our shock at having tailed the wrong cop car 
and the policeman from his pique at being stalked, led us quickly to the 
emergency vet, where Mike greeted us by holding open the door, exclaiming, 
""Where were you guys?"" 


It was lucky that Mike got to the vets ahead of us, because we hadn't thought 
to call and warn them about what was coming. (Clearly, by this time we 
weren't 

really thinking at all.) We brought in the kitchen sink containing Rudy and 
the garbage disposal containing his head, and the clinic staff was ready. 
They took his temperature (which was down 10-degrees) and his oxygen level 
(which was half of normal), and the vet declared: ""This cat is in serious 
shock. We've got to sedate him and get him out of there immediately."" 


When I asked if it was OK to sedate a cat in shock, the vet said grimly, ""We 
don't have a choice."" With that, he injected the cat; Rudy went limp; and the 
vet 

squeezed about half a tube of K-Y jelly onto the cat's neck and pulled him 
free. 


Then the whole team jumped into code blue mode. (I know this from watching a 
lot of ER) They laid Rudy on a cart, where one person hooked up IV fluids, 
another 

put little socks on his paws (""You'd be amazed how much heat they lose 
through their pads,"" she said), one covered him with hot water bottles and a 
blanket, 

and another took a blow-dryer to warm up Rudy's now very gunky head. The fur 
on his head dried in stiff little spikes, making him look rather pathetically 
punk as he lay there, limp and motionless. 


At this point they sent Bill, Mike, and me to sit in the waiting room while 
they tried to bring Rudy back to life. I told Mike he didn't have to stay, 
but he just stood there, shaking his head. ""I've never seen anything like 
this,"" he said again. 


At about 3 AM, the vet came in to tell us that the prognosis was good for a 
full recovery. They needed to keep Rudy overnight to re-hydrate him and give 
him 

something for the brain swelling they assumed he had, but if all went well, 
we could take him home the following night. 


Just in time to hear the good news, Officer Tom rushed in, finished with his 
real police work and concerned about Rudy. I figured that once this ordeal 
was over 

and Rudy was home safely, I would have to re-think my position on the police. 


Bill and I got back home about 3:30. We hadn't unpacked from our trip, I was 
still intermittently dizzy, and I still hadn't prepared my 8:40 class. ""I 
need a vacation,"" I said, and while I called the office to leave a message 
canceling my class, Bill 

made us a pitcher of martinis. I slept late the next day and then badgered 
the vet about Rudy's condition until he said that Rudy could come home later 
that day. 


I was working on the suitcases when the phone rang. ""Hi, this is Steve Huskey 
from the Norristown Times-Herald,"" a voice told me. ""Listen, I was just going 
through the police blotter from last night.  Mostly it's the usual stuff: 
Breaking and entering, petty theft but there's this one item. Um, do you have 
a cat?"" So I told Steve the whole story, which interested him. A couple hours 
later he called back to 

say that his editor was interested, too; did I have a picture of Rudy? The 
next day Rudy was front-page news, under the ridiculous headline Catch of the 
Day Lands Cat in Hot Water. 


There were some noteworthy repercussions to the newspaper article. Mr. Huskey 
had somehow inferred that I called 911 because I thought Bill, my husband, 
was going into shock, although how he concluded this from my comment that his 
pads were turning blue, I don't quite understand. So the first thing I had to 
do was call Bill at work. Bill, who had worked tirelessly to free Rudy--and 
swear that I had been misquoted.  When I arrived at work myself, I was 
famous; people had been calling my secretary all morning to inquire about 
Rudy's health. 


When I called our regular vet (whom I had met only once) to make a follow-up 
appointment for Rudy, the receptionist asked, ""Is this the famous Rudy's 
mother?"" When I brought my car in for routine maintenance a few days later, 
Dave, my mechanic, said, ""We read about your cat. Is he OK?"" When I called a 
tree surgeon about my dying red oak, he asked if I knew the person on that 
street whose cat had been in the garbage disposal. 


And when I went to get my hair cut, the shampoo person told me the funny 
story her grandma had read in the paper, about a cat that got stuck in the 
garbage 

disposal. Even today, over a year later, people ask about Rudy, whom a 
9-year-old neighbor had always called the Adventure Cat because he used to 
climb on 

the roof of her house and peer in the second-story window at her. 


I don't know what the moral of this story is, but I do know that this 
adventure cost me $1100 in emergency vet bills, follow-up vet care, a new 
sink, new plumbing, new electrical wiring, and a new garbage disposal, one 
with a cover. The vet can no longer say he's seen everything but the kitchen 
sink. I wanted to thank Officers Tom and Mike by giving them gift 
certificates to the local hardware store, but was told that they couldn't 
accept gifts, that I would put them in a bad position if I tried. So I wrote 
a letter to the Police Chief praising their good deeds and sent 

individual thank-you notes to Tom and Mike, complete with pictures of Rudy, 
so they could see what he looks like with his head on. And Rudy, whom we 
originally 

got for free (or so we thought), still sleeps with me under the covers on 
cold nights and unaccountably, he still sometimes prowls the sink, hoping for 
fish...

I am not familiar with the deal, but if the path is something different than East of Thoreau to Calif, the fuel rate is above max which I would think would qualify is as a neg rate transaction.  I would suggest talking to Teb Lokey regarding the actual filing as his shop will be making this filing.

"Segmented Backhauls","The Commission addressed the backhaul issue in Order Nos. 637-A and 637-B.
Bottom line is that backhaul and forward haul cannot overlap.
However, new development is full CD forward haul and full CD backhaul can be delivered at same point.

Here is what the Commission said in Order No. 637-A:

EXAMPLE:

Points:  M	A	N	O	P	Q	R	B			S
_______________________________________________________________________________________

		>>>>10,000 FORWARD>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<10,000 BACKHAUL<

	""Both the releasing and replace shippers also would retain the flexibility to use their capacity fully to make backhauls.  Thus, the shipper could deliver 10,000 Dth from point A to Point B using forward haul capacity and 10,000 Dth from point S to point B using a backhaul, because there is no overlap over the mainline.
	This may require a change by some pipeline with respect to their tariffs regarding backhauls.  The Commission's policy on the use of forwardhauls and backhauls to the same pont in excess of contract demand has been in the process of change.  While the Commission found in 1997 that a shipper cannot use the same delivery point for a forwardhaul and backhaul in excess of contract demand, the Commission recently found that a forwardhaul and backhaul to a series of 23 meter station considered as a single point for nomination purposes did not result in a capacity overlap even though the total amount received by the shipper exceeded contract demand.  In order to promote shippers' ability to use their capacity as flexibly as possible, the Commission has determined that prior restrictions on shippers' use of forwardhauls and backhauls to the same point should not be followed.  Shippers' segmentation right should not depend on metaphysical distinctions between delivery to a single point or to two points adjacent to each other.  In both situations, shippers should be permitted to use a forwardhaul and a backhaul to deliver gas as long as the mainline contract demand is not exceeded and they can take delivery of the gas.""  (Footnotes omitted.)

In Order No. 637-B, the Commission addressed requests of INGAA, Williams and the El Paso pipelines for rehearing of this very point. The Commission denied rehearing, repeating much of what it had said in Order No. 637-A.


NOTE:  Seems like there is more than a ""metaphysical"" difference between deliveries to a single point versus two points.  However, the Commission does recognize that there may be a physical constraint, and maybe even a scheduling constraint.

Subject:	ETS' TW Teams Appreciation Luncheon - Last Round


Because a large number of our invitees had conflicting schedules, we are moving the date of our Appreciation Luncheon for the LAST TIME!!! 

This will be our last attempt to accommodate everyone.  Trust me, the food and games at Jillians will be well worth your patience.

Steve's main objective was to include as many of  ETS' TW Teams as possible.  We feel that Friday,  the 5th of October would better suit the majority of our teams.  

We thank you for your patience and please respond by September 26.

Subject:	Re: Transwestern Record Storage at Iron Mountain (Omaha)

Teb, As we discussed, the Omaha Iron Mountain storage facility contains some 198 boxes of Transwestern documents. These documents came from Transwestern/Houston originally and related to old certificate and rate filings. Because of the pending acquisition of Northern by Dynegy, Northern needs to isolate our storage records. Consequently, were asking you to retrieve and take ownership of the 198 boxes from the Omaha IM facility. This will involve having Houston Iron Mountain initiating the request for shipping from the Omaha facility and being responsible for the disposition of the boxes when they are received. The estimated shipping costs to Transwestern for the boxes would be approx. $2,200 - $2,400 . The box numbers for the Transwestern records were previously provided to you by letter dated 8/10/01. In addition, would you please provide me your cost center #, company #, GL account # and material # so that the box retrieval fee ($1/box) charged to Northern's account by the Omaha Iron Mountain facility can be cross-charged to Transwestern ? 

If you have any questions or if I can assist in facilitating this request, please give me a call. 
Thanks, 
Bob Thurber

Subject: Quote for the day, #1,203.


""If nothing else, John Walker has usefully nailed one of the self-serving myths peddled after the awesome intelligence failure of September 11th: Awfully sorry we failed to see it coming, said the high-ranking suits, but it's impossible to do any covert deep-cover stuff out in Afghanistan; these fellows are all cousins and brothers-in-law -- a guy from Jersey would stick out like a lap-dancer in a burqa. As we now know, instead of being full of fearsome Pashtun warriors renowned down the centuries, the Omar/Osama ranks were like a novelty Gap ad, 'Losers of Many Nations' -- misfit Saudis and Pakis, Brits and Californians. Anyone can walk in off the street and be assistant supervisor of the third-floor latrine in Tora Bora by nightfall. The only distinguishing feature about John Walker is that he's such an obvious compendium of clapped-out clich?s from America's Left Coast the wonder is the mullahs didn't automatically take him for a CIA plant.
 
But no, Mr. Walker is for real -- born John Lindh in 1981, and from that bastion of well-heeled  dopehead progressivism, California's affluent Marin County. Following the traditional Marin pattern, his parents divorced, his mother converted to Buddhism and the children were taught Native American spirituality. John was sent to an 'alternative' high school. (In the Bay Area, all the high schools are 'alternative.' The problem for parents is trying to find any alternative to the alternative.) The set texts included The Autobiography Of Malcolm X, and John liked it so much that like the late Mr. X he too decided to embrace Islam and change his name, to Sulayman. His parents, putting their foot down for what seems to be the first and last time, demanded the right to continue calling him John. They had, after all, gone to the trouble of naming him after one of the colossi of the age, John Lennon. To this, he
 consented. In return, they let him study at the Mill Valley Islamic Center.
 
In 1998, after an awkward trip to their ancestral Ireland in which John trudged dutifully round the auld sod wearing his turban and white robes, Frank Lindh agreed to let his 17-year old son spend a year in Yemen, on the next stage of his 'spiritual odyssey.' He was just another middle-class kid who'd gone off to find himself, but, like most of the others, he always knew how to find daddy when he needed to. Last year, John e-mailed home to say al-Qaeda's attack on the USS Cole was justified -- oh, and by the way he was off to enroll in a Pakistani madrassa. So Dad wired him a couple thousand bucks, which goes a long way in Bannu. Aside from a glowing school report from his Imam, that was the last Mr. Lindh heard from Junior until he turned up brandishing an AK-47 while battling U.S. armed forces and declaring his approval of the events of September 11th.
 
John Walker's CV bears eloquent testament to his parents' scrupulous observance of the Bay Area's First Commandment: 'Thou shalt be non-judgmental.' Yeah, man, Yemen. Cool. Whatever's your bag. As one headline put it: 'A Product Of Bay Area Culture.' Exactly, I thought. But, this being The San Francisco Chronicle, they were applying the label with pride. Rhapsodizing about the area's 'religious tolerance' and the way children are taught 'to accept other cultures' and value 'critical thinking about the U.S. role in the world,' senior writer Louis Freedberg concluded that Walker's only misfortune was that 'his search for identity intersected precisely with the World Trade Center attacks.' If not for this unfortunate 'intersection' Walker might have become an 'idealistic doctor.' The President, he said, should allow the boy home 'and let him get his life back on track. We'd want nothing less for our own children, who could easily have found themselves in a similar mess.'
 
In fairness to the youth of northern California, that last part is an unjust slur. The marvel is that, after labouring under the twin burdens of the education system's multicultural orthodoxies and the preening moral superiority of their Boomer parents, no more Bay Area teens have signed on with Mullah Omar. Nonetheless, there is a difference between 'tolerance' of other cultures and the moral inertia displayed  by the Lindhs. We can, in any case, guess the limits of Marin County's much-vaunted 'tolerance.' Imagine that the Marinated Muslim had instead announced that he was going to do what the late (CIA agent) Mike Spann did at his age: enlist in the Marines. Would Marilyn Walker have seen that as a valid part of her son's 'self-discovery'? Or would she have got out her joss sticks and wailed, 'Oh, my God, where did we go wrong?'
 
Mom says she's 'proud' of John, but is taking the line he must have been 'brainwashed.' From the look of him, his brain's the only thing that's been washed. John Walker resembles one of those hairy, smelly, cadaverous, vaguely deranged guys who stumble up to you late at night at remote Greyhound stations and demand money for medication. But right now that's shrewd image-positioning. President Bush seems to have bought the 'misguided' line, describing Walker as a 'poor fellow' who thought he was fighting for a 'great cause.' 'I can't see him as being unpatriotic,' says a neighbour. 'This is where his journey led him.' And, anyway, as everyone says, he's just a 'boy.'
 
John Walker is a 20-year old man -- though one can sympathize if protracted exposure to the Bay Area's 'critical thinking' (if only) has left him in a state of arrested development. For four decades, supposedly 'non-judgmental' flower-children like Marilyn Walker have reflexively characterized CIA men like Mike Spann as the dark agents of right-wing militarism. We are entitled to judge Marilyn's son, the comrade of Spann's killers, as the dark agent of left-wing Marinism. Raised by peaceniks and Marinated in 'tolerance,' he took up an AK-47 in defence of misogynists and gay-bashers: not an internal contradiction, but the logical reductio of the new left's moral nullity. Cocooned in one of the most prosperous enclaves on the planet, he was taught everything -- from Buddhism to Indian spirituality to Malcolm X -- everything except what it means to be an American citizen.
 
When a 13-year-old girl wants an abortion, the Marin County crowd insists that 'a woman's right to choose is sacred (and even parental notification taboo). Twenty-year-old men make choices, too. John Walker chose to go to war against his own country. Americans should respect his 'right to choose' and let him live with the consequences.
 
I'm not in favour of trying him for treason: Alan Dershowitz and the other high-rent lawyers are already salivating over the possibility of a two-year circus with attendant book deals and TV movies. But there is another way, suggested the other day by the Sun's Peter Worthington. In 1944, lacking the benefits of an immersion in Bay Area 'critical thinking,' the teenage Worthington volunteered for the Royal Canadian Navy, but, unlike Walker's apologists, he at least treats him as an adult exercising free will. As Mr. Worthington notes, on page four of John Walker's U.S. passport it states that any American who enlists in a foreign army can be stripped of his citizenship. Mr. Walker wants to be Abdul Hamid: Mr. Bush should honour his wishes. Let us leave him to the Northern Alliance and let his fancy-pants 'Frisco lawyers petition to appear before the Kabul bar, if there is one. It would, surely, be grossly discriminatory to subject Mr. Hamid to non-Islamic justice.""

"EGS & the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation","The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk is scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28, at Greenspoint Mall. 

Approximately 35 children are diagnosed with diabetes each day.  Even with insulin, this disease results in a drastic reduction in quality of life and shortens the average life span by 15 years.  

Enron has been the #1 walk team for the Texas Gulf Coast for 6 years in a row, and we need walkers and volunteers to help us continue this tradition.  

EGS' goal this year is to raise $20,000, and we need your help. To participate, donate $5 to any JDRF Team Captain and receive a shoe to be displayed at the Big E Cafe on Friday, October 26.  A donation of $25 entitles you to a t-shirt and a shoe at the Big E Cafe. All donations will be matched by Enron.

Business unit pledge totals can be viewed on the JDRF race track located in the lobby. 

For more information on Juvenile Diabetes, visit the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation <http://www.jdf.org>. 

To make your donation, please contact one of EGS' JDRF Team Captains:

Subject:	update to TW meas. audits

Gents:  we've audited approx. 33 measurement stations in the past 3 months; the attached spreadsheet 
contains only the ""open"" issues, yet to be resolved.  We think we identified the ""culprit"" for TW excess uaf 
with the leaking valve issue at Bloomfield Hub; keep in mind that was resolved on 7/10/01. 

 
 
 July (total system) was a +93,332 mcf gain====0.16%
 August (total system) was a +67,996 mcf gain = 0.11% 

We think the TW uaf numbers are holding around zero (+/- 0.1%); for August, the segments look very ""tight"":

	West Texas Lateral===TO1===13,380 mcf gain===0.04%
	Panhandle Lateral====TO2===23,074 mcf gain===0.63%
	Mainline Lateral======TO3===31,524 mcf gain===0.06%

If stations would hold steady flows, maybe we could identify some type of trend; but, they don't==they're
up and down, on and off====therefore, each station has bias that can swing the uaf (+ or -) around zero.

Our next plan was to audit stations with volumes between 10,000 and 50,000 mcf/day (approx. 25 stations);  
our question is ==== do we continue with the plan, or let it ride for a couple of months and see what happens??
These audits consume a lot of time for all involved, so we're looking for work direction===

Your suggestions, comments plz

"RE: OBA & Scheduling Alt FT by Price Tariff Filings","I've scheduled the OBA meeting for Tuesday, Dec. 18th at 1:30 PM in conference room 1336 in Houston and conf. room 724 in Omaha.

Subject:	OBA & Scheduling Alt FT by Price Tariff Filings

In an effort to get cash in the door for TW and to maximize revenue opportunity for TW in the coming year, I think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the FERC as soon as possible. 

One would be the OBA filing we have been discussing (and trying to support with historical data) to get automatic cash-out on OBA's in ""constrained"" areas on TW.

Second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate FT points.  This may be the time (the market to California is not so hot) to try to implement this.  I know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them.  

Glen is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the OBA tariff filing.  Could we discuss scheduling alternate FT by price at the same meeting?

"Credit Union Changes","What's Next for
Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.

Subject:	RE: TW Overhead WO

We can charge directly but still need some guidance.  For example, it is my understanding that there are 4 WO set up for Red Rock - one for each station to be modified.  Our work is of a general nature, so do we have to further subdivide our charges to each of the stations, or to three of the stations.  Also, some of our time is spent on a general analysis of regulatory strategy involving all capital projects, and it seems like the overhead WO would be appropriate for these charges.  We don't necessarily want to have to have each person charge to 3 or 4 WO for each identifiable capital project and then to 10 or more WO for our general work.  Any specific suggestions, WO numbers, etc. ?

"RE: SFTS conversions","I agree with Teb.
(I have programed my e-mail so that this is always the opening line.)

The FTS-1 remains FTS-1 the entire time period.  It does not convert back to SFTS.  Chattahoochee is simply holds all FTS-1 rights and obligations between releases.  There is no requirement regarding time periods between releases.  The only requirements regarding time is the limitation that switches from SFTS to FTS-1 and FTS-1 to SFTS cannot be sooner than 12 months.  (Sheet No 31.)

If Chattahoochee converted all of their SFTS  to FTS-1 for the purpose of release, there is no problem with a gap.  If they still hold any SFTS,  they cannot have FTS-1 capacity at the same time, even for 1 month.

Subject:	SFTS conversions
Importance:	High

I have a question about the SFTS conversions that were done a while back so that the customer could utilize our capacity release program.  I noticed that The City of Chattahoochee converted their SFTS to FTS-1 and that the temporary acquisitions on their FTS-1 have a gap.  More specifically, they have a release in place for 10/1/02 thru 4/30/03 and the next release begins 10/1/03 thru 4/30/04.  Do the releases have to be consecutive in order for them to retain their conversion to FTS-1?  Because they will not have a release in place for May thru Sept. of 2003 according to their releases.  Is this wrong?  I haven't checked to see if this occurs on any of the other coversions and will if this is an issue.  Please advise.  nb

"*EMCA* City lot size ordinance","Hello all,  Lorraine and I have been unable to get ourselves down to 
the meetings lately.  Being new parents has us pretty exhausted but 
we are getting the hang of it.  Tyler James is growing so fast.  
Maybe next month we will make it.  

Anyway, we did have a question about the newly adopted city lot size 
ordinance that was passed in December.  Is there something printed 
that specifically addresses how this affects our neighborhood?  Do we 
know what the average lot size is in Montrose?  Does this mean that 
no more old classic homes can be torn down to build 3 townhomes?

Also, we were wondering if anyone has noticed the parking problems 
lately due to the Eclesiastic church on Taft?  They seem to provide 
no parking for their events which seem to occur more often every 
month.  They have done alot of work on that church and I have never 
noticed one single permit posted on their structure.  We don't really 
know these people and have nothing against them but don't they need 
to comply with city parking and building codes?

Maybe these issues can be addressed in next months newsletter?

Subject:	Data for Comments and for Economist's Report

In order to give some concrete statistics for our argument that midstream and  production affiliates are important links in the infrastructure with affiliated  pipelines (and, of course, that applying the NOPR to pipeline affiliates would  be a disaster), please provide data to answer the following three questions. Our  customer operations guys tell me this is a pretty straigtforward exercise.O bviously, given the 13 days until comments are due, time is of the essence. So  please respond by COB Tuesday, if possible.
1. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that receive gas  from an affiliated interstate pipeline? For all these interconnects, how much  gas flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000?
2. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that receive gas  from affiliated gatherers, processors, or intrastate pipelines? For all these  interconnects, how much gas flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000?
3. For each pipeline, how many interconnects do you have that deliver gas  into affiliated intrastate pipelines? For all these interconnects, how much gas  flowed through them (in the aggregate) in 2000?
Additionally, Michael Doane, the economist INGAA has retained, would like to  have the following information for his report. It can be anecdotal, but having  something concrete to point at is critical. He needs all the examples we can  provide of existing infrastructure (gathering-to-pipeline,  processing-to-pipeline, production-to-affiliated gathering and pipeline) that  would not have gone forward if pipelines were not allowed to coordinate with  their midstream and production affiliates. If at all possible, state the natural  gas deliverability that's there today, which would not have been there. under  the proposed rule.
As you'd suspect, this also has to be done as quickly as possible. Get the  information to me, and I'll forward it to Michael.
Thanks for your help.

In reading the messages below, Teb is correct in that Chris can trade any real imbalances between any of his firm or DPOA contracts.  However, if both firm contracts are on one DPOA, then any market area delivery imbalances created on either of his firm contracts will be summarized together on the one DPOA contract and become a single market area delivery imbalance available for trade with any other entity with an offsetting market area delivery imbalance.   Also, cash out will be calculated using the summarized DPOA market area delivery imbalance quantity net of any offsetting trades.  I do not see that Chris will have two balancing entities to deal with if both firm agreements are tied to one DPOA contract (as Nancy has stated below).   Jim

The way the dpoa is set up now is the way it would be reflected if the two contracts were combined.  However, if the contracts are combined, does that mean that we would make the point a division?  If so, the problem is solved, otherwise, we're back to the same issue.  nb

I agree with Teb.
The ""book-out"" is GTC Section 14.A.

Not sure what you mean by ""Balancing Entities"".
The same DPOA covers both contracts.
But, there are two contracts.
And, the two contracts are accounted for separately.
Each contract must be ""balanced"".
(Whether covered by one DPOA or two DPOAs.)
Is that what you mean?

Since FPU holds two FTS-1 contracts (according to Nancy), 
we could probably combine them (if FPU wants top do that).
Jim says that we did that for Peoples.
We would have to check and see if there was any reason not to combine.
If they were combined, then there would be balancing under one contract.

He can net imbalances together by ""booking out"" the imbalance of one entity with the imbalance of the other entity.  In other words,  do a book-out with himself.  This can be done without adding the single point as a division to an existing divisional contract.

	I spoke with Chris Snyder this morning and his request is to add New Smyrna as a 4th Division to his existing 3 Divisions in order to have one Balancing Entity  vs.. Two Balancing Entities so he can net imbalances together. He is not looking for section 11 rights and he knows the New Smyrna lateral is constrained and he can not move any additional volumes there. Chris right now will have to deal with Two Balancing Entities and this is what he is trying to avoid. He will do what ever it takes on his end that we require/request. Please take another look with the one reason (Balancing) in mind. Give me your feedback. Thanks... John.

would not have to declare bankruptcy after an audit conducted by its
newly hired accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, found no records of
company finances whatsoever.

""Our previous accounting firm told us we lost $224 million in the fiscal
third quarter, but Andersen has informed us that, at least on paper, we
didn't have a fiscal third quarter,"" said CEO Charles Conaway. ""What a
difference proper accounting makes.""

"Re: *EMCA* An arrest","Another person to keep a eye on.
White male 6 ft  165 lbs. light brown hair, not a bad looking person.
He came into my building while i was inside working and gave me the story
that he was looking for work. He had to walk through a closed gated to
get inside.
i raised a shovel and informed him that he was trespassing.
this was Sunday. i just saw him again at 1pm walking north on Taft.
In my opinion this guy is up to no good. Keep your eyes open.

"ETS and Corporate Change Control Items","The following items were discussed in this week's ETS and Corporate Change Control Items...
Sept. 24	
From 12:00 a.m. through 10/07 at 11:45 p.m., Enron Network Services is implementing a moratorium on all network changes one week prior through one week after the first move of users to Enron Center South.  This moratorium will probably be limited to routing changes, no new networks, no changes to existing networks, etc.  No impact to ETS networks is expected.

Oct. 4		
From 9:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m., the EDI team will replace the backup EDI server located in Omaha.   The existing server will be de-commissioned.  The new server will take over the dns and IP address of the old server.   No impact is expected as this server is used for disaster recovery.

Oct. 4		
From 11:00 p.m. through 10/5 at 2:00 a.m., the Unix team will rename the edinet.enron.com and ecnet.enron.com systems.  During last Saturday's EDI change, the DNS entries were changes but the actual servers were not changed to reflect their new names.  They will also install patches to the machines during the maintenance.  This change will result in a total disruption of service to EDI Web access only.  EDI will not be affected.

Oct. 5		
From 4:00 - 6:00 p.m., the Monitoring group will bring up the new ITContacts site and disable the old.  We are currently not using this site but there are plans to access it in the future.  No impact is expected.

Oct. 5		
From 7:00 - 8:00 p.m., the Corp server team will perform maintenance on the HR-DB-4 server to add more disk space.  This change will result in a disruption of service to all HR Global applications including eHRonline, GCS, GIS, expertfinder, etc.

Oct. 5		
From 9:00 - 11:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will split the two 8 port gig channels from ECS to ECN into four 4 port gig channels.  This change will fully mesh the ECS core.  No impact is expected.

Oct. 5		
From 9:00 - 11:45 p.m., the Messaging team will Test Upgrade functions of XTND 2.6.  This change affects PDA users who log into XTND.  No impact to ETS users is expected.  X-tend Connect Proxy servers will be unavailable on 10/5/01 from 9:00-11:45pm.  Palm Pilot users who use X-tend Connect Proxy to sync with Outlook will be unable to do so during this time.  

Oct. 5		
From 9:00 p.m. through 10/6 at 1:00 a.m., the Messaging team will reboot all Corp and EI Notes servers.  No impact to ETS users is expected.

Oct. 5		
From 10:00 - 10:15, Enron Network Services will migrate the following Corp servers on the 172.16.63.0 network:  foglight, charon, hyperion, perch, diablo, vision, ricky, dbadmin, worf, riker, europa, titania, pandora, ferrari, pluto, hades, opal, cyclopes, astral, and modena.  No impact to ETS is expected.

"*EMCA* Mosquitoes","Ultraviolet high voltage traps work very well.  If the problem is severe put in more than one.  Place at least 20 feet away from the area you normally use and install in an elevated location.  Leave on 24 hours a day.

Subject: 

This is a mate to another one that was sent around a couple of weeks ago, which said: Note to the Taliban: Hand over Osama Bin Laden or we will take all your women and send them to college. 
 
 

>> As for what to do with Osama bin Laden: Killing him will only create a martyr. Holding him prisoner will inspire his comrades to take hostages to demand his release.

Therefore, I suggest we do neither.

 
Let the Special Forces, Seals or whatever, covertly capture him, fly him to an undisclosed hospital and have surgeons quickly perform a complete sex change operation.  Then return her to Afghanistan to live as a woman under the Taliban.

"Amendment to Permit Use of Alternate Point outside of path","Attached is a draft agreement regarding the Citizens' contract whereby BP, as agent, has requested the use of an alternate delivery point outside the path.  The tariff permits us to agree to such alternate point and the rate.  We are not required to agree to such alternate point use under the tariff.  Therefore, we do not have to grant this right beyond that which we want, which in this case is a month.  If pressed by BP, we should respond that we are only prepared to agree to such alternate point use for a month.  For those of you unfamiliar with the Global Settlement, the reason we have the right to agree whether we want to amend a customer's  primary or alternates outside the path was to give us the opportunity to recoup the turnback costs.  In other words, by not agreeing in certain instances we may receive incremental revenues to recoup the turnback costs which we are now 100% on the hook for.  


I did not know the Contract No., Lorraine, pls. fill that in.  Given the Dynegy transition, pls. forward any additional comments to Bill Rapp.  Thanks, Maria

"FW: Transwestern Pipeline Payment Under Protest (Confirmed PAYMENT BY MAIL ONLY   -  $356,736.95)","Rod and Tracy,

As a result of a state of Colorado audit TW has been assessed tax (+penalties and interest) for compressor fuel use ($.4mm), and on the purchase of a La Plata facility ($1.3mm). We are protesting. However, it has been recommended, and I concur, that we pay
the compressor fuel use assessment (""under protest"") to stop interest accruals on the use tax assessment. We believe the sales tax assessment is at best -weak- and therefore do not recommend any payment.

We're requesting approval to cut a check to the Colorado Dept of Revenue for $356,736.95.  
This payment would be a deferred expense until the protest is fully resolved.

Also, I did not fill in the date that the FTS-1 contracts revert back to SFTS because it all depends on whether we leave the contracts open for monthly releases.  nb

"*EMCA* Free to good home","Hi Guys,

I have a beautiful, 8'+ weeping ficus that has grown way too large for my place.
These are generally house plants, but I have kept it out in the shade in the yard, and it has veritably thrived on neglect.  It put two roots out of its pot down into the ground during the summer, and these were cut when I brought the plant in during this cold snap.  I don't know if this has hurt it or not.  At any rate, it will need a larger pot.
If anyone wants it, he can have it.  But... Since I love this plant so much, I may retain rights to recall it, just in case I ever win the lottery and expand into a larger abode.

I also have a 40gallon long aquarium and stand.  I have offered this to someone already, but if he decides he doesn't want it, I will be glad to give it to anyone who wants it.

Please let me know.  I will happily deliver either item.

Good Morning!

This was shared with me and it is too neat!!  I hope you have Power Point
or another type of presentation software on your computer.  It's a little
long, but it is worth the time!  You can click anywhere on the screen in
order to speed the presentation up if you want to, but trust me, it is very
encouraging to read all the way through because it shares several of the
promises our Father gives us....one on each slide.

I hope you are blessed by being reminded of just a few of the many promises
the Word of God gives us because the only way we can deal with situations
like the one our country is facing right now and have peace and not be in
fear is through the living truth of Word of God.

Have a wonderful day!!!!

Peace and Love,

Constance

My office followed up on the various emails about this location.  We had a
series of responses.  Below are the definitive ones.

Our investigator found major unpermitted remodeling and changes in
occupancy. Issued a stop work order today subject to citations. There will
be follow up and plans will be required.

Sheila,

We could not find any permits for the work at the above address.  Could you
check your system and see if they have any permits.  They may need parking
but, I can't address the parking until I see the plans.

"Re: *EMCA* Free to good home","So glad you could come to the party--it would never seem the same
without you.

Debbie called the next day and left a message saying she had planned to
come but had thought it was New Year's Eve.  She never mentioned that I
had called her twice (at least) to ask when I could drop by a small
gift.  I was hoping she would come but not too surprised.  Please stay
in touch with her.

The Mexican star lantern is really wonderful--you were absolutely
right--definitely my kind of thing!  It's been lighted every day since
Don brought it home.  I love telling folks it's my night light, although
I really don't leave it on all night.  Maybe one day I'll decide where
to hang it up.  For now, it's in a fine place.  I really can't thank you
enough for spying it and buying it for me.  It's sort of like the
whirl-a-gig--something you don't know you can't live without until you
see it!

Thanks for the leads on computer help.  I definitely need someone who
makes house calls--to my office.  do these folks do that?

Fort Union Gas Gathering announced that as of Sept. 5 it had tested and placed in service a 62-mile expansion of its system which will allow it to accommodate increased natural gas production in the Powder River Basin. Gathering system capacity is now at 634 MMcf/d, up from 434 MMcf/d before the expansion. 
The system now extends roughly 105 miles from near Gillette, Wyoming, south to Glenrock, Wyoming. The system interconnects with Colorado Interstate Gas' Powder River lateral, the KN Interstate system, and Wyoming Interstate's Medicine Bow Lateral. 
Fort Union Gas is a limited liability company whose partners are affiliates of CMS Energy, Northern Border Partners, Western Gas Resources, El Paso and Williams.


EOTT'S RECAPITALIZATION WILL INCLUDE CONVERSION OF UNITS, NEW FINANCING

09/24/2001 
Petroleum Finance Week 
(c) 2001 Phillips Business Information, Inc. 
EOTT Energy Partners L. P. (NYSE: EOT) announced a recapitalization that will include a conversion of outstanding subordinated units and additional partnership interests (APIs) into common units and implementation of a refinancing plan. Upon the plan's successful completion, directors of EOTT's general partner, EOTT Energy Corp., intend to increase the annual cash distribution on common units from $1.90 to $1.95. Elements of the plan require unitholder approval, which will be sought later this year. ""We believe that the plan enhances the value of EOTT's common units and places our common unitholders in a position to realize immediate benefit from increases in the partnership's available cash,"" said EOTT Chairman Stan Horton. 
In the conversion of subordinated units and APIs to common units, Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) and Koch Petroleum Group L.P. have agreed to convert all 9 million outstanding subordinated units and $9.3 million of APIs into approximately 4.3 million common units. EOTT anticipates that these changes in capital structure will enhance its ability to increase cash distributions to its common unitholders. An amendment to the partnership agreement will be required to make the conversion. 
EOTT also intends to affect equity and long-term debt offerings to refinance short-term debt incurred in connection with a $117 million asset acquisition that it completed in June 2001. The Houston partnership also intends to replace its existing working capital credit facility with a new bank credit line. EOTT said that the financings, which it expects to complete by the end of the year, would not require it to amend the partnership agreement.

published : September 25, 2001
APGA Urges EIA to Gather Gas Data to Dampen Price Volatility 
The American Public Gas Association (APGA) has called on the Energy Information Administration (EIA) to begin collecting and distributing ""relevant and timely"" natural gas production and consumption information on a regular basis to help temper the ""extreme price swings"" in the market. 
""We believe that such information, if available on a timely basis, would achieve the twin goals of providing better transparency in the marketplace and effectively promoting stability in natural gas markets,"" wrote APGA President Bob Cave in a letter Friday to EIA Acting Administrator Mary Jean Hutzler. 
Specifically, the group of municipal distributors urged the Department of Energy (DOE) agency to ""exercise its broad jurisdiction"" under the Federal Energy Administration Act (FEAA) to ""collect and disseminate"" information pertaining to production, production capability, pipeline capacity, pipeline capacity utilization and end-use consumption by customer class. This ""is not intended as an inclusive list of needed information, but rather as a starting point."" 
By gathering this additional information, Cave believes the overriding significance that the gas industry currently attaches to the American Gas Association's (AGA) weekly storage reports would diminish. ""AGA's weekly storage report is an important piece of data because industry participants perceive it as an indicator of the balance in supply and demand. But, because it is just about the only relevant and timely data available in the marketplace, there is an inordinate amount of price volatility associated with its anticipated release and its actual release,"" he said. 
APGA ""firmly believes that the only way to combat such volatility is to make available to the marketplace other relevant production and consumption data, so that the AGA report is viewed in its proper perspective,"" Cave noted. 
The group recommended that the EIA meet with other industry trade groups and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ""as promptly as possible to develop a comprehensive list of the needed data to permit EIA to fulfill its statutory mission"" under the FEAA. 

     



COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Appetite for North American energy assets remains strong - The pace ...
By SHEILA MCNULTY and KEN WARN.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Appetite for North American energy assets remains strong - The pace of mergers and acquisitions in the oil and gas industry shows no sign of slowing, write Ken Warn and Sheila McNulty. 
Global economic uncertainty and weak oil and gas prices are not slowing the pace of consolidation in the North American energy industry. 
With some oil and gas companies bullish on energy prices over the longer term, Canadian assets, in particular, look set to remain in strong demand. 
The appetite for energy assets could even strengthen as companies look for secure and readily accessible oil and gas supplies following the attacks on the US, some analysts believe. 
""We are starting to see a lot more interest in domestic players,"" says Martin Molyneaux of Calgary-based First Energy Capital. ""Assets in political hot spots have been sharply marked down."" 
Duke Energy, the biggest US utility owner, last week agreed to buy Westcoast Energy, a Canadian pipeline company, for about USDollars 8.5bn in cash, stock and assumed debt. 
TransCanada Pipelines, the country's biggest pipeline company, on Friday sold some of its gas marketing and trading operations to a unit of BP. 
At least two other Canadian energy companies may be on the block. 
Husky Energy, the integrated oil and gas producer, confirmed last week it was in talks with unnamed ""parties"" on ""potential transactions"". 
Calgary-based Husky, which is majority-owned by companies controlled by Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong businessman, has a market capitalisation of C$7.9bn (USDollars 5.04bn). 
The company has heavy oil assets in western Canada, refining and marketing operations, and expertise in natural gas. Husky's assets could be divided among several purchasers, analysts believe, with US, Canadian or international companies among the possible buyers. 
Canadian Hunter, a smaller producer which is focused on natural gas, has seen its share price rise 15 per cent over the past four weeks amid takeover speculation. 
""Any American company that wants to set up a presence in Canadian natural gas could find Canadian Hunter attractive,"" Mr Molyneaux says. 
PanCanadian Petroleum, one of Canada's biggest natural gas producers, is one of a handful of Canadian companies seen as having the scale to be a consolidator in the industry, but even it could fall prey to a US or international buyer. It is due to be spun off next month by majority-owner Canadian Pacific. 
US energy companies say they have been increasingly looking to Canada because it is relatively unexplored compared with the US. 
""Reserves have generally declined in the US over the past 10 years,"" says Rob McKee, executive vice-president of exploration and production at Conoco. 
""The lower 48 states are much more drilled and explored than Canada is."" Conoco itself acquired Gulf Canada Resources in July in a USDollars 6.3bn deal - the largest oil and gas deal in Canadian history. 
Analysts suspect the terrorist attacks on the US could bolster the arguments for opening the environmentally sensitive Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to drilling. 
That would lessen US dependence on foreign energy sources. ""Perhaps this will provide the push to open up the Arctic refuge,"" says Bill Featherston of UBS Warburg. 
Investors' wariness of energy companies with assets in politically sensitive areas has taken its toll on Canada's Talisman Energy, which has seen its share price under pressure since the attacks on the US. 
Talisman has a 25 per cent stake in the Greater Nile Oil Project in Sudan, a country wracked by civil war and which was formerly a haven for Osama bin Laden.

CALIFORNIA PREMIUM GASOLINE DROPS TO 91 OCTANE RATING

09/24/2001 
Octane Week 
(c) 2001 Phillips Business Information, Inc. 
With little fanfare, the octane rating of premium gasoline in California has dropped from 92 to 91. The change occurred in the first week of August. While the California Energy Commission (CEC) says the switch was made to help refiners deal with the upcoming MTBE ban in the state beginning in 2003 and the subsequent demand for ethanol, some say other factors are at work - such as Unocal's RFG patents. 
""To say it's just the ethanol issue... no way,"" said Will Woods, executive director of the Automotive Trade Organizations of California. ""We don't believe that for one minute."" 
The CEC lowered the octane rating of premium gasoline in California after asking Kinder Morgan, the state's primary fuel pipeline operator, to survey oil refiners about whether or not they wanted to make the change, said CEC spokesperson Rob Schlichting. When refiners said yes, the CEC made the switch, he said. ""As California moves ahead without MTBE, it is difficult to create 92 octane gasoline,"" he continued. ""They would have to use a lot of other blending components."" 
It's cheaper to use Unocal's patents to make 92 octane gasoline than it is to blend around them, Woods said. But it's even cheaper to switch to 91 octane and never have to worry about the Unocal patents again, he continued. 
Schlichting admits that he has heard that avoiding the Unocal patents is a big benefit of the new octane rating, but said that was not the reason the CEC did its initial study. The decision was not made with any government involvement, and was a result of industry input, he said. 
While the octane rating has dropped, the price of premium gasoline has not dropped accordingly, Schlichting also acknowledged. ""I don't think it's enough of a quality change that you'll see a drop in price,"" he said. ""After all, it's not inferior gasoline."" 
""It sounds like a profit maximizing strategy to me,"" Unocal spokesman Barry Lane said. ""We find it very interesting that they drop octane, but margins remain the same. The consumer will ultimately decide if this is a good idea or not.""


Williams Invests Big in Deepwater.

Natural Gas Week

Williams will invest more than $400 million to develop the infrastructure for the Devils Tower deepwater project, the company announced last week. 
Devils Tower is being developed through an innovative, but increasingly popular, third-party midstream transaction by Williams. The field will be majority owned and operated by Dominion Exploration & Production, while Williams will build the infrastructure for Dominion to use (17#37-07). 
In exchange for the use of the facilities required to produce the Devils Tower field, Dominion and Pioneer Natural Resources, the minority field owner, will make fixed monthly payments. Williams will own the floating production facility and export pipelines. Williams has contracted with Dominion to operate the floating production facilities. 
A portion of the expected revenues for the project through 2011 will come from these fixed payments associated with the use of the infrastructure. The fixed payments will begin upon facility commissioning and will provide more than 50% of the anticipated revenue for the first five years of the project, Williams said. 
Williams will assume responsibility for payment of the truss spar floating production facility which Dominion had already contracted from J. Ray McDermott's SparTEC subsidiary. The facility will handle up to 60,000 b/d of oil from as many as eight wells. First production is expected in mid-2003. Reserves are estimated at 50 million-75 million bbl of oil. 
The field is located in Mississippi Canyon Block 773 in 5,600 feet of water. Dominion is the operator and 75% interest holder. Pioneer has the remaining stake. 
In addition, Williams plans to build two separate oil and gas pipelines from the floating production facility. The 18-inch Canyon Chief gas pipeline will run 96 miles to the Mobile Bay lateral owned by Transco, a unit of Williams. The Transco lateral will move the product to Williams' Mobile Bay gas processing plant. The natural gas liquids will then be shipped to Williams' Baton Rouge fractionator and other downstream markets on the Tri-States and Wilprise pipelines, which are operated and partly owned by Williams. 
The oil line, the Mountaineer pipeline, will transport crude oil from the deepwater platform to an onshore oil terminal.

As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.

"Re: Transwestern Record Storage at Iron Mountain (Omaha)","Teb, As we discussed, the Omaha Iron Mountain storage facility contains some 198 boxes of Transwestern documents. These documents came from Transwestern/Houston originally and related to old certificate and rate filings. Because of the pending acquisition of Northern by Dynegy, Northern needs to isolate our storage records. Consequently, were asking you to retrieve and take ownership of the 198 boxes from the Omaha IM facility. This will involve having Houston Iron Mountain initiating the request for shipping from the Omaha facility and being responsible for the disposition of the boxes when they are received. The estimated shipping costs to Transwestern for the boxes would be approx. $2,200 - $2,400 . The box numbers for the Transwestern records were previously provided to you by letter dated 8/10/01. In addition, would you please provide me your cost center #, company #, GL account # and material # so that the box retrieval fee ($1/box) charged to Northern's account by the Omaha Iron Mountain facility can be cross-charged to Transwestern ? 

If you have any questions or if I can assist in facilitating this request, please give me a call. 
Thanks,

"Enron and United Way's Continued Partnership","
Last month all of your donations helped Enron raise a grand total of $6 million for the United Way, including our corporate match.  Once again Enron employees made a difference and contributed more than any other pacesetter company in Houston. Also, congratulations to Elaine Brown with Enron Global Markets who won the drawing for two round-trip airline tickets for participating in this year's campaign.  Thanks to everyone at Enron for your generosity!

This week Enron and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership. Beginning with the Astros vs Giants game on Tuesday, October 2, one of Enron's primary signs at Enron Field will feature the United Way logo alongside the Enron logo.

The decision to include United Way's logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in-stadium signage locations with a non-profit partner.  This sign is also a free, innovative way to demonstrate Enron's support of the United Way and promote the agency's role in our community.

The millions of fans who attend Astros games each season will see the sign.  Be sure to look for this history-making sign hanging high above the outfield.

"*EMCA* Re: Ecclesia and 2115 Taft","Hi guys, Jenny Johnson here. My husband and I are running a small bookstore
in space lent to us by Ecclesia Church. I wanted to let you know that they
do have a building permit for the construction going on there; you can see
it in the window of the door that's on the center right as you face the
building. Though they aren't breaking parking codes with their events, they
do realize that they are inconveniencing the neighborhood and will be paving
a lot in the back of their building to alleviate pressure on nearby streets.
They want to be good neighbors and would welcome hearing concerns that
anyone has. 

Also, here's a little plug, while we're at it: The bookstore is called
Strange Land Books. We specialize in classic and contemporary fiction,
culture studies, and Christian theology. We're non-profit, and proceeds
benefit Houston literacy projects. Our opening party is this Fri., Jan. 25,
from 6-9 pm. We'll take twenty percent off all books all night, and have
light refreshments courtesy of the coffeeshop/vegetarian cafe that will also
soon open in the same space.

Please come see us, and if you have any more questions about what's going on
at 2115 Taft, email me with them. If I can't answer, I'll refer you to
someone who can.

Peace,
Jenny

"Steve Cooper voicemail - 2/14/2002","Earlier today, Steve Cooper left the following voicemail for employees. Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcript of that message.

------------------------------------------------------
Voicemail Transcript - Steve Cooper
February 14, 2002

Hi everybody, this is Steve Cooper.  It is February 14, so Happy Valentine's Day to everybody. I just wanted to bring everybody up to speed on a number of items - I want to make sure that I keep you all in the loop so everyone has a pretty good sense of what's going on.

First of all, I want to thank a number of you for some very nice voice mails or emails.  They've been very supportive and I thank you for that.  I do intend to get back to everybody personally -- I've just been busy and jammed up this week, but I do want you to know I really appreciate it.  It's been a little hectic this week, so I do apologize for the delay in getting back to you.

Anyway, a couple of things have happened this week and I just want to make sure everybody understands what they are.  Number one is the result of the special investigative report.  We're beginning to reshape the senior management team and as a result Rick Buy and Rick Causey's employment with the company has been terminated.  To the extent that there are any additional changes, obviously I'll keep you up to speed.

We're also in the process of shrinking and reconstituting the Board.  Six directors resigned earlier this week and their resignation is effective in 30 days.  We're initiating a fairly aggressive search for some new directors, which will continue to replace some existing directors and at the end of the day the board will be reconstituted.

At the Board meeting this week, I reiterated that it's my intent in working with all of you to present some restructuring proposals to the creditor's committee by the second quarter, and nothing that I see today leads me conclude that we can't make that schedule.  I continue to believe that there is a very nice re-organizable platform here, so that the company can move forward.

There was some bad news with respect to Enron stock.  As far as I can tell, the claims base here - that is bank debt, bond holder debt and other unsecured creditors debt - is going to overwhelm the reorganized value of whatever platform that we move forward.  As a result, it's not probable that there will any residual value for existing shareholders.  That's not good news.  It's an unfortunate result of this problem, and I wish it was different.  But I don't want you to be misled and I don't want any of you to believe that there is value there, because I don't think there will be.  In particular I don't want you to continue to invest your earnings in Enron stock without being aware of, at least in my view, shareholder value at the end of the day.

The media sometimes interprets the elimination of existing shareholder value as a sign that this is going to be a liquidation.  I don't believe that will be the case here.  I think we have a tough road to hoe.  I think that it is going to require us to rebuild credibility in this company and its management team.  None the less, I do believe that we are going to have a reorganization here, and I'm absolutely committed and dedicated to making that happen.

A couple of other things that I want you to be aware of:  as soon as the dust settles around the reformation of the management team, we will get out a memo as to who the new management team will be and what their roles, responsibilities are.

We are continuing to shape and push forward with the creditors committee a retention and severance program, which I know is important to all of you.  As that gets cemented, I will provide you with additional updates.  

And another thing, I've asked a number of our colleagues to plan in early to mid-March, an employee meeting at one of these local hotels.  It will, more likely than not, be in the evening and it can go as late as you want it to go.  What I thought we would do is give everybody, in a plain vanilla way, a short presentation as to where we are going and how we intend to get there.  Then we will have a giant question and answer session, so that if any of you have concerns, issues, problems, or upsets, we can get it all out on the table and figure out collectively the best way to deal with these things.

That's where we stand as of Valentine's Day.  Once again, I would like to thank all of those of you who have given me some real nice emails and voicemails for your support. Again, I apologize that I haven't been able to get back to you as quickly as I would like, but I promise you I will and I hope everybody has a great day.

If you have any questions or issues, send me an email, give me a buzz or drop by my office.  I would be more than happy to have a chat with you.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Thanks again so much and I'll give you the next update as soon as practicably possible.

"RE: Transwestern Pipeline Payment Under Protest (Confirmed PAYMENT BY MAIL ONLY   -  $356,736.95)","OK

Subject:	FW: Transwestern Pipeline Payment Under Protest (Confirmed PAYMENT BY MAIL ONLY   -  $356,736.95)

Rod and Tracy,

As a result of a state of Colorado audit TW has been assessed tax (+penalties and interest) for compressor fuel use ($.4mm), and on the purchase of a La Plata facility ($1.3mm). We are protesting. However, it has been recommended, and I concur, that we pay
the compressor fuel use assessment (""under protest"") to stop interest accruals on the use tax assessment. We believe the sales tax assessment is at best -weak- and therefore do not recommend any payment.

We're requesting approval to cut a check to the Colorado Dept of Revenue for $356,736.95.  
This payment would be a deferred expense until the protest is fully resolved.

Another tidbit to remind us that we see/hear Divinity all around us: 

Just remember, ""Our God is an Awesome God!"" 

READ This All the Way, and send it back please! 
This will give you the chills.....GOOD Chills! 

A young man had been to Wed. night Bible Study. The pastor had shared 
about listening to God and obeying the Lord's voice. The young man 
couldn't help but wonder, Does God still speak to people?"" 

After service, he went out with some friends for coffee 
and pie, and they discussed the message. Several different ones talked 
about how God had led them in different ways. 

It was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home. 
Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, ""God...If you still speak to 
people speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey."" 

As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest 
thought to stop and buy a gallon of milk. He shook his head and said out 
loud, ""God is that you?""  He didn't get a reply and started on toward 
home. 

But again, the thought, buy a gallon of milk. The young man thought 
about Samuel and how he didn't recognize the voice of God, and how 
little Samuel ran to Eli. ""Okay, God, in case that is you, I will buy 
the milk."" It didn't seem like too hard a test of obedience. He could 
always use the milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of milk and 
started off toward home. 

As he passed Seventh Street, he again felt the urge, ""Turn down that 
street."" This is crazy he thought and drove on past the intersection. 
Again, he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street. At the next 
intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he 
said out loud, ""Okay, God, I will."" 

He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop. 
He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in a 
semi-commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst 
of neighborhoods either. The businesses were closed and most of the 
houses looked dark like the people were already in bed. 

Again, he sensed something, ""Go and give the milk to the people in the 
house across the street."" The young man looked at the house. It was dark 
and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already 
asleep. He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat. 
""Lord, this is insane. Those people are asleep and, if I wake them up, 
they are going to be mad and I will look stupid."" 

Again, he felt like he should go and give the milk. Finally, he opened 
the door.   ""Okay God, if this is you, I will go to the door and I will 
give them the milk. If you want me to look like a crazy person, okay. I 
want to be obedient. I guess that will count for something, but, if they 
don't answer right away, I am out of here. 

He walked across the street and rang the bell. He could hear some noise 
inside. A man's voice yelled out, ""Who is it? What do you want?""   Then 
the door opened before the young man could get away.    The man was 
standing there in his jeans and t-shirt.  He looked like he just got out 
of bed. He had a strange look on his face, and he didn't seem too happy 
to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. ""What is it?"" The young 
man thrust out the gallon of milk. ""Here I brought this to you."" 

The man took the milk and rushed down a hallway, speaking loudly in 
Spanish. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the milk toward 
the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was 
crying. The man had tears streaming down his face. The man began 
speaking and half-crying, ""We were just praying. We had some big bills 
this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any milk for our 
baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some 
milk."" 

His wife in the kitchen yelled out, ""I ask him to send an Angel with 
some. Are you an Angel?"" 

The young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he 
had on him and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward 
his car and the tears were streaming down his face.   He knew that God 
still answers prayers. 

This is a simple test... 

If you believe that God is alive and well, send this to at least ten 
people and the person that sent it to you!

"*EMCA* Neighborhood break-ins","In response to the message about the burgluries, I would like to say 
that there has been a tremendous increase in this activity over the 
past couple years.  Lorraine and I experienced our first such event 
last winter when a heavily tatooed man broke into our home in broad 
daylight to steal our bicicles, precious jewelry and other items. We 
have 2 dogs that bark at everything but they did not deter this man 
as he paid no mind to them.

A few weeks ago there were 3 or 4 car break-ins on Taft Street but I 
don't think any of these were reported to the police.

We had mentioned this at previous meetings but would just like to 
remind everyone to keep their eyes open and call the police if you 
see anything suspicous at all.  As more and more new people move into 
town, the chance of being burglured will increase.  The policewoman 
that responded to our call said that our area is a target for theft.  
I don't think there is any reason to panic or consider moving to the 
burbs, it is just a fact of life that these crimes will occur.  We 
all need to act as one and watch out for each other.

When I first moved here back in 1994 I remember talking to a guy whom 
I think was the president of EMCA at the time (can't remember his 
name, but he lived accross the street from me) Him and his wife moved 
to Russia or something.  Anyway, there was a neighborhood watch 
program in affect where people took turns driving and walking the 
neighborhood.  Is there anything like this going on now?  Just 
wondering.

Transwestern is getting ready to begin testing their new contract system.  In preparation for implementation of the new system, we need to make changes to TW's tariff to allow the option of Electronic Contracting the same way we did to FGT's tariff when we implemented their new system.  

The new contract system is scheduled to go into production Q1, 2002.

Subject: FW: Attachment A - Payment Schedule



All,

We are still working on all the details of the proposed interconnect with Questar Southern Trails in the Blanco Hub and will send you a copy soon for your review.  Since the interconnect is fully reimbursable, Questar is proposing to pay us according to the attached payment schedule vs. paying all of it up front.  

Please take a look at this attached schedule and provide me you comments.  If we allow them to pay ""along the way"" I am interested in making sure it at least matches the timing of our cash outlay of building the interconnect.  The total estimate of $702,000 includes the tax gross up, which may or may not be applicable, so each of these amount may be reduced by the tax amount.


Does anyone have any concerns with the timing of the payment schedule?  

Thanks, Kim.

US Physical Gas Prices Lower For First-Of-Month Oct

09/28/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices Friday fell considerably for the first day of October, as traders saw wide ranges and light demand. 
""Everything cratered,"" said a Texas trader. 
Anticipated first-of-month indexes for October are around 50 cents to 90 cents below September's indexes at the pipelines, depending on location, according to traders. 
Marketers Friday traded for the first day of October and saw spreads widen considerably between cash and futures bidding. 
Looking ahead, traders expect to see some incremental demand next month, as some utilities switch to natural gas from fuel oil and a number of nuclear energy sites go off-line for maintenance, one veteran trader said. 
October, a shoulder month, tends to be a major price discount month, a trader said. Presently on the Nymex, there is a 50-plus-cent difference between October cash and November futures. The 12-month strip widened to 86 cents. 
The Nymex November natural gas futures contract settled Friday at $2.244 a million British thermal units, down 0.9 of a cent. October expired Wednesday at $1.83/MMBtu, in the vicinity of 30-month lows. 
At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, the delivery point for Nymex gas, prices fell 11 cents on the bid, but rose 1 cent on the offer to a $1.72-$1.92/MMBtu closing range. 
First-of-month October index prices for the Henry Hub are predicted to be around $1.85-$1.86/MMBtu, traders said. September index for the Henry Hub is around $2.34/MMBtu. 
Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done at $1.80-$1.92/MMBtu, down 24 cents. 
At the Arizona-California Border, where gas from El Paso's pipeline begins delivery to Southern California, buyers paid $1.82-$1.90/MMBtu, up 6 cents to 7 cents. Anticipated index for October is seen at $1.78-$1.80/MMBtu. Index for September is at $2.66/MMBtu. 
At PG&E Citygate, traders paid $1.83-$1.95/MMBtu, up 10 cents to 12 cents. October index is expected around $1.83/MMBtu. September first-of-month index is at $2.71/MMBtu. 
At the Katy hub in East Texas, prices were in a $1.73-$1.83/MMBtu range, down 5 cents to 9 cents. Anticipated first-of-month October index is $1.82-$1.84/MMBtu, compared with September index of $2.37/MMBtu. 
At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $1.60-$1.68/MMBtu, down 5 cents. October first-of-month index is anticipated around $1.71/MMBtu, compared with $2.32/MMBtu for September, traders said.

Risk On Rival Pipeline May Help Canada Natural Gas Line
By Dina O'Meara

09/28/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
CALGARY -(Dow Jones)- Development of Canadian Arctic natural gas gained points this week after producers in Alaska announced their competing pipeline projects could be too risky to pursue. 
But analysts - and producers - caution that the temporary retreat by ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM), BP PLC (BP T.BP U.BP) and Phillips Petroleum (P T.PLP) from the ""very high-risk"" project doesn't change fundamental issues challenging the Canadian side of the Arctic fence. 
""If an Alaskan pipeline doesn't go, there would be potential benefits for a Canadian line simply because huge volumes of Alaska gas - four billion cubic feet a day - won't hit the market,"" Calgary analyst Ed Small acknowledged Friday. But he added: ""I just don't know if that's enough to make the Mackenzie Delta pipeline happen."" 
Industry estimates natural gas has to sell for at least US$3 a million British thermal units to make a northern pipeline economically feasible. And natural gas prices that tanked from US$10/MMBtu in December to US$2.24/MMBtu this week haven't given encouraging signals to an increasingly tentative market. 
However, the fact that a growing demand for natural gas isn't projected to abate and immense untapped resources await in the north serve as favorable factors. 
""The advantage the Mackenzie Delta pipeline has is it's smaller in incremental volumes (than Alaska) and in capital costs,"" said Paul Mortensen, from the Calgary-based Canadian Energy Research Institute. 
The overland route from the Delta, at the western tip of the Northwest Territories, through Alberta and into the U.S. is being considered by several producer groups, the largest one formed by Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO T.IMO), Shell Canada Ltd. (T.HSC), ExxonMobil Canada (X.XOC) and Conoco Canada Resources Ltd. (COCA COCB), formerly Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. 
A Mackenzie Valley pipeline would ship between 700 million cubic feet of gas a day to 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas a day to the U.S. for several million dollars less than either proposed Alaska routes, analysts say. 
 
Capital Costs Massive 
   
The Imperial consortium hasn't released any cost estimates, however, the Alaska group's preliminary figures pin huge capital costs on both their proposed Arctic lines: US$15.1 billion to run Alaska gas through Prudhoe Bay down the Northwest Territories or US$17.2 billion along the Alaska Highway through the Yukon. 
""Right here, now, today, neither route is economic,"" said ExxonMobil's Robert Shilhab, adding that the project hasn't been shelved. 
Tolls to ship the Arctic gas down to the continental U.S. were estimated at an eyebrow-raising US$2.03-US$2.39/MMBtu - about 10 U.S. cents higher than month-ahead contracts selling Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
Imperial Oil spokesman Hart Searle said the Mackenzie consortium wasn't so dependent on current pricing as it is on projections for when the pipeline would start flowing volumes - around 2008. They are still optimistic prices will rebound, but realize the massive project carries a certain amount of risk. 
""Typically, investments that open new regions and new basins are not as economically robust as those that come after it,"" Searle said. 
The consortium still hopes to file a preliminary application for the pipeline by the end of this year, he said. Completing regulatory reviews are expected to take up to four years, with another two to four years required on the physical construction.

Extremists target European gas pipelines ; Algerian threat
ELIZABETH NASH in Madrid

The Independent - London

Page 2 
(Copyright 2001 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited) 
Algerian Islamists linked to Osama bin Laden have threatened to declare war on British and other ""vital Western interests"" by blowing up oil and gas pipelines that run from North Africa to Europe. 
The threat follows the arrest last week in Spain of six members of Algeria's extremist Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (SGPC), after an MI6 tip-off, for their role in a plot to blow up the US embassy in Paris. 
The message sent to the Algerian media named France, Germany, Britain and Belgium as the ""European countries that persecute Islamists and cooperate with the US in their struggle against Bin Laden"". 
It was issued by Hassen Hatab, who attended a recent meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with associates of Mr bin Laden. The CIA filmed one of the hijackers who was on the plane that hit the Pentagon at the same meeting. 
The Salafistas, a dissident breakaway from the Armed Islamic Group - backed by Mr Bin Laden's Al-Qa'edah organisation - appear on a US blacklist of groups suspected of taking part in the 11 September attack. 
A suicide strike at any point of the vast transcontinental pipeline would choke off a lifeline that fuels the economies of Spain, Portugal, Italy and France. Spain has sharply increased its dependence on Algerian natural gas in recent years. 
Britain would also feel the impact of such a terrorist attack. Although the UK is still an exporter of gas from the North Sea, it is expected to become a net importer within the next few years. 
The organisation said it intended to attack the pipelines carrying liquid gas from Algeria to Spain via Morocco and to Italy via Tunisia, alongside Algeria's giant refineries on the Mediterranean ports of Arzew and Skikda. 
The six Algerians arrested this week in Madrid were accused of planning to launch suicide attacks on US targets in Europe. 
Spain is increasingly worried that the Algerian pipeline, which enters Spain at Tarifa, near Gibraltar, may become one of the next big terrorist targets. Originating in Algeria's central Hassid Messaud region, it has suddenly become a strategic flashpoint. 
In the 10 years since Algeria's armed Islamic opposition has been active, they have barely targeted oil and gas installations, tacitly sharing the government's view that crucial emblems of national prosperity were untouchable. But observers believe this truce will not hold if Washington launches an assault on Afghanistan. 
Spain says that in the event of an attack, it would import liquefied natural gas in special tankers from Russia. And Brussels has been pondering for months how to guarantee the EU's expanding energy needs if oil imports are disrupted. 
Sources in Spain's oil sector reckon Algeria's armed forces and intelligence services are on sufficiently high alert to keep the oil and gas flow secure, as it provides the bulk of the country's foreign currency earnings. 



Depressed natural gas prices could hamper all Arctic gas development
BY JAMES STEVENSON

09/28/2001 
The Canadian Press 
Copyright (c) 2001 The Canadian Press. All rights reserved. 
CALGARY (CP) _ The same low natural gas prices that suggest it's not economical to build a U.S.-based pipeline accessing Alaska's large gas reserves could cause problems for a Canadian line tapping gas in the Northwest Territories. 
``There's no doubt that northern gas is expensive,'' Duncan Robertson, managing partner of energy analysts SBM Inc., said Friday. ``So the economics have to be pretty rigorous to pursue any significant amount of activity _ whether that's drilling, or facilities construction or transportation.'' 
Robertson said he believes at least one northern gas pipeline will eventually be built to access the large reserves on Alaska's North Slope and the N.W.T.'s Mackenzie Delta, but exactly when remains unclear because of slumping gas prices. 
``I don't believe this will eliminate northern gas pipelines, but I do believe that the current commodity price trends _ which are downward _ have the potential to delay progress start-up on these pipelines.'' 
On Thursday, several global oil giants looking at building a pipeline out of Alaska said a preliminary analysis showed the project would be too pricey. 
``At this point, neither of the two routes we're considering are economic, but we're working hard to reduce costs,'' said Dave MacDowell, spokesman for the Alaska Gas Producers Pipeline Team which represents industry heavyweights Exxon/Mobil, BP and Phillips Petroleum. 
MacDowell denied reports that the producers were shelving all pipeline plans. 
``Bottom line is we're peddling as fast as we can.'' 
Although the decision to build a pipeline eventually rests with the energy producers, the whole debate has been steeped in fierce politics _ including Canadian and U.S. leaders, territorial heads and First Nations groups. 
That's because a pipeline connecting Arctic natural gas to American markets would be a massive project worth billions of dollars to the jurisdictions it passes through. 
The preliminary study shows an Alaskan pipeline route would cost at least $15-billion US. 
Talk of building gas pipelines from both Alaska and the N.W.T. heated up substantially at the start of the year when gas prices were hitting record highs of more than $10 US per thousand cubic feet. 
But a slumping economy _ left reeling after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United States _ and unprecedented natural gas supply has sent prices plummeting to one-fifth of their January highs. Prices continued to hover below $2 per thousand cubic feet this week. 
And predictions of another warm winter, combined with warnings of an impending recession, do not bode well for future prices. 
In their preliminary analysis, the Alaskan producers say a pipeline would yield a return on investment of 10 to 11 per cent, instead of the desired 15 per cent. 
A separate group of energy producers is also studying the feasibility of accessing gas reserves in the Mackenzie Delta. 
Hart Searle of Imperial Oil said this group still hopes to have a decision before the end of the year on whether it will proceed with plans to seek regulatory approval on a pipeline. 
``The producer group watches what goes on in the commodity markets and yes, we've seen a pretty steep decline in natural gas prices,'' says Searle. 
``But as we look at the economics for potential development like a Mackenzie Valley pipeline, the economics aren't dependent on today's prices but what prices will be in the longer term, i.e. in the next 10, 20 to 30 years.'' 
And while the group has not officially released a cost estimate of a pipeline direct south from N.W.T. to the existing network in Alberta, Searle says Imperial ``hasn't taken exception'' to estimates of between $3 billion and $4 billion, which would be vastly cheaper than the Alaskan pipeline route. 
``That puts a different face on your economics,'' he said. 
Other analysts say warnings from the Alaskan producers that they might not go ahead with their pipeline was a political cry-for-help to the U.S. government, which has been keen to increase domestic energy supplies. 
TransCanada Pipelines, one of Canada's biggest shippers of natural gas with possible involvement in both the Alaskan and Mackenzie Delta lines, is also remaining positive that development will proceed. 
``TransCanada still believes that two northern pipeline systems, independent from each other and serving the needs of each individual basin will increase the flexibility for natural gas producers and provide the highest overall value for stakeholders,'' said spokesman Glenn Herchak. 



INDIA: Panel suggests Indian govt pay in Enron row-paper.

10/01/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
BOMBAY, Oct 1 (Reuters) - An Indian panel has suggested the federal government be willing to spend almost 57 billion rupees ($1.19 billion) to help resurrect the Enron Corp Dabhol power project, which stopped producing electricity more than three months ago, a business daily said on Monday. 
The panel was constituted in early 2001 to review all aspects of the controversial power project, set up at a cost of $2.9 billion on the west coast of India. 
The Business Standard daily said the panel's report had suggested Dabhol's various stakeholders all be willing to absorb the costs that would have to be incurred to revive the 2,184 MW gas-based project. 
Dabhol Power Company is 65 percent owned by Enron Corp . GE and Bechtel own 10 percent each, while the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, a local state-owned power utility, owns the remaining 15 percent. 
The western state of Maharashtra is a guarantor to the Dabhol project and the federal government is its counter-guarantor. 
U.S.-based Enron has said it wants to exit the project after a bitter dispute with the local utility, which had initially contracted to purchase all the power from Dabhol Power Company's plant. 
It subsequently defaulted on payments, saying it didn't need that much power, which it claimed was too expensive in any case. Enron claimed the utility was reneging on its contractual obligations. 
Dabhol finally took the utility to the International Court of Arbitration in London, warning India faces liabilities worth $5 billion. 
But Enron has simultaneously said it is willing to settle out of court if it can recover its costs. 
While there have been many suggestions, the panel's report is among the few to provide a detailed solution, including the liability each party would have to shoulder. 
A SOLUTION 
The panel was set up by the Maharashtra government. Its main brief was to suggest ways of reworking the power purchase agreement so as to reduce Dabhol's tariff. After the dispute worsened, the panel was also asked to suggest revival measures. 
The panel proposed that if all the stakeholders were willing to absorb the specified losses, the tariff on Dabhol's power could be reduced to between 2.25 and 2.4 rupees per kilowatt-hour from 3.65 to 3.91 rupees at 90 percent capacity utilisation, the newspaper reported. 
According to the panel's report, the federal government's liability of 56.63 billion rupees included an infusion of 25 billion in cash, waiving customs duties on the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and cutting import duties on capital goods, the report said. 
It said the panel has also suggested Enron, GE and Bechtel together absorb a loss of 28.35 billion rupees on their investment in the project. ($1=47.93 rupees). 



USA: FEATURE-Women rise to power in deregulated energy industry.
By Carolyn Koo

09/30/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The phrase ""women in power"" has new meaning now, given the changes in the utility industry. 
The standard-issue utility executive has invariably been male: He had an engineering background, all the better to deal with the capital-intensive business of power plants, and he craved stability in an industry that eschewed risk, relying on regulators to decree how much he could charge customers for power. 
But changes wrought by deregulation have turned that profile on its head. The way is now open for women - often without engineering degrees and often with a large appetite for risk - to reach the highest echelons of the industry. 
""When I left Wall Street in '95, most of my peers and colleagues looked at me like I had blown a gasket. It's like, 'What are you thinking about?'"" said V.J. (Verna-Jean) Horgan, president of the energy trading unit of Dallas-based TXU Corp. 
""Since then, there have been innumerable people from Wall Street who have made the transition to utilities."" 
Few women have made it to the top. For the most part, they entered the industry as it approached deregulation in the mid-1990s. But freeing parts of the industry from the grip of government regulation has dramatically altered its landscape, opened new lines of business and attracted people with diverse experiences. 
USING NEW SKILLS 
Joan Freilich, chief financial officer of Consolidated Edison Inc., said utilities have a strong engineering orientation and since much work requires physical power, there have been few women. Seeking a challenge, she joined the New York-based utility long before deregulation, in 1978. 
""I think that up until very recently this has been an industry that hasn't had tremendous change. It's been a very stable industry,"" said Ruth Ann Gillis, the first female chief financial officer of Chicago-based Exelon Corp.. 
Recruited by Leo Mullin - then vice chairman of Exelon's predecessor companies Unicom Corp. and Commonwealth Edison and now chairman and chief executive of Delta Air Lines - Gillis joined the power industry from the health industry in 1997 when Illinois was entering the throes of deregulation. 
Deregulation permitted power companies to branch out into competitive businesses, such as the trading and marketing of power, which required new skills that utility executives generally didn't have. 
Horgan is an example of an executive with those new skills. After working for both Bankers Trust and Merrill Lynch, she joined Consolidated Natural Gas, now part of Dominion Resources, six years ago from Wall Street. 
""My initial transition into the utility industry was in 1995 and that in large part was driven by the ability to apply a lot of the same skills that one applies in a Wall Street environment: deal structuring, strong commercial bent, capital, and commodity coming together,"" she said. 
Other women came from the technical side. Marce Fuller, president and chief executive of Atlanta-based Mirant Corp., had engineering degrees from the University of Alabama and New York's Union College, and then moved into corporate finance. 
""That was at a time when a lot of other people were saying, 'I can't believe you're going to do this',"" she said. ""I didn't have any training, but I wanted to learn that part of the business and felt very strongly about making that move and it was absolutely the right thing for me to do."" 
MORE DIVERSITY EXPECTED 
Women executives said as management becomes more accepting, more women will follow in their footsteps. 
It helps that most utilities have at least one female director, though few have more than one, according to executive recruiter Spencer Stuart's Utility Board Index study for 2000. 
Currently, 92 percent of utilities included in the study have at least one female board member, about normal for companies that make up the top 500 publicly traded firms. Con Ed bucks the trend with four women, including Freilich, on a board of 12 directors. 
And for all the men who hold positions of power, the industry seems to suffer from little sexual discrimination, on an official basis anyway. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said there were 25,194 sex-based charges, including sexual harassment, filed across all industries in fiscal year 2000. The utility sector comprised less than 1 percent of that total. 
""One of the reasons we don't have more diversity is that people are most comfortable with people like themselves,"" said Freilich. ""When I first came to Con Ed, men were managers."" 
But that is slowly changing. ""Over time when the opportunities in utilities ... are better understood, you're going to see, by definition, more women, more African-Americans, more Hispanic-Americans, Asian-Americans who will be recruited to be part of the leadership of the companies that today may not be as diverse,"" Gillis said. 
Many of these women are doing what they can to help their female colleagues. That impulse may stem partly from the legacy of support of the all-women's college, which Freilich (Barnard College), Gillis (Smith College), and Horgan (Wellesley College) all attended. 
Fuller is proud of the number of women in charge of various business units at the Atlanta-based company. ""It is true to say that every one of them have been put in these positions since I got this job.""

Alaska Producers Say Gas Pipeline Would Be Too Expensive 
A natural gas pipeline to the Lower 48 states from Alaska would be too expensive to build and too risky, according to a preliminary study by Exxon Mobil Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co. and BP Plc, the three largest lease holders along the North Slope. The producers told Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles' natural gas development team at a meeting last week in Anchorage that the project looks like a long shot at best. 
The proposed pipeline would yield a rate of return on investment of about 10-11%, far less than the 15% sought by the producers. Neither the Alaska Highway route nor the Mackenzie Delta route would provide attractive enough returns to justify the enormous up-front costs associated with such a massive construction project, according to preliminary analysis by the producers. 
The Alaska Highway Route, which is favored by state legislators because it would bring in more tax dollars, provide in-state jobs and have less environmental impact would cost about $17.2 billion. The significantly shorter route under the Beaufort Sea and south through Canada's McKenzie River valley would cost about $15.1 billion, the companies said, according to the report. 
Exxon, Phillips and BP are still examining their findings but clearly consider the project a long shot. Nevertheless, they are still willing to examine potential cost cutting measures, such as reducing construction costs and streamlining the permitting process to avoid delays. 
""Despite how some of the press are portraying it -- that the producers have scrapped the idea (the Canadian press was writing the obituary on the Alaska highway gas line yesterday) -- reports of its demise are greatly exaggerated, to borrow a phrase,"" said Knowles spokesman Bob King. ""Actually I think there is some good news in what they said. They talked about the project not meeting their goal of a 15% rate of return, but they did say it was profitable. In fact, they said it would provide a 10-11% rate of return. I think that portends well for the project. 
""There's still a challenge and there are issues to be dealt with to make this project more economic,"" King added. ""There are some steps the state can take to address some of the risk, but I think the fact that their projection that the gas line is profitable bodes well for the project. They didn't say this project is over. There still is a tremendous resource that is there. There's still a tremendous national need."" 
The governor is going to be in Washington, DC, this week to testify Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. ""He'll talk about his proposals, which include some financial incentives in terms of investment tax credits and the like in order to help make this project economically viable,"" King said. ""He's also mentioned accelerated depreciation and also some potential tax credits if gas prices turn south."" 
King noted the governor and the Alaska legislature are still vehemently opposed to the Mackenzie Delta route. Alaska has passed a law essentially blocking that route. ""The governor has always supported the Alaska Highway route. He thinks the over-the-top route is a nonstarter. There are too many logistical and environmental concerns that I don't think can ever be resolved in order for it to happen. There is a lot of opposition within the state from the Eskimos who depend on the Beaufort Sea for subsistence whale hunting. They've made it very clear that they would strongly challenge any such project even though this is a group that is very supportive of responsible development on the Slope. They want to make sure it's done in an acceptable manner, one that doesn't threaten their traditional lifestyles."" 
Another main criteria is making sure that Alaskans have access to the gas itself, King added. The over-the-top route would bypass the Alaska market entirely. ""That's clearly not acceptable.""

Azurix Abandons Argentine Concession 
Azurix, a unit of Houston-based Enron, has decided to abandon its $440 million, 30-year concession to operate drinking- and waste-water services in Buenos Aires province and is trying to recover all investments made there in the past 26 months, a company spokesman said. In addition, Enron and Azurix will seek ""some level of damages in addition to the money we've spent,"" said John Ambler, Enron's spokesman for its Latin American operations. On Sept. 19, the company filed a claim with the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes in Switzerland against the Republic of Argentina to make sure ""that all of our rights are protected,"" he said. 


INDIA: Tata Power said in talks to buy India Enron stake.

10/01/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 1 (Reuters) - India's largest private utility, Tata Power Company, is in preliminary talks with Enron Corp to buy the U.S. giant's stake in the troubled $2.9 billion Dabhol Power unit, Indian media reported. 
The Economic Times said in a weekend report that Tata Power , a unit of India's second-largest conglomerate, would start final negotiations with Enron after the consultants it had appointed to value the project submitted a report.
It said JM Financial and Ernst & Young had been appointed to carry out a due diligence exercise. 
The paper quoted Tata Power Managing Director Adi Engineer as saying his company would ""demand Enron scale down the (selling) price"" to make it viable to buy the stake. 
Engineer was not immediately available for comment. 
The Financial Express said in an unsourced report on Saturday that Tata Power and Enron were close to an agreement on the stake deal. 
Indian financial institutions and banks, which have lent around $1.4 billion to the project, are coordinating efforts to find a buyer for Enron's stake. 
""Our search for a viable partner is on,"" a source from a domestic lender told Reuters. 
He said Tata Power officials met P.P.Vora, chairman of state-run Industrial Development Bank of India - the biggest lender to the project - and Enron officials last Thursday to start negotiations. 
Enron has a 65 percent stake in the embattled project, Indian state utility Maharashtra State Electricity Board owns 15 percent and General Electric Co and Bechtel Corp. each own 10 percent. 
Dabhol has faced problems ever since it was forced to shut its 740 MW plant on the west coast of India in June after its sole customer, a local state utility, stopped buying power. 
It had also defaulted on earlier payments. 
The shutdown has stalled an expansion programme, which was almost complete, that would have raised the capacity to 2,184 MW. 
Tata Power shares were down 1.5 percent at 98.80 rupees while the Bombay benchmark index was down 0.65 percent in morning trade.

Cong, NCP differ over Enron probe panel issue
Prakash Joshi

10/01/2001
The Times of India

MUMBAI: The delicate relationship between the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party has been stretched to a breaking point following differences over the appointment of a retired Supreme Court judge to head the panel to probe into the Enron issue. 
According to sources, the state government has completed necessary paper work after the state cabinet decided in principle to go for a judicial commission.
The NCP leadership is upset about the speed with which the commission is being constituted by the state administration. The NCP wanted to go slow with the idea. 
On Friday, chief minister Deshmukh held a closed door meeting to decide on two issues whether to defer the constitution of the judicial panel and the NCP criticism on the chana dal and other issues aired after the Baramati conclave was convened by the party last week. 
Though Deshmukh was not available, Congress sources confirmed that the cabinet was unanimous over immediate constitution of the commission. 
""If the government is seen as buckling under the NCP's pressure and delaying the judicial probe, then it will send a wrong signal to people, a senior Congress minister observed Saturday, adding, ""We will not do anything to stop the process in midway"". 
The NCP leadership, too, is under pressures from other constituents of the Democratic Front ruling the state, especially the Peasants and Workers Party and the Janata Dal (Secular), on the issue. 
At one stage, the senior PWP minister Ganpatrao Deshmukh had even threatened to resign from the cabinet if the probe was delayed, and Chhagan Bhujbal, deputy chief minister, had to agree with the cabinet committee on the proposal for the commission. 
The hawks in the NCP wanted the party oppose the move, but the moderates noted that any opposition to the probe would give the impression to the masses that the NCP had something to hide. 
The NCP has been arguing since the Prime Minister himself was trying to sort out the differences with Enron, the state cabinet should not hurry up with appointment of the judicial commission and, thereby, close doors for negotiations.

"OBA & Scheduling Alt FT by Price Tariff Filings","In an effort to get cash in the door for TW and to maximize revenue opportunity for TW in the coming year, I think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the FERC as soon as possible. 

One would be the OBA filing we have been discussing (and trying to support with historical data) to get automatic cash-out on OBA's in ""constrained"" areas on TW.

Second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate FT points.  This may be the time (the market to California is not so hot) to try to implement this.  I know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them.  

Glen is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the OBA tariff filing.  Could we discuss scheduling alternate FT by price at the same meeting?

"RE: Paper Situation","It has come to the attention of the Dedicated Information Technology Programmers Addicted to Caffeine that we are somehow getting the short end of the stick in these negotiations.  We are generally used to this, but this is the last straw!  Being an often overlooked faction in these wars, we are however, very powerful.  Unless you provide us with the affricated drinks we require to survive, we will sabotage these negotiations.  We start by asking the following questions:  What are your requirements for paper?  Have you documented these requirements.  What is the cost justification for ordering this paper?  What printers are you using?  Does IT have to support these printers?  That will cost extra money.  What were the different requirements surrounding your use of the toaster?  Do you toast bread and waffles?  What other uses do you have for the toaster?  Anything not specifically included in your written requirements will be rejected as a scope enhancement and will cost more money or cause a delay in the return of your toaster.

To avoid further delays in the negotiations, please deliver bribes in 6-packs of 24-ounce bottles of the following:  Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, RC Cola, Jolt.  These payments should be left in the kitchen refrigerator so that they will be cold when we drink them in the morning.

Remember, paper without a working printer is the wrong print queue.  A toaster without power is a metal storage box.  We have the power and will use it.

We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread forever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad - to those who would resort to such extortion.

Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!

We have your toaster!!!  You'll get it back when our demands are met.
Leave 4 boxes of 8 1/2 x 11 paper (no damn 3 hole punch paper either)
under the TV on the west end of the 39th floor and you'll be toasting
away within a few hours.  This isn't from Craig; we've hacked into his

Getting paper for the floor is out of my hands.  I have had three calls this morning plus a note left on my desk to order paper.
Donna Scott is working with the mail room. 

Our toaster that Rick Dietz bought when we moved down here is missing this A.M.  Has been reported to Facilities who will report to Security.  If anyone knows anything, would you please let me know!

	Tnx, Alma G.

"FROM CINDY OLSON, COMMUNITY RELATIONS: Body Shop Reopening","Good news for Body Shop members! The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002. While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month. Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.)
The overall price increase, coupled with reduced expenses, will enable the Body Shop to reopen and remain open on a cash-neutral basis to meet creditors' requirements. Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee. If you do not wish to continue your membership, please contact the Body Shop to cancel your membership via email only at <mailto:Body.Shop@enron.com>.  Membership information and enrollment forms can be accessed below:  

	   

The Body Shop's new hours will be 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Saturday hours are not offered at this time. 
Although laundry service has been discontinued, towels will continue to be available for your convenience. Once the ongoing membership base and associated revenues have been stabilized to support staffing and housekeeping, exercise classes will be scheduled. We anticipate exercise classes to be available within a few weeks. Massage therapy services will continue and are available by appointment by calling extension 3-3047.  
Whether you are a continuing member or considering new membership, there is no better time for you to take advantage of the Body Shop and to take care of your personal health and well being than right now, at the beginning of 2002.
Your continued support is greatly appreciated.

"TW Tariff changes to allow for Electronic Contracting","Transwestern is getting ready to begin testing their new contract system.  In preparation for implementation of the new system, we need to make changes to TW's tariff to allow the option of Electronic Contracting the same way we did to FGT's tariff when we implemented their new system.  

The new contract system is scheduled to go into production Q1, 2002.

Teb, do we need a meeting, or can you proceed?

"RE: Two proceeding changes","Christi --  I don't think it changes the requirement to file by October 1 either, and we are proceeding under the same schedule.  Several rehearing requests were submitted, including one for ENA/EES.  However, note the following which I sent out in an earlier message to the ENA/EES western commercial and government affairs folks (I noted you deleted your message without reading it.)  I consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this OMB ruling a good sign.  


As detailed in the attached FERC notice, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved FERC's Information Collection Request for ""Reporting of Natural Gas Sales to the California Market"" through the six-month emergency period that will expire on 1/31/02.  (Emergency reporting requirements are automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations.)  However, it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the reporting requirements could be extended.

OMB has advised FERC that, if it decides to request renewal of the Information Collection Request after that date, it must address certain issues as part of its supporting statement (more specifically, ""include an explicit discussion"").  As you may remember, in addition to requesting rehearing of the FERC order, ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems with FERC's estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed collection of information.  We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements, much less keep our records in that manner.  We manage our business on an aggregated basis, and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significant manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale.  We stated that we might even have to hire full-time staff to dedicate to the task.

The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requires FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the reporting requirements past 1/31/02.  (FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through 9/30/02 to coincide with the end date of its mitigation plan.)  OMB questioned the practical utility of requiring disaggregated data when ""commenters"" reported that they did not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way.  OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant data manipulation in order to respond, and the resulting disaggregation would likely be artificial.  OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden estimates after ""consulting with respondents"", and it must provide a list of the names, affiliates, and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted.

FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request.  While we would not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely, it may be that the OMB action will affect their final decision.  At the least, it sends a signal!

Please review the attached work order for the tap and side valve for the new Agave interconnect.  Please forward an email message to Robert Geheb giving him your approval on this work order so that he may begin working with the appropriate people to get the materials ordered.  We are under a very tight time frame and we don't want to loose anytime.  The ""paper"" will follow to you shortly for signiture, but this email approval will keep the process moving.  Also, as soon as we work out the remaining details with Agave on the remaining costs, we will revise the work order to include the items that Agave will be constructing for us as well as provide the economics for the interconnect.  This, too, will be routed to you for your approval.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks, Kim. (X33098)

"FW: San Juan Expansion Options - Small Volume","
Coolers are excluded under the blanket CP82-534-00, because it alters mainline capacity  (Section 157.202 (c)) As Ron mentions, an increase in horsepower, which permits 10 mmcf/d of incremental flow requires a Section 7(c).  

OR ..... do we consider the 10 mmcf/d of incremental flow as an ""incidental"" increase of capacity of mainline facilities and put the coolers  under the blanket??? (See 157.202 - you might want to read the entire 1st par. P. 496 of the regs.)    - kelly

Don't know if you have seen this.....but it looks like it is a hot one.  Depending on how the FERC filing was left and how the air permits are currently configured, this may not need any approvals.  Earl, are you in the lead on this or is Power Systems like on Station 1??

I would like to pursue as quickly as possible the option of adding the coolers to get the incremental 10,000/d. Please proceed with developing a more exact cost estimate and determining from a materials standpoint what  the timing of the project might be. Thanks.

Subject:	San Juan Expansion Options - Small Volume

Marketing requested Planning to review any and all possibilities to achieve small volume expansions through the San Juan lateral.  Several facility scenarios were investigated by Planning which are in the attached Excel spreadsheet.  Most if not all are too costly to justify installing.  However, there is another option that is not listed in the attached that was a late entry.  Discussions with Engineering have determined that by cooling the inlet air to the turbines would increase the available horsepower.  That in turn would increase the station's overall throughput.  Preliminary studies indicate that approximately 10 MMcf/d of additional throughput could be realized if inlet air cooling is installed.  The + 30% estimate for two units would be $600,000.  BIG bargain compared to the options in the attached file.  The facility installation is not a major job but the FERC approval to utilize additional horsepower could take 6 - 9 months.  Other considerations to review would be the air quality permit for the increase in horsepower, and potential environmental clearances to do construction.  Let me know what you think about this suggestion.  Please feel free to call.

Hello Team:
After carefully reviewing the success of our walk, we began to value and understand what needs to be done for next year.  Continuing to be proactive, we are starting today to get ready for next year.  Attached is a list of items split into three categories - 
what we did well 
which areas are identified for improvement 
what sort of new things we could accomplish

By working together, we can continue to produce successful endeavors like the walk.  Everyone was fantastic in time, deed, and effort.  We should feel a great deal of pride.  By the way, feel free to email any additions to the list; I will collect those items and strike a new copy.  I also have new thank you letter text and merge documents for those that wish to thank their contributors.  Email me and I will send the files.

Thanks.

"RE: Gas Daily Table","The subscription is all set-up.  I just put my name as the contact until you decide on the user to receive the e:mail publication.  Also, with taxes the one year subscription totals to $2,154.18 to be invoiced in mid January.  There is no contract needed for a one user access; however, a contract is required for two or more users.  There is also a 10% discount for one additional user and the discount escalates as more users are added in case Enron's contract ends in the near future.

The invoice will be sent to me and I'll give it to Theresa Porter and have her charge it to the balancing tool account unless you want it processed a different way.

Here are the information needed to access the publication and data:

Account Number -- gd9480
User ID		 -- gd9480
Password	 -- florida

Chuck Vannote is the Platts account representative that I've been dealing with and his number is 720-548-5496.  I can get with Chuck earlier next year so he can walk us through their internet and the data table.

Thanks.

I finally got a price quote of $1990 per year on a package deal for one user.  Platts doesn't sell the data without a subsciption to the daily publication. The package includes the daily issues and data(table) and back issues and data. 

Please let me know if you want me to go ahead and sign up for this package. I'll have to let Platts know the user's name and billing information etc...

"*EMCA*","Hello everyone,

We have started an exciting project and would like to let everyone know about it and hopefully get some help with it.  We are asking people to donate their aluminum cans and the proceeds will be used to recycle a house for Habitat For Humanity.

Monday morning between 6 and 8 am on channel 26, they are airing an article about the project.  It should be an interesting article.  They have interviewed Dave Daniel's, Director of Development for Habitat, me inside the trailer where we put the cans and a woman that is receiving a house. The Houston area is throwing away enough aluminum cans to sponsor 116 houses.  We only recycle 51% of the cans sold.  It takes 95% less energy to recycle than to mine and produce new. 

If anyone would like to talk to me about this project, please give me a call at home:  713 522-3123 or at work:  J D Metals 832 467-3199.

"Re: *EMCA* Mosquitoes","All the many neighbors in the energy industry appreciate
this further utilitization of gas resources!  Ah, the
wonders of hydrocarbons.

My question for Nathalie is : how long did it take you to
count the 20,000 mosquito carcasses?

My request for Gayle is: please keep away from our house as
we do not need a mosquito magnet drawing them over to our
place.

In honesty though, the mosquitos were really bad when it was
wet out but I haven't seen one in weeks.  Maybe the problem
is just people opening doors and windows to the cooler
weather and letting them in the house.  Time to check those
screens!

"GISB Update","Due to the additional activity within ETS and the holidays, we will not hold a GISB Update meeting during the remainder of this year.  Hopefully we'll get back on a schedule after the first of the year.  Below is my update on a few GISB matters.  We'll go into more detail at our next meeting.

ENERGY INDUSTRY STANDARDS BOARD (EISB)
The GISB Board of Directors has approved revisions to GISB's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to incorporate language necessary to transition to the new organization, which will address standards for wholesale and retail gas and electric transactions.  The new organization, which goes into effect January 1, 2002, will be named the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB).  The wholesale gas quadrant, which is now GISB, should continue with business as usual.  In January, I'll give a more detailed update on the workings of NAESB.

GISB REPRESENTATON
Stan Horton's term on the GISB Board of Directors expires December 31, 2001.  Shelley Corman will take his place on the Board.  Her term expires December 31, 2003.
My term as a representative on GISB's Executive Committee expires December 31, 2003.

ORDER 637 TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING
The development of the new transactional reporting datasets for use on EBBs is almost complete.  The EBB implementation should be included in the next publication, which is scheduled for July 31, 2002.  This is probably a firm date.  The EDI implementation is now a lower priority, but will still be developed.

GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS AND ERRATA
Two separate errata have been developed for the version 1.5 standards.  The errors in the standards books are extensive.  The errata are posted alongside the books on the GISB homepage and have been distributed internally to all who received standards books.  I am working to have GISB correct the standards books.  Some people want to hold off and incorporate the corrections into the next version.  Our implementation will be much smoother if we don't have to continually refer to the errata along with the standards books.  I'll let you know what is decided.


Thanks,
Theresa

I'm a little concerned with making a big deal about this.
However, I put in language which addresses the fact that the issue is outside the scope of the proceeding.
See what you think.

Elizabeth, I haven't heard back from you to get input on the final language.
Please look at the last paragraph and make sure I have said it right.

We can make a broader distribution after you both have had a chance to look at the letter.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee.

"Bus Pass and Parking Information","
FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.

Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month

Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

We are willing to sit at the table and negotiate.  SADIST has pushed us to the brink!  We have infiltrated the SADIST camp and know are in possession of a toaster, AND blender.  We have joined sides with EPLF to demand that our paper supply stays in high demand.  If our demands are not met by the end of today, we will be forced to sign over all our Enron stock options to your organization.  This will cause your organization to implode!!

We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread forever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad - to those who would resort to such extortion.  If we give in now, we will only encourage such acts in the future.  First our microwaves, then our filtered water dispenser, then our refrigerators will become targets of these evil doers.  Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!

Getting paper for the floor is out of my hands.  I have had three calls this morning plus a note left on my desk to order paper.

Our toaster that Rick Dietz bought when we moved down here is missing this A.M.  Has been reported to Facilities who will report to Security.  If anyone knows anything, would you please let me know!

"*EMCA* Contractors","Just wanted to pass along some names and numbers of contractors with 
which we have had recent success:

1) we recently had a small shed torn down at the back of our property 
(I am sure all of our neighbors cheered the removal of that 
eyesore!).  It was a bit of a challenge to find a demolition company 
that could work in such a small area, but ultimately we found the man 
for the job.  His name is Roger Robichau, and generally he does 
concrete removal, but will also do tear downs like ours (which 
consisted of removal of a tree and a fence as well).  He was right 
out to give us a quote, which was very reasonable, and he did a good 
job.  No complaints at all.  His cell # is 713-823-0204, and his 
pager is 713-788-3784.

2) the fence that was torn down was replaced by a company called 
Decks for Less, owned by Jimmy Turner.  They beat out the larger 
companies (likely because they could be more competitive on this 
small job - the big guys were hitting us with the ""minimum charge"").  
He came out right away, and had the fence up (50') in a day.  Again, 
very reasonable, and very tidy - I have hardly found any overlooked 
screws or nails, which is a big bonus with a little one running 
around the back yard.  His number is 713-499-1560.

3) late this past fall, we had a wrought iron fence and driveway gate 
installed by AA Ornamental, owned by Calvin Raley.  They did a good 
job, their price was very competitive, and a big plus - as the fence 
has shifted and settled, he has come back out to make adjustments.  
No problem at all getting him to follow up.  He has also done the 
fence installation around the new townhomes at the corner of Welch 
and Morgan, if you want to see other examples of his work (that one 
is more elaborate than ours - take a look at the back of the property 
to see the ""creative stuff"".  His numer is 281-354-2659.

"Re: *EMCA* An arrest","You know, this neighborhood bulletin board is really a good thing!

And last night while I was at the Christmas party at the HPD Neartown
storefront, someone told me of having just seen four or five cop cars down at
the Blockbuster at Montrose surrounding a white car with several black men.
I wondered if it could be the folks who've been running our little crime
wave.  Incidently, while at the party, I heard of two stories where folks
with automatic garage doors here in Montrose but outside of EM had gone into
their garages and wound locked up with a pair of gun-toting robbers who took
their wallets and purses.  Sadly, in one, the guy was killed (this one was in
the past 2 or so months).  So there is bad stuff going around.

"Outlook Tips","
The following information and tips are provided to assist you as you're working with Outlook:

The Outlook mail file size restriction has been removed.  However, if you have ever submitted an eRequest for additional space, you will need to forward an email to the ETS Solution Center to have the email restriction lifted.

The steps listed below will allow you to turn off the Auto-Delete feature, so that your mail will not be deleted as you exit:
		Go to your inbox,
		Select tools,
		Select options,
		Select the ""other"" tab,
		Deselect the check box that says ""empty deleted items folder upon exit"".

You might want to consider creating a folder called 'Junk' or 'Undecided' for any non-business-related information or any retained items you don't want to clutter your normal folder structure.  

Regarding quarantined email messages:
Inbound - For inbound quarantined messages, a ticket needs to be opened with the Resolution Center, 713-853-1411.
If the intended email is of valid business-related content and you believe it requires Enron resources to retrieve it, the Help Desk will open a ticket to have the email released from quarantine and delivered to your e-mail Inbox. Your message will be scanned and checked for viruses prior to requested release.  If it contains a virus or there is reason to suspect it is malicious code, it will not be delivered.
Outbound - For outbound quarantined messages, an e-mail needs to be sent to IT Security and Controls (itsecurityandcontrols@enron.com) with the recipient's address and the subject line of message.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to call us at:

Rod and Tracy,

As a result of a state of Colorado audit TW has been assessed tax (+penalties and interest) for compressor fuel use ($.4mm), and on the purchase of a La Plata facility ($1.3mm). We are protesting. However, it has been recommended, and I concur, that we pay
the compressor fuel use assessment (""under protest"") to stop interest accruals on the use tax assessment. We believe the sales tax assessment is at best -weak- and therefore do not recommend any payment.

We're requesting approval to cut a check to the Colorado Dept of Revenue for $356,736.95.  
This payment would be a deferred expense until the protest is fully resolved.

Oil companies say North Slope gas pipeline too pricey

09/27/2001
Associated Press Newswires 
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. 

ANCHORAGE (AP) - Oil companies looking into the feasibility of building a natural gas pipeline from Alaska's North Slope to the Lower 48 say the project is too pricey. 
A preliminary analysis of the proposed project by Exxon Mobil, BP and Phillips Petroleum shows that the pipeline project would not provide them with what they want; a 15 percent return on their money.
The project works out to a 10 percent to 11 percent rate of return. 
""We see this as a very high risk project,"" Robbie Schilhab of Exxon Mobil told Gov. Tony Knowles' natural gas development team meeting this week in Anchorage. 
Schilhab and Phillips Petroleum's Joe Marushack presented their preliminary conclusions at a task force meeting. 
Whether the pipeline runs north through the Arctic Ocean to Canada's Mackenzie River delta or south along the Alaska Highway through Canada to the Lower 48, the answer is the same: for now, the project looks too expensive for Alaska's oil companies to undertake. 
For both the northern Arctic route and the southern Alaska Highway route, the costs would be huge: $15.1 billion for the offshore route and $17.2 billion for the highway route. 
""I think this could be made attractive to a number of investors,"" said Ken Thompson, a former oil company executive who sits on the governors' natural gas team. Thompson said that tax incentives, a lower return on investment and a higher value for liquid natural gas from the pipe would make the project a worthwhile investment. 
If the oil companies are not interested, natural gas transportation companies such as Williams, El Paso or Enron might be, Thompson said. 
Exxon, Phillips and BP are still refining their analysis of the project. But the two executives made clear that they consider the project a long shot both for its high costs and high risks. 
Schilhab said that opportunity remained to make the project an attractive investment by cutting construction costs. The companies also want to streamline the permitting process to avoid delays. 
The presentation dented but did not destroy the optimism of the governor's gas council. 
""I don't like seeing the number. But it's a lot different from saying no way, no how, we're shutting our doors and going home,"" said Pat Pourchot, state commissioner of natural resources. Pourchot said that the producers' position underlined the need for incentives like federal tax breaks similar to those being proposed by the Knowles administration. 
Exxon, BP and Phillips are split on the incentives. To address the risk of low prices, Phillips wants a tax credit if prices fall below a certain level. BP and Exxon say they want a project that is viable without tax breaks. 
Federal legislation is slated for consideration next week in Washington, D.C.



INDIA: State-run Indian firms don't want Enron's assets.

09/27/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

NEW DELHI, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Leading state-run firms have rejected proposals from financial institutions to acquire assets of U.S. energy firm Enron's Dabhol Power Co, officials said on Thursday. 
Enron wants to sell its 65-percent stake in Dabhol Power Co which is embroiled in a payments dispute with a local utility.
Officials said some financial institutions had suggested National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Oil and Natural Gas Corp and Gas Authority of India Ltd could buy the troubled Dabhol Power Co's assets. 
NTPC Chairman C.P. Jain told reporters the company had written to the federal government that it was not interested in the project. ""We don't think it is a commercially viable proposition for the organisation."" 
Officials said financial institutions had also proposed that ONGC and GAIL could buy the LNG import and regasification facilities of the Dabhol plant south of Bombay. 
ONGC Chairman Subir Raha said ONGC was not interested. ""Right now it is not on our table. We are not considering it,"" he told reporters. 
Dabhol's first phase has a generating capacity of 740 MW. It has been idling since May when Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), its only customer, stopped buying power saying it was too costly and that Enron had violated a part of the contract. 
Dabhol's second phase was 97 percent complete when further construction was stopped because of the dispute. 
The first phase used naphtha as fuel, but the second phase, that will have a generating capacity of 1,444 MW, will use LNG as fuel.



The Hindu-Editorial: Muddying a quagmire

09/27/2001

Fin. Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire. The Hindu Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'd 

ANY FAINT HOPES about the murky Dabhol Power Project crisis being sorted out by the contracting parties - the Enron Corporation, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the State Government and the Centre which provided the sovereign guarantee in favour of Dabhol Power Company - now appear to have been ruined by the Maharashtra Government's resort to ""the theatre of the absurd"". 
The decision of the Vilasrao Deshmukh Government to have a judicial probe into the entire Enron deal abinitio is not a mere exercise in evasion of the responsibility of the State Government to strive for a process of renegotiation of the contract perceived to be loaded against the virtually bankrupt MSEB (which is unable to pay for power purchased from the Dabhol Plant-Phase I); what is involved is a brazen blackmailing strategy through which the State Government perhaps hopes to drive the Enron Corporation down to its knees to settle for an exit course at a substantial discount on its equity stake, estimated at $1.2 billion. The Centre is not blissfully unaware that its own obligation as a surety for the State Government is now seen as an empty promise with all its pervasive adverse image of the country as an undependable and vulnerable investment destination.
The reported remark of the Union Minister for Power, Mr. Suresh Prabhu, that the new twist to the Enron tangle is ""unfortunate"" but that it would not affect foreign investments in the future, in the power sector in India, is indeed adding insult to injury. 
The script, as it is unfolding in the Enron muddle, can leave nobody in doubt that from the very beginning the contract has had a large element of political manipulation driving it. The allegation that the Enron Corporation was able to manoeuvre itself into a power purchase agreement which was decidedly exhorbitant in power tariff owing to the ""padding"" of capital cost and the denomination of tariffs in U.S. dollar terms (apart from the use of naptha as feedstock) is said to have been corroborated by the Madhav Godbole Renegotiation Committee set up by the State Government. Assuming that a whole chain of bureaucratic scrutiny from the Power Ministry at the Centre down to the MSEB, over a four-year period, did not unravel the odious features of the Enron contract, how does it exonerate the MSEB, the State Government and the Centre now, from non-compliance with the contract in its different stages? 
Political muck-raking, which is what is now being sought to be substituted by the Vilasrao Deshmukh Government (with the tacit approval of the Congress High Command) for an honourable modusvivendi on the Enron imbroglio, can never pass muster so long as the arbitration clause in the Enron contract cannot be wished away. It would indeed be a reckless misadventure for the Vajpayee Government to let the Maharashtra Government renege on the power purchase agreement with the Dabhol company and simply watch the disintegration of India's first-ever and much-vaunted mega power plant put up on the basis of foreign investment. Given the deplorable inadequacies in the power infrastructure in the country even after ten years of liberalisation and the demonstrated incapacity to add even 5000 MW of power generation capacity a year, it would be utter folly to abandon the Dabhol project without its full capacity of around 2000 MW being leveraged for the industrial advancement of the country. 
Reports indicate that the U.S.-based Enron Corporation has expressed a desire to quit from the Dabhol project. The Indian financial institutions which have a substantial exposure to the capital cost of the project cannot afford to wait in supplication for some miracle to happen for the Dabhol project to stay afloat. It is no less a challenge to them as to the Vajpayee Government to find a way out of the morass. Let the project be revived as an earnest of India's commitment to development rather than be rubbished as a monument of political corruption.



NGI's Daily Gas Price Index

Wood Signals That El Paso's FR Contracts Are High on Agenda 
FERC denied rehearing of a June order that permits Arizona Public Service Co. to assign its full-requirements (FR) capacity contract on El Paso Natural Gas to affiliate Pinnacle West Energy to serve a new gas-fired generation facility that it is building in Arizona. On the surface, it seemed a clear victory for the companies involved. However, Chairman Pat Wood made it very clear that he has concerns about FR service on El Paso, which entitles customers to unlimited capacity at frozen rates, and that he plans to take up the issue at a later date. 
""I will reluctantly go along with the order denying rehearing, but [I] look forward very aggressively to a forum in which we can address the capacity concerns"" on El Paso, Wood said Wednesday during a marathon Commission meeting, the first over which he presided [CP01-90, RP00-336]. The proper forum for discussion of the FR service will be El Paso's Order 637 proceeding, he noted. 
As a lawyer, ""it's hard for me...to find an excuse to grant rehearing here. Because this is not the appropriate docket to do that, I will concede that after four months of being browbeat into submission...that sometimes you ought to fold up,"" Wood said. ""But I remain concerned about the [interplay] on the pipeline that if we don't engage in some long-term planning,"" the situation could ""lead to a bedsore for the customers out there in the Southwest."" 
The new chairman made clear that he was not ""a fan or supporter of 10-year rate freezes or any extended rate freezes"" that are made available to certain FR customers. ""I understand that there's a tremendous disincentive here because of that for needed expansions to occur,"" Wood noted. 
He openly invited parties to challenge at the Commission the limits of FR service. He noted that FR customers ""seem to have an unbounded upper-end, which I would love the opportunity to [address] if we ever get a contested pleading to define exactly just how full full-requirements can be."" 
The ""interplay"" of frozen rates and unlimited access to pipeline capacity in a ""growth part of the country that needs to have generation [makes for] a very complicated pipeline scenario,"" Wood said. 
In the June order, FERC gave the go-ahead for El Paso to construct and operate two delivery points and about six miles of lateral pipeline to provide service to the proposed gas-fired electric generation facilities of Pinnacle West and Duke Energy Maricopa LLC in Maricopa County, AZ. Pinnacle's 2,120 MW Redhawk power plant will require about 410 MMcf/d of gas, while Duke's 1,000 MW Arlington Valley plant will burn 210 MMcf/d. Both plants have scheduled in-service dates of June 1, 2002. 
Major producers and other El Paso shippers attacked El Paso's plan to provide FR service of 410 MMcf/d to the Redhawk plant, arguing that the service would further constrain an already capacity-tight El Paso system. Specifically, they objected to El Paso's plan to assign the FR contract (66,042 MMBtu/d) of Arizona Public Service to affiliate Pinnacle West Energy, as well as give a ""huge increase"" in the contract amount in order to serve the Redhawk plant. The protestors further argued that the plan would give Pinnacle West Energy a competitive rate advantage over existing contract-demand customers on the pipeline. 



Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company Building New Pipeline

09/27/2001 
Business Wire 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire) 
BISMARCK, N.D.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 27, 2001--Calling it the ""largest pipeline construction project in company history,"" executives from Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company announced today their intent to file for federal regulatory approval to construct 245 miles of 16-inch natural gas pipeline spanning sections of Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota. 
The pipeline, expected to begin approximately 14 miles north of Gillette, Wyoming, and end south of Killdeer, North Dakota, initially would be capable of transporting from 80 to 120 million cubic feet of gas per day. ""Additional pipeline transportation capacity could be added incrementally as natural gas production grows in the coalbed and other conventional fields in Wyoming and Montana, ultimately increasing the pipeline transportation volumes on this pipeline to as much as 200 million cubic feet per day,"" said Tony Finneman, executive vice president and general manager of Williston Basin. 
""In essence, we're looking to construct a `just-in-time' pipeline for the amount of natural gas being produced in the Powder River Basin, and we'll add capacity in step with increases in production,"" said Finneman, who announced the project today during the Fifth Annual Wyoming Natural Gas Fair in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Initially, the pipeline is expected to feature three large compressor stations - one on the south end of the route in Wyoming, another in eastern Montana and the third in North Dakota. Additional transportation capacity through the pipeline can be made available by adding more compression facilities. 
The pipeline would transport natural gas from developing coalbed and conventional natural gas production in central Wyoming and south central Montana to interconnecting pipelines that will transport it to large midwestern markets. ""The pipeline would also enhance access to our large natural gas storage facilities in eastern Montana,"" Finneman said. Availability of storage should be an advantage to large-volume consumers, such as utility companies and large industrial facilities, because they can buy natural gas when prices are low and store it for future use. 
Finneman said Williston Basin will be filing the project with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in October. The selection of the pipeline's route is nearly complete and initial surveying work has begun. With FERC approval, construction could begin as early as the third quarter of 2002, with transportation service slated to begin in late 2002. 
Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company provides natural gas transportation and underground storage through a pipeline system in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. Williston Basin is an indirect subsidiary of MDU Resources Group, Inc., a multidimensional natural resource enterprise traded on the New York Stock Exchange as ""MDU.""

"TW v. SoCalGas (Dictation Draft from Greg Porter)","
DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER


I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.  Rick Miles will be the mediator.

The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Miles will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.

Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Once additional information is learned, I will advise.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

"Re: *EMCA* (no subject)","I just turned on the computer and read all of these ""bad news"" notes.  I just wanted to second Ben's comments: this vandalism is horrible.  But as we have discussed in the past, we should not label this an ""East Montrose"" problem - this probably happened all over the area.  Most Montrose neighborhoods have a very unfortunate layout (with respect to theft and vandalism) - almost every street is a cross street, so that people can get in and out of the neighborhood very easily.  

This has been discussed with the Mayor's office in past years, but the ""need for alternate routes out of downtown"" so far has overshadowed issues such as this.

For those of you who were vandalized recently, if you have not reported this to the police, please do so.  It may not seem significant enough right now, but for talks about blocking off streets to resume, documentation about the problems we are having will be essential.

I hope your holidays were wonderful, and wish each of you the best in 2002.

    Neighbors, yesterday four cars were vandalized at Bomar St. The  glass windows were shatered. My cousin from Michigan was visiting me. The window behind the driver's seat was broken. The police was at Bomar and Grant with the same problem. I am sick and tired of this abuse. And yesterday I was also ashamed. It's not only the broken glass is all the secondary effects that this kind of incidents cause to the victim. And the perpetrators are probably laughing at all of us. Because for them is probably a joke. I am sorry of giving all of you this news in this beautiful day but we need to be aware. Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Hedda, 416 Bomar.

"ETS and Corporate Change Control","The following item was presented in this week's corporate change control....

Dec. 28
Beginning at 5:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will remove domain controllers CORPHOU-DCARD02 and CORPHOU-DCARD03 from service to be rebuilt.  These are just two of the numerous active domain controllers within the Corp domain.  There should be no disruption of service as user requests should automatically be redirected to an active domain controller.  Once these servers are rebuilt, they will be returned to the Corp domain.

Dec. 31
From 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will move ECTHOU-HR1 to the Ardmore data center.  This move will result in a total disruption of service for those HR users whose S:\ drive is mapped to this server.

Jan. 7
From 7:00 a.m. through 1/11 at 5:00 p.m., Facilities will perform the annual maintenance on the rooftop chillers.  The chillers will be taken down one at a time during the maintenance.  No impact to ETS is expected.

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"RE: morn meet 1/17/02","
I'm concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance that we've built up again.  Tim - are these numbers verified and up to date.  Can I get a breakdown of the 1.5 Bcf and the 700 MMcf current month portion.   It seems like we just worked down these balances in the fall and now we're building these balances back up again.  

If these supply imbalances are building up as a result of Phase V outages perhaps the payback gas use should be separately captured and recorded against the project.

The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.

Subject:	Duplicate numbers - update

Okay, ladies thanks for your phone messages. Here is where we are with duplicate meter numbers

The 84081 issue does not appear to be a problem for you. There is a meter number 84081 that exists in PLE, but the company identifier is Transwestern, so that should be okay.

the meter numbers that have been used already for Florida are as follows:

86157 - Assigned to ""Aux Perry"" in 7/1/98. Current status is Removed - but I cannot delete it from the history in PLE.  POI 78178 (Mobile Bay to GS) will need another meter number assigned to it.

86158 - Assigned to ""Cottage Perry"" 7/1/98.  Current status is Removed - same issue as above, cannot delete History, so POI 78179 - Exxon Mobile Bay to GS point needs a new meter number assigned.

86106 - Assigned to ""Misc CS#10.  Current status is removed. same issue as above, cannot delete History, so POI 78304 - Calpine Washing Parish Power plant needs a new meter number assigned.

Thanks for your help. Call me if you have questions.

"Re: *EMCA* Saturday Night, Sunday morn","Laura:

I'm not sure you were responding to my own message of earlier today.

We had no break-in--it was a small kitchen fire from an unwatched pot.

If someone on the street is breaking into back sheds, it's probably kids or
itinerants.  Actually, I've found that a resident dog and an alarm system seem
to discourage most would-be break-in's.

ETS State Government Report:

California

I00-11-002  Adequacy of SoCal System.  Since no parties challenged TW's testimony supporting SoCal's receipt point capacity proposal in Opening Comments, Transwestern did not file Reply Comments last week.  Most comments by intervenors focused on other issues such as their open season mechanism, curtailment, backbone transmission capacity addition planning, slack capacity and barriers to new interstate pipeline service.

A01-09-024  On Sept. 21, 2001, SoCalGas filed its Biennial Cost Allocation Proceeding (BCAP) application.  The purpose of the filing is to revise rates to reflect the updated allocation among customers of non-gas commodity costs of service effective January 1, 2003.  In addition to the required rate revisions, SoCal requested authority to revise and simplify various tariffs and to implement several new programs.  Of interest is the proposal for allocation of firm receipt point capacity into their system.  Other  proposals address procedures for open seasons to expand the backbone system, an in-kind fuel charge for transportation and an expansion of the unbundled storage program including gas loaning services.  The application, testimony and exhibits have been distributed to Marketing, Legal and Regulatory for review.  Interventions will be due at the time of the pre-hearing conference which was proposed by SoCal to be held in late October.

Infrastructure Report.  The California Energy Commission approved its Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report on a 4-0 vote after several months of discussion and revisions to various drafts.  Most recently certain commenters encouraged the CEC to include an assessment of El Paso's impact on prices through market power and manipulation.  Instead the CEC report references the FERC proceedings addressing this issue and the fact that the CPUC which filed the complaint will represent the interests of California ratepayers.  Numerous factors are addressed as contributing toward the high prices experienced during the last heating season, these included insufficient receipt point takeaway capacity within California, insufficient capacity on the El Paso pipeline system, high demand for gas fired electric generation, low storage levels and extremely dry weather conditions which led to lower hydroelectric output.  Recommendations included encouraging additional in-state gas production, re-evaluate design criteria to expand intrastate systems, encourage the creation of new and independent storage facilities and revise curtailment rules.

New Mexico

01-121-PL  The rescheduled Sept 12th public meeting on the NMPRC's Safety NOI was held last week.  Rick Smith made the TW presentation.  Albino Zuniga, the lead NMPRC person did not attend.  Participation was low and uneventful.

"*EMCA* That Awful Pile on the Bomar/Montrose Esplanade","For weeks we've all wondered about that unsightly dirt pile with rebar
sticking up and whether the City would actually do something about it.

Well, I mentioned it last Thursday to Rick Ehrlich, the builder who is
doing that project between Bomar and Peden (and who also did that
terrific renovation of Las  Brisas at Stanford and Fairview).  The next
day he had his crew remove it.  Nice gesture from a local builder  and
neighbor.

"RE: *EMCA* Mosquitoes","Hi Carmen, 

The mosquito spray you can get at Lowe's or Home Depo. It's one one those that you just hook up to the end of your hose and turn the knob. I found it works pretty well. Just take a couple days or so to work, It come in a gray jug (it may be an Orhto product but don't bank on my memory). And yes, I am into arts & crafts. I have a d/b/a Bungalow Life and hope to have an e-business one day and a  gallery studio and business out of my bungalow. I am a reader/student (and collector when I can afford it) of most anything from 1900-1920's. Hope to talk to you some time. I am at 906 Bomar.

What is the spray that you hook up to your garden hose?
Non-toxic sounds good. Where do you buy it? Thanks!

dissapates. It has worked wonders. There is also a spray that youjust! hook

non-toxic and works really well also.
Let me know if you would like to use the fogger.

"Ethane Content Various Locations July 99 thur July 01","As requested at the meeting, the last couple years of history of our ethane content has been analyzed.  The data provided by Denis Alters were for four locations: Perry from the West Leg side, Perry from the old or East Leg Side, Brooker (East Leg) and West Palm Beach.  

The table below shows the percent of the time the ethane content was above a given percentage at each of the locations.  For example, at Brooker, the ethane content was greater than ( > ) 3% about 25% of the time. 

 

On the East leg, the ethane content has been greater than 2% all of the time.  On the West Leg side, it has been over 2% about 44% of the time, over 3% about 17% and almost never over 4%.  Basically, the West Leg runs about 1.5 to around 2% when all the Destin and Mobile Bay processing is operating.  Even last winter, when running processing plants was not economical, the West Leg gas exceeded 4% only one day.

If you look at the plot below (I hope it comes thru), you can see that thru July of this year,  the West Leg ethane content had not returned to the levels seen prior to the gas price spike last year.  This is consistent with the Btu analyses on Mobile Bay.  Apparently they have the ability to reduce the level of ethane removal when iethane is more valuable as pipeline gas than as a chemical feedstock and are therefore have been leaving more in the gas this year than last.

very aggravating.

"Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles","Based upon our understanding of the request from TW Marketing, here is our suggested position on the posting and awarding of potential take-away capacity at SoCal Needles from approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.

TW would post on its website a notice in the capacity section that, based on information provided by SoCal regarding an expansion on their system, the take-away capacity at SoCal Needless may be increased by __Dth/day for the period of approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.  Shippers would be advised that the actual start date would depend on SoCal completing their system modifications. The posting would say that TW would accept requests for such capacity during a stated period of time (a minimum of 3 business days).  TW would award the capacity to the shipper(s) willing to provide the greatest cost commitment. The greatest cost commitment would be defined as those revenues above and beyond the current revenues which Transwestern already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.

Call me and I'll arrange for us to meet to discuss this further.   sjk

AFTER THE ATTACK 
Minnesota pipeline operators told to increase security

The state of Minnesota has told its 85 pipeline operators to increase security on the 62,000 miles of natural gas and hazardous liquid lines that crisscross the state. 
Pipeline operators were told they should increase patrols and be alert to any unusual activities or packages left near their facilities, said Ron Wiest, chief engineer for the Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety. They were told to maintain the heightened security for the foreseeable future and to notify authorities of any irregularities or suspicions, he said. 
Two-thirds of the state's pipelines carry natural gas. The remainder carry commodities such as jet fuel, crude oil and other hazardous liquids. 
The federal Office of Pipeline Safety sent two security circulars - one right after the Sept. 11 attacks and one on Sept. 14 - to thousands of companies operating more than 2 million miles of pipelines nationwide. 
Wiest said the Sept. 11 circular cited the attacks in New York and Washington, advising pipeline operators that ""their system may be affected by terrorist acts not specifically directed at their facility."" 
The second circular reiterated the threat and advised the companies, which provide their own protection, to institute a heightened level of security and increase personnel. 
Wiest said operators were cautioned not to record or discuss the specifics of their security methods. But it primarily would involve increased patrols and video surveillance, he said. 
A presidential commission in 1997 described pipelines as sitting ducks. 
""The increase in transportation of oil via pipelines over the last decade provides a huge, attractive, and largely unprotected target array,"" according to the report ""Critical Foundations: Protecting America's Infrastructures."" 
""Oil and gas vulnerabilities include lines at river crossings; interconnects; valves, pumps, and compressors; and natural gas city gates,"" the report said. ""Large metropolitan areas could be deprived of critical fuel for an extended period by a properly executed attack."" 
The U.S. Office of Pipeline Safety, a division of the Department of Transportation, said it was unaware of any specific threats to the lines. 
The largest natural gas pipeline operator in Minnesota is Northern Natural Gas Co., a division of Houston-based Enron Corp. About 3,200 of the company's 17,000 miles of pipelines are in Minnesota. 
Most of Northern Natural's pipelines in Minnesota are underground, but they emerge where they enter compressor and meter stations. 
Gina Taylor, spokeswoman for Northern Natural, said it has not received any information about a specific threat to the pipelines. 
Even so, the company has increased staff at all ""manned facilities"" and is keeping in close touch with authorities and the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, a trade group, she said.

Wood's First FERC Meeting Expected to be Long 
Today's regular FERC meeting, the first one over which Chairman Pat Wood III will preside, promises to be a very long and interesting one. In addition to the regular consent agenda items, the Commission has listed a number of administrative issues that will be discussed, including the adequacy of the energy infrastructure, an update on the pipeline capacity situation to and within California, ""strategic and 2002 business plans,"" as well as other items. (AD01-2, AD01-3, AD01-1). 
FERC's long-awaited action Wednesday on its affiliate rule is likely to be the focus of considerable attention (RM01-10). The Commission is expected to plug up the loopholes surrounding the flow of non-public information between regulated energy companies and their unregulated affiliates. 
On the electric side, the Commission also has docketed discussions addressing ""significant national transmission constraints,"" and the progress of regional transmission organizations (EX01-2, EX01-3)). For natural gas, FERC has scheduled discussions of gas pipeline operational flow orders, and the ""efficient and effective collection of data"" (GX01-1, GX01-2). 



Senate to discuss infrastructure security, supply 
Gas Daily
September 26, 2001
In closed testimony today, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is due to review the energy industry's response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Although the hearing is not open to the public, the discussions are likely to focus on measures to protect sensitive infrastructure, including ways to safeguard major pipelines and transmission lines from potential terrorist threats. 
The Senate's renewed focus on energy is also likely to lend momentum to efforts to bolster domestic supply -- including a Republican-led bid to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
Security has been a watchword for the industry since Sept. 11. Although the attacks delayed a number of energy policy initiatives (GD 9/21), Congress is now turning its attention to the issue again. 
Federal agencies have also followed suit. Immediately after the attacks, FERC pledged that it would allow energy companies to recover the cost of any security upgrades made to protect vital infrastructure (GD 9/17). 
Today's hearing will cover a broad range of issues. Representatives from all sectors of the energy industry will deliver testimony; both domestic and international issues will be on the agenda. 
The first panel will feature testimony from Deputy Energy Secretary Francis Blake. A second panel will comprise members of the main energy associations, including the National Petroleum Council, the American Gas Association, Edison Electric Institute, the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America and the North American Electric Reliability Council. 
Scheduled to appear on behalf of the industry are: Robert Gilham, manager of global security for Conoco, representing the NPC; Ralph Beedle, senior vice president of the Nuclear Energy Institute; Laurence Downes, chairman and CEO of New Jersey Resources, representing AGA; Eugene McGrath, chairman, president and CEO of Consolidated Edison, representing EEI; Greg Bilinski, vice president, transmission for Duke Energy Gas Transmission, representing INGAA; and Michehl Gent, president of NARUC. 
Nuclear security is one topic of concern. In response to the attacks, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission advised nuclear power plants to go on high alert; NRC has also launched a review of security regulations. 
But ensuring pipeline security is also a major worry, particularly because the United States depends on cross-border pipeline systems that ship gas from Canada. With that in mind, some in Washington are worried that gas transmission infrastructure might potentially be targeted. 
Earlier this week, Senator Bob Bennett, R-Utah, introduced legislation to encourage information sharing between the federal government and private industry on infrastructure issues. ""With more than 85% of critical infrastructure entities owned and operated by the private sector, voluntarily shared information leads to a more focused understanding of threats and empowers government, industry and private citizens to mitigate risk,"" Bennett said. 
The Critical Infrastructure Information Security Act, co- sponsored by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., would allow companies to voluntarily submit sensitive information to federal agencies while keeping the information confidential. According to the bill's sponsors, information shared with a federal agency for security purposes would be protected from requests under the Freedom of Information Act. 
In addition, the bill would allow for companies within one industry to share information on infrastructure without being subject to antitrust review. The bill would also require the federal government to share information with the private sector in the form of notifications, warnings and strategic analysis. 
The discussions over energy security are also likely to spur more debate over drilling in ANWR. A scant two weeks ago, Republicans and Democrats were gearing up for a fight over President Bush's proposed energy policy. In a statement yesterday, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, urged the Senate to join the House by passing the Securing America's Future Energy Act of 2001. 
""As we stand here together, America understands that the defense of freedom hinges on our energy security. A bipartisan majority in the House knew this before the terrorist attacks on September 11. That's why we came together to pass the Securing America's Future Energy Act of 2001,"" said DeLay. ""We all understood the vital security and stability improvements it carried for our energy needs."" 
DeLay said opening up ANWR to exploration and production would be ""one important step"" in that process. 
""Opening ANWR could meet the daily energy requirements of our armed forces for an entire year. Look at it another way; it could replace all the oil from Iraq for the next fifty years,"" he said. ""We can't wait another day. The strength of our security, the health of our economy, rests on expanding our domestic energy supply immediately.""


Pipeline operational update
Gas Daily
September 26, 2001
Reliant Energy Gas Transmission's Amber Compressor Station will require unscheduled maintenance beginning at 9 a.m. today. This work will take approximately three days to complete. Effective today, all interruptible and secondary firm supplies of gas flowing from west of Amber Station to markets east of the station will be reduced to zero for the duration of the work. For the month of October, El Paso Field Services will have approximately 20 million cfd of delivery space available to Transwestern Pipeline through its Carlsbad-Transwestern interconnect at meters 14873 and 78093. The company said shippers may flow gas to Transwestern provided the gas has been properly nominated in EPFS Star Web system for the next day's flow and a corresponding take away nomination has been confirmed with Transwestern.	




Utilities, refineries, pipelines step up security Energy But experts say facilities in Southern California and elsewhere were not designed to thwart terrorists. Series: utility.0923

Although utilities, refineries and gas pipelines have stepped up security in the wake of the terrorist attacks Sept. 11, experts say Southern California -- and the country -- are still vulnerable to attacks from determined terrorists. 
Built in the 1950s and '60s, long before terrorism became a domestic threat, Southern California's refineries, public water supplies, even nuclear power plants are too close to public thoroughfares and too accessible to commonly available assault weapons. 
To date, these facilities have relied primarily on chain-link fences, security cameras and the belief that ""it won't happen here,"" national counter-terrorism experts say. 
Local law-enforcement officials say residents should feel safe. 
Orange County sheriff's officials say they had cataloged and assessed potential targets long before last week's attacks. They moved immediately to step up security for utilities, mass- entertainment businesses and religious facilities, among other vulnerable facilities. 
""The county of Orange at this moment has as much safety resources as at any time in history,"" Assistant Sheriff George Jaramillo said. ""You can never prepare for every eventuality, but we are as safe as we can possibly be."" 
Terrorism experts don't agree. 
""Does the U.S. have sufficient security at its utilities and refineries? No, and you may quote me: No,"" said Thom as L. Preston, a former Army counterterrorism officer who now heads Preston Global, an international security-consulting firm based in Kentucky. 
""We have represented a number of utilities and developed counterterrorism plans for them,"" Preston said. ""But the common view is: It won't happen on my watch."" 
One theory that weighs against terror attacks in Orange County, some experts say, is that terrorists want to make a major spectacle and create as big a disruption as possible. 
Although local officials have identified some 40 ""areas of concern,"" including Disneyland, the San Onofre Nuclear Power Plant, and John Wayne Airport, none of them could create the flaming spectacle of the World Trade Center coming down. 
""Most terrorists want something big, eye-catching, spontaneous -- something that controls the media,"" said David F. Ray, a former Secret Service section chief who now performs risk management for major corporations. 
According to terrorism experts and a survey of Southern California infrastructure, there are still many areas of vulnerability: a major refinery with a public diner and parking lot just across the street. A major power plant with a public animal shelter just on the other side of the chain link. Miles of aqueducts so accessible that people routinely fish in them. A nuclear power plant that fronts on a public beach. 
Federal officials have warned utilities, refineries and pipeline companies to take steps to safeguard their facilities. 
""We would be ignorant to assume we've seen the worst of the worst, that there are not other (terrorist) cells that will be of equal or more devastation to us,"" said Matthew Devost, co-founder of the Terrorism Research Center in Virginia. 
Utilities feel they are well-protected: 
Southern California Edison said it has stepped up security at high- voltage transmission lines and other power facilities. Edison said it can't guard every mile of lines, but ""the transmission system is designed with redundancy in the event of a loss of power or a lost (transmission) path,"" said Steve Conroy, media-relations manager for Edison. 
The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which provides most of the drinking supply from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border, closed public access to its offices and facilities and quadrupled guards at key points. 
Water is being sampled several times daily. Joe Tait, chief operating officer for MWD, said the water supply is so large that it would be difficult to contaminate. 
""You'd need a tremendous amount of some kind of agent to affect our waters,"" Tait said. 
Refineries and fossil-fuel pipelines immediately went on heightened alert after the attacks last week. 
""It's been a situation, ever since the attack, of heightened security and heightened awareness,"" said Larry Pierce of Kinder Morgan, which owns 30,000 miles of natural gas and refined petroleum product pipelines in the United States, including a major pipeline through Southern California. 
""Obviously we are taking precautions."" 


US Physical Natural Gas Prices Fall; Thin Trading Ranges

09/25/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. physical natural gas prices fell slightly Tuesday on light demand, as traders took advantage of cash-outs on pipelines and a small backwardation premium to the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
Cash prices in Florida led the nation, with prices at the Florida Citygate around $2.71 a million British thermal units. Most other pipelines were just under or just above $2/MMBtu. 
""Everything was pretty flat,"" a Texas trader said. Traders in Texas and the Gulf Coast mostly pointed to storage buying and people rushing to next month baseload trading. 
Looking ahead, some incremental demand may be seen next month, as some utilities switch to natural gas from fuel oil and a number of nuclear energy sites go off-line for maintenance, one veteran trader said. 
October, a shoulder month, tends to be a major price discount month, he said. On the Nymex there's currently about a 40-cent difference between the outgoing October contract and the November contract. 
Traders again saw tight ranges Tuesday, as the Nymex's October contract traded under the spot cash bid-ask price, which are both at 30-month lows. 
Traders are in the midst of a three-day monthly bid week as they set baseload pricing for October. 
The Nymex Oct natural gas futures contract rose 1.5 cents to settle at $1.925/MMBtu, near lows seen in March 1999. 
October expires Wednesday. Some traders see the 17,000 $2/MMBtu puts, well above Tuesday's settlement, as a prime reason for short covering Wednesday ahead of expiration and the American Gas Association's storage report. Early predictions are for the AGA report to show a build around 84 billion cubic feet up to 94 Bcf. 
At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, the delivery point for Nymex gas, prices fell 1 cent-4 cents to a $1.93-$1.97/MMBtu closing range. First-of-month index for the Henry Hub is around $2.34/MMBtu. 
Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done at $1.98-$2.09/MMBtu, down 1 cent-2 cents. 
At the Arizona-California Border, where gas from El Paso's pipeline begins delivery to Southern California, buyers paid $1.77-$1.85/MMBtu, down 2 cents-5 cents. Index for September is at $2.66/MMBtu. 
At PG&E Citygate, traders paid $1.88-$1.97/MMBtu, up 5 cents on the bid, down 6 cents on the offer. September first-of-month index is at $2.71/MMBtu. 
At the Katy hub in East Texas, prices were in a $1.87-$1.93/MMBtu range, down 5 cents. First-of-month September index is $2.37/MMBtu. 
At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $1.74-$1.81/MMBtu, down 3 cents-4 cents. Index is at $2.32/MMBtu, traders said. 




INDIA PRESS:DPC,Govt Fail To Reach Stake Sale Pact At Mtg

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) unit, Dabhol Power Co., and India's federal government have failed to reach an agreement on selling DPC's stake in the Dabhol power project, reports the Business Standard. 
After the two-day meeting, DPC refused to accept the government's offer to sell its stake in the $2.9 billion power project at a 20% discount, the report says, quoting unnamed government sources. 
""At the meeting, the two sides remained stuck to their respective positions and haven't made any progress so far,"" the newspaper quoted one of its sources as saying.
According to the report, the government won't take a stake in the 2,184 megawatt Dabhol project located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. The government won't even allow any state-owned company to buy a stake in Dabhol, the report added. 
As reported, Enron, which holds a 65% stake in Dabhol Power Co., threatened to pull out of the project following payment disputes with its sole buyer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, and the failure of India's federal government to honor its payment guarantee for the project. 
Dabhol is the single largest foreign investment in India to date.

Futures Quiet at Options Expire; Traders Look to Storage Report 
Following Monday's 9% price drop, natural gas futures were held to an extremely-tight, nine-cent price range yesterday as traders elected to wait for fresh fundamental data to be released Wednesday. Unable to push to fresh lows or highs, the October contract notched an inside day on the daily chart yesterday, closing 1.5 cents stronger at $1.925. 
Several traders noted that while crude oil futures rallied and then tumbled back below unchanged, natural gas prices remained steady Tuesday. For bulls who have had little to like about the market lately, the lack of follow though to the downside was well received. ""Marginally bullish,"" were the words used by broker Tom Saal of Pioneer Futures in Miami to describe the slight uptick. ""We were unable to probe beneath Monday's low at $1.88 and that is constructive."" 
Another feature of yesterday's trade that failed to spur much in the way of volatility was the expiration of the October options contract. Saal was quick to point to more than 17,000 $2.00 put options that existed as of Tuesday morning that never became a factor during the futures session. ""Sometimes you get option-related buying or selling in the futures market as options players attempt to pin the futures contract near a specific strike price,"" Saal said. Obviously, that was not the case [Tuesday]."" However, Saal believes that those puts may have a latent effect on prices. ""Because those puts were likely exercised, there are some new shorts in this market that may need to cover their positions before the expiry of the October contract Wednesday,"" he reasoned. 
Looking ahead, it goes almost without saying that there are traders out there who are looking to profit off the latest supply data to be released by the American Gas Association today at 2 p.m. (EDT). However, they had better act quickly this week. Last week Nymex moved to extend open-outcry pit trading hours this afternoon from 1:45 p.m. to 2:45 p.m. in order to take advantage of the liquidity surrounding the AGA's release. Nymex is usually open until 3:10 p.m. (EDT) giving traders a full 70 minutes in which to play the market. Today, traders will only have 45 minutes. 
Expectations ahead of the storage report call for a net injection of 80-100 Bcf, which if realized would surpass last year's 77 Bcf injection, as well as the five-year average refill of 75 Bcf. As of Sept. 14 storage was 87% full at 2,757 Bcf, compared to 71% full at 2,325 a year ago. 


Calif Agency Urges Greater Natural Gas Storage, Delivery

09/25/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- California needs to boost its instate natural gas pipeline capacity and underground storage systems to better cope with increasing demand for electricity production and winter heating, according to a report pending before the California Energy Commission. 
""The state will need to monitor the natural gas situation closely to provide an early warning of developing problems in time to take actions to prevent shortages,"" the commission's Electricity and Natural Gas Committee said in a report analyzing last year's high natural gas costs. 
The five-member energy commission will vote Oct. 3 to either accept the report or send it back to the committee for further work, a commission spokesman said Tuesday. 
The unprecedented run-up in natural gas prices late last year was due to a combination of increased demand from electricity generators and colder-than-usual winter temperatures, combined with inadequate instate and interstate pipeline capacity, the report found. 
""The extraordinarily high prices during this period appear to be the result of either the competitive market's rationing of supply through a scarcity premium, or price manipulation through the exercise of market power by market participants, or both,"" the report said. 
""In any case, prices would have been lower if the receipt capacity in Southern California had been greater,"" the report said. 
The findings have some bearing on the California Public Utilities Commission's complaint before the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which alleges that El Paso Corp. (EPG) manipulated capacity on its pipeline system to drive up natural gas prices in the state. 
A FERC administrative law judge is expected to rule on the complaint in early October. 
Whether high prices in California were the result of scarcity premiums, manipulation by a company, or a combination of the two factors ""is beyond the scope of this report,"" the committee report pending before the state commission said. 
California entered last winter's heating season with lower-than-usual gas in storage, and electricity generators were ""indifferent"" to the high gas prices because a ""runaway electricity market"" allowed them to pass the costs through to customers, the report said. 
""These factors would have been exacerbated by the tight infrastructure conditions,"" the report noted. 
The report recommended various actions to increase instate pipeline capacity and stepped-up monitoring of market conditions to provide warnings of future shortages. 
The report also called for greater natural gas storage and increased instate production of gas, as well as development of a curtailment program to reduce demand during shortages.

Producers See Sept. 11 Effect on Winter Gas Demand 
Fueled by a weakened appetite for natural gas in the industrial sector, forecasts of normal weather for winter, bulging storage stocks and a grim economic fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Natural Gas Supply Association projected Tuesday that gas demand will be flat this winter compared to last year. 
Based on a combination of these fundamentals, ""we estimate that natural gas demand for this winter will range from a decrease of 2.1% (250 Bcf) to an increase of 1.5% (175 Bcf) compared to last year,"" forecasted the trade group, which represents major gas producers, in its annual Winter Outlook. 
""Our analysis reveals a dramatically different natural gas market than this time last year, when we were expecting and experienced a rough winter heating season. While the fundamentals that drive the natural gas market all pointed toward higher prices last year, this year's fundamentals reveal a much improved scenario for this winter's consumers,"" said NGSA President Skip Horvath at a press briefing in Washington, DC. 
In short, gas consumers can expect much lower utility bills this winter, according to the NGSA. Although certain ""wildcards"" exist for the short term that could alter some of its forecasts -- such as the prospect of war in the Middle East -- the producer group said it doesn't anticipate these will lead to ""sustained price volatility"" for gas. 
The projection for a 1.5% increase in overall gas demand this winter, to 11.87 Tcf from 11.69 Tcf last winter, was made prior to the terror assaults, NGSA said. But it adjusted its demand figures downward in the wake of the attacks to account for the expected negative impact on industrial gas demand. It now predicts that overall winter gas demand will dip this year by 2.1% to 11.44 Tcf. 
""The events of Sept. 11 will have the greatest impact on natural gas demand in the industrial sector. Before Sept. 11, we estimated an increase in industrial demand of 5.8% (216 Bcf) as industrial operators fuel-switched back to natural gas and increased their output. But in light of these events, it appears that industrial demand could decrease [by] as much as 4.8% (176 Bcf) from last year due to sluggish economic growth,"" the NGSA said. For this winter, it projects industrial gas demand will fall to 3.52 Tcf from 3.7 Tcf last year. 
Due to forecasts of normal weather this winter, residential and commercial demand also is expected to drop by 6.6%, according to the NGSA. The group projects that demand for this sector will dip 395 Bcf to 5.59 Tcf during the winter months. It cautions that the demand figures for the residential/commercial sector could fall further -- by an additional 150-500 Bcf -- if this winter is a mild one. However, ""a repeat of last winter could increase demand for these two sectors [by] an additional 400 Bcf,"" it said. 
The one bright spot, the NGSA believes, will be the gas demand by the electric generation sector. It expects this to rise 338 Bcf to 1.48 Tcf, partially offsetting the losses in gas demand in other areas. ""This increase in demand is due in large part to electric generators switching from distillates back to natural gas because of low prices, environmental compliance requirements, and new electric generation plants coming on line."" 
While coal is a ""strong competitor"" of natural gas in the power generation market, Horvath said he didn't see coal cutting into gas's share of the market in the short term. ""It is not a short-term issue. Coal plants take as long as 16 years to site. Natural gas [plants] take 18 months to two years to site. So natural gas has a strong competitive advantage there...and the price of coal has gone up as well"" in relation to gas. 
The anticipated flat gas demand this winter, combined with high storage levels (estimated to be 500 Bcf higher than last year at the start of the winter season) and a modest rise in production, are sure to put greater downward pressure on gas prices this winter compared to last year, NGSA said. 
Horvath, however, shied away from forecasting gas prices for the winter period. ""We're not going to predict the actual price because nobody knows that."" 
But he said he doesn't believe the current price below $2 will last long. ""We do not anticipate that the lower prices indicating oversupply of natural gas [are] sustainable. The economy will come back. The U.S. will get back on its feet, and we will have that fundamental tightness of natural gas supply,"" Horvath predicted. The ""seeds in a way have been sown"" already for tighter gas supply later. 
Given the prospect for higher gas prices, he believes that projects to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) and to transport gas from Alaska to the Lower 48 states ""will largely go forward."" 
Horvath sees two potential trouble spots this winter -- California and the Northeast. Although California has promised to have its in-state pipeline capacity expanded by the start of winter, he said he still believes ""that's an area to watch."" The Northeast bears watching as well because of the ""colder-than-normal temperatures"" anticipated for that region this winter, he noted. 
Despite current low prices for gas, he said he'd be ""surprised to see many shut-ins"" by producers. What the industry will see, however, is producers ""not exploring as vigorously [or] pouring a lot of money [into] exploration, because that money just isn't there,"" he told reporters. 
The NGSA acknowledged that there are a couple of ""wildcards"" that have the potential to change its projections. ""If military action occurs, it is not clear how it would affect the market. The current [deregulated] natural gas market has only been in place since 1993, after the Persian Gulf War, which provides us with little for comparison,"" the group said. 
A war in the Middle East would have a significant upward effect on crude oil prices rather than gas prices, the NGSA said, but it noted that ""sometimes oil prices can pull natural gas prices up with them."" Should another ""traumatic event"" occur in the United States, ""we do not know how it would affect the market,"" the producer group said. Since Sept. 11, natural gas prices have trended downward.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

"*EMCA* EMCA's Holiday Party, Dec 18th","Please mark your calendars:

Tuesday, December 18th, from 6:30 to 9:00, EMCA will host its first 
December holiday party.  The party will be held at our regular 
meeting place, at 807 Welch.

Dinner will be pot-luck, with Tom Williams of Fox Diner and Cafe 
Zorro providing the main course.  EMCA will provide beverages, and 
entertainment.

Please bring a dish - either a starter/salad, a vegetable, or a 
dessert.

For those who are interested, we will be holding a White Elephant 
gift exchange - a great opportunity to get rid of that what-cha-ma-
jigger that's been sitting around the house (and to get a possibly 
much more interesting thing-a-ma-bob!).

Additionally, clean out your pantries - EMCA will be taking your 
canned good food donations to local charities.

*******

Now, I have a request.  I need some people to help me distribute a 
flyer for the party to the neighborhood, either today, tomorrow, or 
Tuesday.  If you can volunteer, please email me, or call me at 713-
807-7910.

*******

Thanks a million, and we hope to see you next Tuesday!

Happy Holidays,

Amy Barnes
EMCA President

"Flexible Spending Accounts","Many of you have inquired about January reimbursements to 2002 flexible spending accounts.  Aon Consulting, Enron's flexible spending account administrator, has experienced some processing delays.  Aon has encountered difficulty in retrieving spending account deduction information, and some deductions are not appearing in Aon's records.  Enron Benefits is working with our IT group to help Aon resolve this issue.  Also, unprecedented activity at the end of 2001 flooded Aon with year-end claims.  Aon has assured us that 2001 reimbursements are now up-to-date, and that they began processing 2002 reimbursements on Monday, February 4.

Questions regarding flexible spending accounts can be directed to georgia.fogo@enron.com.

"Weekly Report of 2/8/02","California:

I99-07-003 SoCalGas Unbundling.  In addtion to the Southern California Generation Coalition (SCGC), the National Energy Marketers Association has also filed a Request for Rehearing of the unbundling decision.  Filing protests of the Implementation Plan this week were Indicated Producers, TURN, Dynegy, the City & County of San Francisco and SCGC.  

I00-11-002  Adequacy of SoCalGas System.  A number of parties filed comments on the impact of the unbundling decision on this proceeding.  All were in agreement that the CSA has created a system of unbundled, firm and tradable backbone transmission rights on the SoCalGas system and establishes the procedures for allocation of those rights therefore the capacity allocation proposals in the capacity OII are moot.  

Arizona:

Legislature - Gov. Jane Hull has advised lawmakers to either kill a scheduled 5% pay raise for the 50,000 state employees taking effect on April 1, 2002, or risk laying off 2600 employees.  With a 13 percent drop in withholding taxes, the states current revenue deficit is expected to be in the $200 to 250 million range.  Canceling the pay increases would save $24,000 in the current fiscal year and $100,000 next year.  Democrats are trying to save the raises, while the majority Republicans are supporting the proposal and threatening to shutdown the session by Feb. 15th if legislators don't face up to the budget problems and solve them.

New Mexico:

Legislature - Identical House Bill 423 and Senate Bill 369 were introduced this week to fund ($75,000) an update of the 1996 study regarding the economic feasibility of additional natural gas pipeline systems.  The 1996 study found a lack of capacity to move gas east especially from the Northwestern portion of the state.  If the bill is passed, a committee is to provide the results of the study and recommendations to the governor and legislature by December 15, 2002 for consideration in the next legislative session.

House Bill 230 provides for an expanded definition of ""Indian Country"" to include lands subject to ""restriction by the United States against alienation"" (i.e. lands held in fee by a tribe).  As proposed, the new definition would go beyond the current federal definition of ""Indian Country"".  The State Highway and Transportation Dept. Office of General Council has pointed out that if the proposed state law conflicts with federal law, then the federal law will take precedent.  This has been forwarded to Lou Saldano for review.

"Mother's","Hello you all,
I want to let you know that I faxed Mother's receipt for her airline ticket 
to Teb's fax machine. I just spoke with Zelda (Teb's asst.), who said it 
arrived. Diane, could you go to Zelda's office and pick it up? She's in Room 
EB3990. She said she would be there for another couple of hours, but if she 
had to leave before you got there, she'd leave it on her desk in an envelope 
with your name on it.

Mother needs this when she checks in at the airport tomorrow, so could you, 
Pres or Diane, please take it to her tonight? 

I called Mother this afternoon to tell her she didn't need to make the trip 
if she didn't feel up to it, but she said she was already packed and looked 
forward to it. So I think it's going to work out well for all concerned.

Thank you, everyone, for helping me with this. Sorry to have bothered you 
with it but I didn't know how else to get the receipt to her.

Love,
Sandy

  Hi Guys,

  I have a beautiful, 8'+ weeping ficus that has grown way too large for my place.
  These are generally house plants, but I have kept it out in the shade in the yard, and it has veritably thrived on neglect.  It put two roots out of its pot down into the ground during the summer, and these were cut when I brought the plant in during this cold snap.  I don't know if this has hurt it or not.  At any rate, it will need a larger pot.
  If anyone wants it, he can have it.  But... Since I love this plant so much, I may retain rights to recall it, just in case I ever win the lottery and expand into a larger abode.

  I also have a 40gallon long aquarium and stand.  I have offered this to someone already, but if he decides he doesn't want it, I will be glad to give it to anyone who wants it.

  Please let me know.  I will happily deliver either item.

"*EMCA* Mosquitoes","I hate to do this, and do not want to put anyone out, but I need some help.
 
The mosquitoes are terrible.  It is hurting me to look at Kendall (my son) any more, as the number of bites on him have gone into the double digits.
 
I cannot imagine that we are the only ones suffering from these nasty little pests, and I want to do something about it.
 
If any of you have time tomorrow, can you do me this - can you call Harris County Mosquito Control and help me complain?  I figure that if a whole load of us start calling, they won't be able to ignore us.
 
Their number is 713-440-4800.  I get a recording when I call, but their hours are 8 - 5, so maybe we can talk to a live person tomorrow.
 
Thank you for helping me, and ultimately helping everyone.

I talked with Rod about the purpose of the meeting.  Stan wants to start thinking about the assumptions for the 2004 rate case and a ten year Plan.  I will bring the 2002 Plan but it is really a short-term Plan and Rod does not want me to hand out anything.  It is a strategy session.

We assumed in the Plan a rate drop effective 1/1/05.  I would like to review the assumptions behind that with Teb and Blair to better understand how it was derived.  This will be one of the major issues for discussion.

We are asking people to donate their aluminum cans and the proceeds will be used to recycle a house for Habitat For Humanity. Monday morning between 6 and 8 am on channel 26, they are airing an article about the project.  It should be an interesting article.  They have interviewed Dave Daniel's, Director of Development for Habitat, me inside the trailer where we put the cans and a woman that is receiving a house. The Houston area is throwing away enough aluminum cans to sponsor 116 houses.  We only recycle 51% of the cans sold.  It takes 95% less energy to recycle than to mine and produce new.

A platoon of crack Special Forces soldiers have taken the first steps of
reprisal after the incidents in America.

The heroic force, composed of A&M corps graduates, have broken into the dog
kennel area of the A&M Veterinary Science Building and captured all the

"TW Files","Zelda,

I am sending you 18 boxes of TW files via UPS 3 day ground.  11 boxes are miscellaneous files (marked MISC) originally from Ray Stelly and Rebecca Rangel's offices.  7 boxes are TW files that are slightly more important (marked MORE IMPORTANT).  All these files  were sent from Houston to Omaha in approximately 1997.  The ""miscellaneous"" files have never yielded any useful information.  However, I have used the information in the ""more important"" files several times.  I will send the active TW files and information next week.  This will include the TW tariffs, Form 2s, Rate Case filings, FERC correspondence and electronic logs.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

        Considering Teb's comments relative to support activity for more than the Red Rock project then the OH order

Subject:        RE: TW Overhead WO 

We can charge directly but still need some guidance.  For example, it is my understanding that there are 4 WO set up for Red Rock - one for each station to be modified.  Our work is of a general nature, so do we have to further subdivide our charges to each of the stations, or to three of the stations.  Also, some of our time is spent on a general analysis of regulatory strategy involving all capital projects, and it seems like the overhead WO would be appropriate for these charges.  We don't necessarily want to have to have each person charge to 3 or 4 WO for each identifiable capital project and then to 10 or more WO for our general work.  Any specific suggestions, WO numbers, etc. ?

Subject:	FW: Transwestern Pipeline Payment Under Protest (Confirmed PAYMENT BY MAIL ONLY   -  $356,736.95)

Rod and Tracy,

As a result of a state of Colorado audit TW has been assessed tax (+penalties and interest) for compressor fuel use ($.4mm), and on the purchase of a La Plata facility ($1.3mm). We are protesting. However, it has been recommended, and I concur, that we pay
the compressor fuel use assessment (""under protest"") to stop interest accruals on the use tax assessment. We believe the sales tax assessment is at best -weak- and therefore do not recommend any payment.

We're requesting approval to cut a check to the Colorado Dept of Revenue for $356,736.95.  
This payment would be a deferred expense until the protest is fully resolved.

Thought you might enjoy this.


An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk"". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

"*EMCA* The inner city grid","<bigger>Amy,


Sorry I'm just now getting around responding to your comments of December
26:


>Most Montrose neighborhoods have a very unfortunate layout (with respect
to theft and >vandalism) - almost every street is a cross street, so that
people can get in and out of the >neighborhood very easily.  

<bigger>  

</bigger>>This has been discussed with the Mayor's office in past years,
but the ""need for alternate >routes out of downtown"" so far has
overshadowed issues such as this.

</bigger>

I know that 1990's planners--like the people who designed the
Woodlands--thought that old fashioned city grids   were bad, but I think
they're wonderful.  Thieves and vandals are a minority.  The majority of
us should be grateful for the many options we have for getting from here
to there.  If we're rushing down Montrose to a concert at Rice and the
Boulevard looks crowded, we can take almost any right turn to get to
Mandell and a straight hot south.  We can take Dunleavy to Krogers if we
have to drop something off at the post office or Woodhead if we're just
trying to avoid the corner of Montrose and West Gray.


We can get to Southland--Fairview to Morse--without ever getting on a
major thoroughfare.  Lyda's been attending a conference at the Marriot
across from the Galleria and she takes Willard to Sage and then left
directly to the hotel. 


We take different routes justs to see different sites.  And we have
friends we can visit without ever getting on a busy street.  Compare that
to living in the ""planned"" communities out FM1960 where there are often
no connecting streets between neighborhoods and you have to get on FM1960
to get to the grocery store your the bank.  


Now that you're in the big time, Super Neighborhood Scene, I hope you
will point out to the experts that us inner city people don't want gated
communities and circular streets that don't go anywhere.

To SADIST Organization (Just plain ""Sad"" for short) 
You will NOT be able to undermine the EPLF, CCA, and DITPAC presence in the bathrooms, kitchens, Energizer and /or Plaza Java.  We are the largest organization in the Enworld!  We are well-equipped with large communication networks that spread clear across the street.  DITPAC has since joined EPLA and CCA to destroy you inhumane network that does nothing but exploit the ""toaster gap."" Our new cartel will now be known as S.K.I.L.L.I.N.G. (Supreme Knowledge in Living Large in Natural Gas).
These threats you have mentioned below have been sent to the EPLF, CCA, and DITPAC Cartel and we discovered that we don't even use toilet paper or napkins... big threat! 
We will only return the toaster and blender under the following conditions :
1. Paper supply remains in high demand for our organizations. 
2. SADIST group join forces with S.K.I.L.L.I.N.G. to form a kinder gentler Enworld.
and finally
3. Unlimited access to caffeine-laced products for our friends at DITPAC.

The S.K.I.L.L.I.N.G. Cartel

To EPLF and its sympathizers:   Unless the toaster is returned immediately, SADIST will commence an escalating series of  actions designed to bring all such terrorists to their knees.  We realize there may be some collateral damage, and for this we are truly sorry.  But we must end toaster terror forever.  Beginning at 0900 hours on 10 January 2002, SADIST will commence the following series of actions (each subsequent action will commence 2 hours after the preceeding sanction):
1. All deliveries of new business cards will be suspended
2. Napkins and paper towels will be removed from the kitchens
3. Post-it notes will be confiscated from all locations
4. Paper towels will be removed from all bathrooms
5. Toilet paper will be removed from all bathrooms ( Enron stock certificates will be issued for humanitarian reasons)

If the toaster still has not been returned, SADIST will be forced to remove all COFFEE FILTERS from the building, including the Energizer and Plaza Java.  Do not doubt our will to use this ultimate weapon, after all we are SADIST.

It has come to the attention of the Dedicated Information Technology Programmers Addicted to Caffeine that we are somehow getting the short end of the stick in these negotiations.  We are generally used to this, but this is the last straw!  Being an often overlooked faction in these wars, we are however, very powerful.  Unless you provide us with the affricated drinks we require to survive, we will sabotage these negotiations.  We start by asking the following questions:  What are your requirements for paper?  Have you documented these requirements.  What is the cost justification for ordering this paper?  What printers are you using?  Does IT have to support these printers?  That will cost extra money.  What were the different requirements surrounding your use of the toaster?  Do you toast bread and waffles?  What other uses do you have for the toaster?  Anything not specifically included in your written requirements will be rejected as a scope enhancement and will cost more money or cause a delay in the return of your toaster.

To avoid further delays in the negotiations, please deliver bribes in 6-packs of 24-ounce bottles of the following:  Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, RC Cola, Jolt.  These payments should be left in the kitchen refrigerator so that they will be cold when we drink them in the morning.

Remember, paper without a working printer is the wrong print queue.  A toaster without power is a metal storage box.  We have the power and will use it.

We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread forever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad - to those who would resort to such extortion.  If we give in now, we will only encourage such acts in the future.  First our microwaves, then our filtered water dispenser, then our refrigerators will become targets of these evil doers.  Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!

Hey Everybody,

Place the contents of your wallet on a photocopy machine and copy both
sides of each license, credit card, etc. You will know what you had in
your wallet and all of the account numbers and phone numbers to call and
cancel in case it gets lost or worse yet, stolen. Keep the photocopy in
a safe place.

I pass this along, for your information, in case you hadn't thought of
it. We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed us in
your name, address, SS#, credit, etc. Unfortunately (the author of this
piece who happens to be an attorney) had firsthand knowledge, because
my wallet was stolen last month and within a week the thieve(s) ordered
an expensive monthly cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit card,
had a credit line approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN
number from DMV to change my driving record information online, and
more.

But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this
happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel
your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free
numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those

where you can find the easily. File a police report immediately in the
jurisdiction where it was stolen, this proves to credit providers you
were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation (if there
ever is one).

But here's what is perhaps most important:  (I never ever thought to do
this).  Call the three national credit reporting organizations
immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and SS#.  I had never
heard of doing that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an
application for credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert
means any company that checks your credit knows your information was
stolen and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit. By

the time I was advised to do this almost 2 weeks after the theft, all
the damage had been done. There are records of all the credit checks
initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about before
placing the alert. Since then, no additional damage has been done, and
the thieves threw my wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). It
seems to have stopped them in their tracks.

The numbers are:
Equifax: 1-800-525-6285
Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742
Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289
Social Security Administration (fraud line): 1-800-269-0271

Do think about passing this information along. It could really help
someone.

"FW: Red Rock Files","fyi - Order conditioned noise surveys only on Stations 3 and 4.     - kelly  

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Martens, Donna  
Sent:	Monday, January 14, 2002 4:18 PM
To:	Allen, Kelly; Veatch, Stephen
Cc:	Petersen, Keith; Lindberg, Lorraine; Eisenstein, Arnold L.; Campbell, Larry; Chanley, Earl
Subject:	Red Rock Files

Hi Kelly!  You should be receiving two boxes in the morning containing the Red Rock files.  I have included a listing of what is included in each box.  Any questions, please feel free to call me at 7138 here in Omaha.  

As we discussed on the phone, this was a pretty clean order with the following notifications/conditions remaining:
notice of end of construction & in-service date
notice of actual costs
notice of abandonment of original units (Note: We received approval to maintain the ability to operate the existing units up to 6 months after the installation of the new units to insure continuity of service.  The new units and existing units can NOT run simultaneously).
noise surveys at Stations 3 (and 4 if applicable)  (The base noise surveys for Sta 3 & 4 indicated noise levels right at or close to 55 Ldn.   FERC therefore conditioned us with conducting noise surveys on these two stations to ensure the final noise level was within the 55 Ldn limit.  The surveys for Sta 1 & 2 indicated a noise level below 55 Ldn; FERC, therefore, did not condition us.  Larry is still conducting surveys on all stations to ensure levels are within 55 Ldn).
as with all construction projects, any change in the construction or mitigation measures must be requested and director's letter received.

NOTE:  There is a cultural resource site at Station 1 that is suppose to be fenced-in DURING CONSTRUCTION per SHPO and FERC.  As of our conference call on Thursday, this area had not been fenced in yet.   The fencing needs to be permanent and maintained during the ongoing operation of the station.

Also, as we discussed, on November 26, 2001 (I believe that is the correct date) we filed a request for an extension of time to replace the units at Station 4.  We have not heard anything from FERC.  In fact, altho it is included in the Daily Listing of FERC's website, it has not been scanned in on the individual docket site.   Discussions Keith had with Lon Stanton, it was decided to not contact FERC.   

Also, as we also discussed, they are currently planning on overhauling the units at Station 4 during March, April and May 2002.  These units were due for an overhaul, but were postponed as a result of the Red Rock filing.  Since it is unlikely that the units will be replaced at this time, the existing units need to be overhauled to ensure the integrity and continuation of service for Transwestern's system.  The overhauls are NOT A PART OF THE RED ROCK PROJECT.  

Good Luck!!!

THE GREAT WALL --An American Dream !!!!!...

 Three guys, a Canadian, Osama bin Ladin and
 Uncle Sam are out walking together one day.
 They come across a lantern and a Genie pops out
 of it.

""I will give each of you each one wish, that's three
 wishes total,"" says the Genie.
 
 The Canadian says, ""I am a farmer, my dad was a
 farmer, and my son will also farm. I want the land to
 be forever fertile in Canada.""
 
With a blink of the Genie's eye, 'POOF' the land in Canada was
forever made fertile for farming.
 
 
 Osama bin Ladin was amazed, so he said, ""I want a wall around
 Afghanistan, so that no infidels, Jews or Americans can come into
our precious state.""
 
 Again, with a blink of the Genie's eye, 'POOF' there was a huge
 wall around Afghanistan.
 
 
 ""Uncle Sam"" (A former civil engineer), asks,
 ""I'm very curious. Please tell me more about this wall.""
  The Genie explains, ""Well, it's about 15,000 feet high,
  500 feet thick and completely surrounds the country;
  nothing can get in or out---virtually impenetrable.""
 
 ""Uncle Sam"" says, ""Fill it with water.""

All, 

Please review the attached interconnect agreement between Transwestern and Questar.  It is fully reimbursable by Questar.  This interconnect will be a delivery point to Questar in the Blanco Hub.  FYI, the section of pipe that we are connecting the interconnect to is owned by Transwestern and is not part of the jointly owned facilities of the Blanco Hub.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me to discuss.

Please reply back to me with any comments you may have.  I would like to send a draft to Questar on Tuesday morning, January 22, when we return from our holiday. 

Bill and Robert - please see the red-lined language addressing the tax reimbursement.  

Thanks for your time,

Kim.   X33098

"Deferred Compensation","A number of you have had a lot of concern about Deferred Compensation that Enron has ceased to pay as a result of the bankruptcy.  Maybe we have some good news -- there is a ""rumor"" out today, in the event you have not heard, from a reliable source, that the Deferred Compensation creditors have moved up from 4th place to a little higher because of the amount of money involved.  I have heard that Mike Moran has been placed on the ""Creditors Committee.""  I believe that Mike Moran and Dan Ryser were working together.  Part of the rumor indicates that the largest creditors -- primarily the banks -- may buy out the Deferred Compensation creditors ""to avoid having to deal with them.""  That is about all that I have heard at this time, except that the ""buyout"" may not be 100%.

Section 13A doesn't address how the imbalance on an OFO day is treated but 13.A.5 that states that after Pack/Draft, Alert Day, MSS... are calculated the rest of the imbalance is cumulated into the operator account for the monthly total(should I assume the OFO balance is included in the monthly total?).

In an underage or overage OFO the customer is charged the $10 for the under or over burned amount. Assuming that the customer was in penalty he has to pay $10/dth, but does the imbalance on the OFO day become part of the cumulative monthly balance that the customer can book/cashout?

Teb, is this correct?

Galen, can you have Larry Hill go behind the scene and to see how it was programmed (I know it's a busy day for invoicing but sometime this week?).

Rachel,

To recap one question/answer:

In an OFO situation, the customer faces a $10/Dth penalty.  What happens to
the volume imbalance?  Is it immediately cashed-out as with the Overage
Alert Day, or does it hit the monthly imbalance for cash-out/book-out?

Do I have it right by saying that in an Alert Day situation, the volume is
immediately cashed-out daily?

When you get a minute, please advise.  Thank you!

David

Subject:	San Juan Expansion Options - Small Volume

Marketing requested Planning to review any and all possibilities to achieve small volume expansions through the San Juan lateral.  Several facility scenarios were investigated by Planning which are in the attached Excel spreadsheet.  Most if not all are too costly to justify installing.  However, there is another option that is not listed in the attached that was a late entry.  Discussions with Engineering have determined that by cooling the inlet air to the turbines would increase the available horsepower.  That in turn would increase the station's overall throughput.  Preliminary studies indicate that approximately 10 MMcf/d of additional throughput could be realized if inlet air cooling is installed.  The + 30% estimate for two units would be $600,000.  BIG bargain compared to the options in the attached file.  The facility installation is not a major job but the FERC approval to utilize additional horsepower could take 6 - 9 months.  Other considerations to review would be the air quality permit for the increase in horsepower, and potential environmental clearances to do construction.  Let me know what you think about this suggestion.  Please feel free to call.

The imbalance becomes part of thecumulative imbalance subject to book-out/cash-out.

Subject:	RE: San Juan Expansion Options - Small Volume

Guys from the environmental side, this looks like a no brainer, if all we are goning to do is add a cooler and no horsepower.  Because this will be an increase in capacity it will probably be a 7C project by FERC and require an environmental report to be prepared.  The only glitch I see is the noise survey and possibly some abatement or modifications to the cooler to reduce the post construction noise levels. It would also be helpful to know which facility we are talking about.......

Don't know if you have seen this.....but it looks like it is a hot one.  Depending on how the FERC filing was left and how the air permits are currently configured, this may not need any approvals.  Earl, are you in the lead on this or is Power Systems like on Station 1??

You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Phyllis: Did this station get set up yesterday? It did not come across in PLE yet. I guess it should have a start date of 12/30/01, since that is when it started to flow .

Would you please work with Jeff to get this set up?

"*EMCA* An additional Restaurant Review..... Cole's on Waugh","To add to the next Newsletter:

Julie,

My partner and I have not been very visable at any of the local meetings,  
however we ALWAYS anxiously await the next installment of the newsletter.  We 
have been extremely busy making the house we bought  on Bomar liveable,  it 
was barely that way when we bought it.

We wanted to add to your restaurant review.

Cole's on Waugh is a fairly decent restaurant with an OK menu.   The Garlic 
soup was a definite hit,  and the atmosphere was great.  The wine list is 
good and the prices were very reasonable.
The entrees need a bit of work,  the beef was very ""Gamey"", the chicken 
dishes were dry,  and the fried shrimp were a bit greasy.   

All things aside we have eaten there three times,  and deem it worth while.  
We have seen the menu and service improve with each visit.  Our hope is that 
if enough people visit Cole's the menu will improve.  It is in a very 
convenient location and the owners and staff are very friendly.

Thanks
Joe Barnes

"Weekly Report of 2/1/02","California:

Legislative - In an unprecedented bipartisan effort the Senate and Assembly both approved a bill making $2.2 billion in cuts in the current fiscal year state budget.  Additionally, these cuts, primarily in the areas of salaries to award teacher excellence and program expansions, will amount to $2.9 billion in cuts toward the upcoming fiscal year estimated deficit of $12 billion.

I99-07-003  SoCalGas Unbundling.  The Southern California Generation Coalition, The Utility Reform Network and the Department of General Services have filed a request for rehearing of the CPUC's decision to adopt the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement to unbundle the SoCalGas system.  No new issues were raised as the rehearing request reiterates their support for the Interim Settlement which didn't go as far to unbundle the system.

A01-09-024  SoCalGas BCAP.  The ALJ has issued the procedural schedule.  SoCal will file its revised application and testimony to reflect the impact of unbundling by March 4th.  Interested parties will file testimony on July 12th and Evidentary Hearings will begin August 27, 2002.

The price on a new Compaq M700 1ghz laptop with 284mb memory and case is approx $1800
For a Docking Station its about $200 more

Thanks, Karon

Subject:	Price Quote for New Laptop

The FGT/TW rates and certificates department no longer has a way of dialing in remotely because of outdated equipment.  Robert Barker tells me that the standard minimum on laptops that would enable us to do so is a 266 MHz processor with at least 128 megs of RAM.  Could you please provide an estimate of the costs involved to purchase such a laptop?  In addition, how long does it generally take to receive the equipment once it is ordered?

Also, I have an IBM ThinkPad that can be returned if you will let me know who handles surplus equipment.

Thank you for your assistance.

"CA rept requirements rehearing denied","Though the electronic copy is not yet available, we have faxed out a hard copy of FERC's ""Order on Rehearing"" issued today in RM01-9, ""Reporting of Natural Gas Sales to the California Market.""  All requests for rehearing and clarification have been denied, as the requirement ""is in the public interest...[and further] is necessary for the Commission to advise Congress as to whether it should change the existing regulatory framework...""

Some major points are:

(1)    Arguments that FERC cannot require the info. from non-jurisdictional entities is disputed by citation to the NGA and FPA, allowing FERC to collect any information in order to advise Congress on a matter of urgent concern.  The Commission also cites the FPA's authorization to investigate electricity issues, including the cost of generation (of which natural gas is a key factor).

(2) In response to Enron's arguments, the order states the following:
	Enron argues that the data collection should be undertaken on an as-needed basis, not regularly; FERC simply denies this.
	Enron argues that the burden of reporting was underestimated; FERC says this may be true but is no reason to rescind the requirement.
	Enron argues that the reporting is not based on the business method utilized by the company and that it does not have the information on a daily pricing and volume basis (matched to physical volumes); FERC answers that data should be submitted ""in a manner consistent with the way the particular gas seller does business.""  Examples are given in the text of the FERC order.
	If Enron is contending it should only file aggregate information, FERC finds this option unacceptable.
	Only Enron asked for an extension for the filing deadline, from 30 days to 45 days after the close of each month; FERC denies this request as unnecessary.

(3) CPUC request for access to all information filed is denied.  Sensitive price data will be exempt from public disclosure (with no exceptions) so that all parties must comply.  The order also states, ""Moreover, the purpose in seeking the information is to enable the Commission to understand the operation of the market for gas sales into California, not to investigate the conduct of particular participants in that market.""

We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread forever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad - to those who would resort to such extortion.  If we give in now, we will only encourage such acts in the future.  First our microwaves, then our filtered water dispenser, then our refrigerators will become targets of these evil doers.  Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!

Be sure to read the ""Neartown Notebook"" article on page 10 of This Week
section of today's Chronicle.

This is very important for all of us who would like to preserve both the
value and the ambiance of our blocks.  It tells about a proposal by
Neartown to enable property owners on a block-by-block basis to apply
for adherence to existing lot sizes (50 x 100 in most cases).

As it is, when a developer buys a lot in the middle of a block, he can
cut up the lot into as many as three small lots (as many as four on
corners) and build out to the property line in some cases.  This, of
course, makes it hard to sell the other houses on that block for
anything but teardowns--very bad news if you plan to make improvements
to your home or even keep it up.

There is a very important public hearing at 2:30 p.m. on October 18 at
City Hall Annex (across the street west from City Hall).  Call me if you
want a ride to the meeting or if you will take other people;  I plan to
coordinate rides to the hearing.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

In a moment of total silliness I filled out their form, printed up a picture that was on my computer from a previous web site and today found out that I have three days work, Friday, Saturday and Sunday at City Hall.  I'll be a lawyer.

"Order 637 ROFR Pricing Policy","The policy spelled out in Order No. 637 (and affirmed on rehearing in Order No. 637-A) for pricing under ROFR at the expiration of a lower-rate service agreement (where rates are ""vintaged"").  In both Order No 637 and Order No. 637-A the Commission notes that this policy is consistent with the Certificate Policy Statement issued in 1999.  Order No. 637 states as follows:

	[A] shipper exercising its ROFR could be required to match a bid up to a maximum rate higher 	than the historic maximum rate applicable to its capacity in certain limited circumstances:  when a 	pipeline expansion has been completed and an incremental rate exists on the system; the pipeline 	is fully subscribed; and there is a competing bid above the maximum pre-expansion rate applicable 	to existing shippers.

		*				*				*

	As the Commission explains in the Certificate Policy Statement, to adjust the maximum rate 	applicable to shippers exercising their ROFR in these circumstances, the pipeline would have to 	establish a mechanism for reallocating costs between the historic and incremental rates so all 	rates remain within the pipeline's cost-of-service.  The mechanism can be established either 	through a general section 4 rate case or through the filing of pro forma tariff sheets which would 	provide the Commission and the parties with an opportunity to review the proposal prior to 	implementation.


Order No. 637 references one instance where a pipeline had filed such a mechanism as follows:

	Cf. Viking Gas Transmission Company, 89 FERC Para. 61,204 (1999) (rejecting tariff filing to raise 	matching rates under a ROFR where, among other things, the filing did not readjust existing and 	expansion rates.

Jan and I are doing a search right now to determine where there have been any other filings.  I'll let you know what we find.

Let me know if you have any follow-up questions.

"FW: Read all it is really cute","


Little David comes home from first grade and tells
his father that they learned about the history of Valentine's Day.

""Since Valentine's day is for a Christian saint and we're Jewish,"" he asks,
""will God get mad at me for giving someone a valentine?""

David's father thinks a bit, then says ""No, I don't
think God would get mad. Who do you want to give a valentine to?""

""Osama Bin Laden,"" David says.

""Why Osama Bin Laden,"" his father asks in shock.

""Well,"" David says, ""I thought that if a little American Jewish boy could
have enough love to give Osama a valentine, he might start to think that
maybe we're not all bad, and maybe start loving people a little bit. And if
other kids saw what I did and sent valentines to Osama, he'd love everyone a
lot. And then he'd start going all over the place to tell everyone how much
he loved them and how he didn't hate anyone anymore.""

His father's heart swells and he looks at his boy with newfound pride.
""David, that's the most wonderful thing I've ever heard.""

""I know,"" David says, ""and once that gets him out in
the open, the Marines could blow the shit out of him.""

"Final Draft of NOPR Comments","
I've incorporated my final comments into the attached draft (not red-lined).  Below are a couple of additional notes.

Footnote 4 does not appear at the bottom of the page where the actual footnote resides; it appears on the following page.  This may clear up when all the formatting is completed or it may be something that needs to be fixed.  Also, there is a line drawn above the footnote that should not be there.

I added language under #2 on page 3.  Our rationale in the second paragraph needed a lead-in, which I added to the end of the first paragraph.

For footnote 5, I deleted the text, which was from an earlier note of mine.  I changed the footnote to reference the new paragraph number instead of a page number in the NOPR.  The quote is in paragraph 7 of the NOPR.  Please revise the footnote to use the proper verbiage.


Thanks,
Theresa

Announcing The New ETS Categories Of Risk Acceptance In eRequest!!
All deviations from the Corp/ETS IT standards will require appropriate business justification and can now be submitted from the eRequest system.  The following categories are available:
?	Group IDs
?	Local Server Admin
?	Local Workstation Admin
?	Mass Storage Devices
?	Service Accounts
?	Support Accounts
?	Test Accounts
?	Training Accounts
Procedures For Obtaining Risk Acceptance Are Documented Below:
1.	Connect to eRequest at <http://itcapps.corp.enron.com/srrs/entry/srrs.asp>.
2.	If you have a Corp id, click on the CORP LOGON button. If you do not have a Corp id, select the NON-CORP login. You will have to input your email id or select 	SEARCH, and select your email address from a pick list.
	Note: First time users will be prompted to set up a New Logon Profile by providing your company number, cost center, social security number, 	location, and phone number.
3.	Select the button that represents the type of request you want to make (i.e., Update Account Access, New Account, etc.).
4.	Confirm who the request is for; you may have to do a SEARCH to find your id. Click OK upon confirmation.
5.	Click on the Applications icon.
	It is very important that you select ETS for your Region. If you do not, your request may incorrectly route to Corp and will be denied.
	(Hint:  To set your default region to ETS, click on the My Info button.  At this screen, Houston users should select ETS-Houston, Omaha users should select ETS-	Omaha, etc.)
6.	With the Applications box blank, click SHOW ALL or enter Risk Acceptance in the Applications box and click SEARCH.
7.	All Risk Acceptance categories are expanded under Risk Acceptance in the Applications list.  (Many of the categories have been defined to enable approval from 	Houston, Omaha, and Field offices.)  Select the category you desire and submit the request.

There is also a spray that youjust hook up to you hose and spray your yard, bushes and under your house. It is non-toxic and works really well also.

The mosquitoes are terrible.  It is hurting me to look at Kendall (my son) any more, as the number of bites on him have gone into the double digits.
 
I cannot imagine that we are the only ones suffering from these nasty little pests, and I want to do something about it.
 
If any of you have time tomorrow, can you do me this - can you call Harris County Mosquito Control and help me complain?  I figure that if a whole load of us start calling, they won't be able to ignore us.
 
Their number is 713-440-4800.  I get a recording when I call, but their hours are 8 - 5, so maybe we can talk to a live person tomorrow.
 
Thank you for helping me, and ultimately helping everyone.

Is the intent that this will be a negotiated rate?  If not,  do we need to add language that the discounted rate will be between max and min rates?  All else looks fine. --  Teb

"FW: RED ROCK WEEKLY REPORT - from k. allen","
Teb and Steve - my comments (from k. allen)

CP01-115 order issued 7/16,2001;  Paragraph D, under Commission Orders, states that all facilities must be in-service within one year from the issuance of a final order.  

It appears from the RR Weekly Report (1/10/02) that Stations for 1 and 2 will not be in-service until mid-June 2002, and Station 3 until July 2002. 

If Lorraine is asking whether TW can use or find existing capacity in order to flow incremental RR volume until Stations 1 and 2 are in-service, I think the answer is yes.   I didn't read anything in the order that prohibits TW  (in fact TW does mention possible in-service delays in the order).  If the TW RR schedule slides, TW should consider filing an amendment requesting additional time to complete construction.

Do we want to tell our shippers yet or wait and also do we want to try to use existing space for the Oneok deal so we do not loose out on any revenue?

"RE: Pooling points","If the pooling points are used on a firm contract, it will be as a receipt point, not as a delivery point (so it wouldn't be behind a division).  The only time it would be used as a delivery point, would be on a western division firm contract - and at this time, the western division firm do not do capacity release transactions.  nb

Subject:	RE: Pooling points
Importance:	High

We believe the reason why we received an 'Invalid Point for This Rate Schedule' validation message during the capacity release award process was due to the fact that pool point (POI 25309/DRN 716) is a Western Division point trying to added as a primary point on an FTS-2 contract.  The validation did not occur when the contract was created because this point was designated as a valid associated point behind a division.  

Can a western division point be set up as an associated point behind a market division?  If so, can the releasing shipper be allowed to release the associated point, which will then become the acquiring shipper's primary point on an FTS-2 contract?

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Subject:	Pooling points
Importance:	High

Linda, Elizabeth posed a question to me asking if a firm contract can have pooling points with firm capacity.  My first inclination was that firm customers do not have pooling points with firm capacity on their firm contracts, but this is not to say that they cannot request to move to a pooling point and release from that point (I verified with Teb Lokey).  In our current contract system, there is not a validation stopping the user from inputting a pool point as a firm point on a contract, however, according to Elizabeth, she did get an error message when initiating a capacity release transaction from a pooling point (for testing).  So, what I think needs to happen, is that we allow pooling points to have firm capacity on both the contract and capacity release systems.  I do not believe this to be a high priority with implementation, but should however, be put in place with TW's implementation.  nb

"Re: *EMCA* Neglected vacant lots & bums","
Do you wanna know what the cops said one time when we called them to report
people who had broken into a (nice) empty home, and who were living there,
while also stealing all the personal belongings left by the former
residents, in addition to ripping off the fireplace mantle and any other
saleable items?
After refusing to go inside the building to get the bums, the cop said,
""Homeless people need a place to sleep, too.""   !!!

"CPUC Infrastructure Report","As reported in Gas Daily today, the CPUC has issued a report assessing the state's gas infrastructure of the three major utilities in California.  Their conclusion is that the natural gas transportation and storage systems are adequate to provide seasonally reliable amounts of competitively priced natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation customers.  Therefore they recommend that the Power Authority should not finance any new natural gas projects.  Other conclusions: conservation will reduce demand on the infrastructure, improved coordination between electric and gas operations can enhance reliability, and the CPUC should continue to evaluate the need for gas infrastructure expansions.  Below is the link if you would like to review the entire report.  gh

"Re: *EMCA* Mosquitoes","thanks to everyone.  Ultimately, Nathalie's suggestion appears to be the
most effective and the most desirable, as there are no harmful chemicals
emitted from the contraption.

If anyone else is interested in the Mosquito Magnet, there are two websites
that I found:

www.mosquitomagnet.com
and
www.skeeter-beater.com

also, A-B Gas, on West 18th (713-682-5555) sells them - he can have you one
in 3-4 days.

        Considering Teb's comments relative to support activity for more than the Red Rock project then the OH order 
        may be the best option for now.  All should keep in mind that some new accounting rules may require these costs 
        to be expensed and only allow for costs directly related to a project be capitalized.

Jim - We've decided to settle for the less than ideal solution and charge the TW OH workorder instead of specific projects.

Subject:        RE: TW Overhead WO 

We can charge directly but still need some guidance.  For example, it is my understanding that there are 4 WO set up for Red Rock - one for each station to be modified.  Our work is of a general nature, so do we have to further subdivide our charges to each of the stations, or to three of the stations.  Also, some of our time is spent on a general analysis of regulatory strategy involving all capital projects, and it seems like the overhead WO would be appropriate for these charges.  We don't necessarily want to have to have each person charge to 3 or 4 WO for each identifiable capital project and then to 10 or more WO for our general work.

Subject:	RE: TW Overhead WO

We can charge directly but still need some guidance.  For example, it is my understanding that there are 4 WO set up for Red Rock - one for each station to be modified.  Our work is of a general nature, so do we have to further subdivide our charges to each of the stations, or to three of the stations.  Also, some of our time is spent on a general analysis of regulatory strategy involving all capital projects, and it seems like the overhead WO would be appropriate for these charges.  We don't necessarily want to have to have each person charge to 3 or 4 WO for each identifiable capital project and then to 10 or more WO for our general work.  Any specific suggestions, WO numbers, etc. ?

"Benefits/Intercompany Reports","I attended (via phone) the GL User Group meeting this afternoon.  Ron Nightingale reported that he is in the process of preparing a Statement of Work for the benefits and intercompany reports that will set forth the alternatives for the development of each of these reports.  The preferred option is to contract with the developer that was working on the benefits report previously.  Estimates for the completion of both reports total $50,000.  As it stands now, the $50,000 would come out of Mike Sullivan's 2002 budget of $100,000.  For obvious reasons, there is some reluctance to move forward at this price.  I mentioned to Ron in a previous conversation that the cost of developing the reports could perhaps be deferred in our respective rate case work orders.  I did not want to bring this up again without mentioning it to each of you.  I need your input and intervention at this point.
 
FYI  - I also learned that the new shared services company, Co. 179E, will contain Enron employees that will perform services on behalf of all the pipelines.  This company is being designated as a division of Co. 366.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Print and read.  Whereas, it is not sensational like mainstream news, it

Sorry, alarmists and politicians.  The laws of economics are nearly as sure

Where Did the Energy Crisis Go?

by Jerry Taylor and Peter VanDoren

     Jerry Taylor is director of natural-resources studies at the Cato Institute. Peter VanDoren is editor
     of Cato's Regulation.

What a difference a few months make. Last spring, President Bush and politicians far and wide warned that a long,
dark, energy night would descend across America unless we adopt some sort of comprehensive national energy
""plan."" While the policy prescriptions offered by Democrats and Republicans of course differed, both liberals and
conservatives were convinced that markets were broken and only a muscular intervention by the federal government
could get us out of ""Carterville."" But alas, the energy crisis that loomed so large only a few months ago disappeared
this summer like a shimmering mirage on the horizon of a political desert.

As some of you may have noticed, energy prices dropped a whopping 5.6 percent in July, the steepest decline since
April 1986. Gasoline prices dropped an even more stunning 11 percent. Energy gluts and declining profit margins are
causing investors to freeze or even cancel energy infrastructure projects that looked so promising but a few months
ago.

Forgive us if we gloat, but we told you so. There is not and never was an energy ""crisis."" Supplies were not and are
not running dry. Markets were not and are not broken. Regulations have not strangled the industry.

What happened then? First, the economy slowed down. Second, political and ideological gridlock prevented
politicians and regulators from doing much harm while the markets did that supply and demand voodoo that they do so
well.

Now for the details.

On the electricity front, the western power crisis was sparked primarily by a massive increase in natural gas prices.
That increase, in turn, was triggered by a drought (which reduced the output from dams and thus increased the
demand on gas-fired generators), unseasonable weather (increasing home cooling and then home heating demand),
historically low levels of natural gas inventories (50 percent below the five-year average in February 2001), and
bottlenecks in the pipeline system that kept gas suppliers from meeting local demand.

This summer, natural-gas prices have returned almost to pre-crisis levels which have, in turn, reduced electricity prices
almost to pre-crisis levels. One reason that supplies are ample is because natural gas inventories are now higher than
usual. In fact, the scarcity last winter was somewhat due to the competition between summertime demand -- buyers
looking to stockpile natural gas to replenish inventories -- and then-and-now wintertime demand. Summertime
demand ""won.""

Another reason that natural gas supplies are robust is because North American production is up ... even without
access to additional federal lands. U.S. domestic production has increased about 4 percent over a year ago while
Canadian production is up 8 percent, which may not sound like a lot to you but those are big numbers in the energy
industry.

A secondary cause of the power crisis was the large number of gas-fired generators that were down for repairs last
winter. As much as a third of the state's generating capacity was offline at any given time during the worst of the crisis.
The maintenance backlog from last summer is now over and a large amount of generating capacity has returned to the
market.

Most newspaper stories tell us that an important reason for the spectacular electricity price drop is a spectacular drop
in demand. True: Electricity use in the areas served by the California Independent System Operator is 4.4 percent
lower through July 2001 than the first 7 months of 2000. These newspaper stories then go on to tell us that one of the
main reasons for the drop in demand has been unseasonably cool weather. False: If you examine the number of
""cooling degree days"" in California (the difference between the average daily temperature and 65 degrees) and weight
those figures by population, you'll find that temperatures through July 2001 where most Californians live are actually
14 percent warmer than last year.

The drop in electricity demand is actually something of a mystery. Some of it is almost certainly due to the retail
electricity price increases imposed in California this summer, but some of it is also probably due to the crisis mentality
that has gripped the state. Once Californians accepted that the scarcity was real and that it could get even worse,
conservation kicked in beyond what prices alone might have delivered. And some of it can be attributed to the slowing
economy and the slumping dot.com sector in particular. No one knows, however, exactly how much each of these
events contributed to the drop in demand.

The gasoline story is, however, a lot simpler. The widespread warnings of $3 a gallon gasoline were about what might
happen if a key refinery or two blew up or if a key pipeline or two ruptured unexpectedly. Such things are indeed
possible (in fact, a fire on August 14 at a Citgo refinery in Lemont, Illinois has increased Midwestern gasoline prices
by 26 cents per gallon in the last two weeks), but they don't happen all the time. And they didn't happen in large part
this summer. Unfortunately, most people missed the qualifications in the midst of the panic and braced themselves for a
storm that was never sited in the first place.

When gasoline prices went up this spring, people bought less gasoline. And while it's true that no new refinery has
been built in the United States in about 30 years, there's still room to increase production from existing refineries when
profit opportunities present themselves ... as they did (for a change) this summer. Moreover, foreign refineries for the
first time in memory found it profitable to produce significant amounts of America gasoline for export. And what do
you know; prices have been dropping steadily since Memorial Day.

The moral of the story is that markets aren't ""broke"" when prices spike. They're working fine; they're just not
delivering news that consumers or politicians are wild about hearing. But no matter how unpleasant price spikes are in
the short term, they're absolutely necessary to remedy the underlying economic problems. For those of you who either
forgot your introductory economics or have simply spent too much time reading the op-ed pages (a practice which can
dull the mind), here's how it generally works. On the supply side, high prices -- > high profits -- > increased
investment -- > increased supply -- > declining prices. On the demand side, high prices -- > reduced demand -- >
declining prices.

While it's no surprise that liberals find such market success stories a constant revelation, the real surprise is that the
ostensibly ""hard-right"" Bush administration had such little faith in a free-market system it's constantly praising. When
the President's chief economics advisor, Larry Lindsey, was asked by the Washington Post a day after the
administration's energy plan was released whether Cato was right to argue that markets alone could and would
alleviate energy shortages without any additional federal intervention, Mr. Lindsey said ""I don't think so.""

Well, think again Mr. Lindsey. Price hikes may come and go, but the invisible hand never takes a vacation.

  ENE:SB-Aggr;MARKET FOCUSED ON LIQUIDITY CRUNCH AND UNKNOWN 

   Cash Flow Liquidity Crisis: We believe this market is assuming the most 
  grim valuation for these off-balance sheet partnerships and other 
investments 
  . . . that they have no residual value. In addition, Enron cannot issue 
debt 
  to fund the short-term cash flow need (as the company needs its investment 
  grade debt rating for its Wholesale segment). Management has discussed 
  various asset sales that should benefit the cash flow situation ($600 
million 
  in the 4Q01 and Portland General in late 2002), but the market is 
unwilling 
  to believe these asset sales will be timely. Shareholders have paniced as 
  75.8 million shares were traded yesterday, but we believe even with dire 
  assumptions the stock can rebound from current levels once the liquidity 
  situation clears up. 
  
   Diversified Energy Group Drawn In: The market now is taking it out on 
  other diversified energy stocks as they declined significantly yesterday. 
We 
  believe investors are worried about two factors that may impact the group: 
1) 
  if these companies extensively using the off-balance sheet structure and; 
2) 
  if the natural gas/power merchant business will be negatively impacted by 
the 
  'wounded' Enron, which is the largest merchant player in North America. If 
  this continues to impact the group, there could be an excellent buying 
  opportunity at some point. 
  
   Long-Term Valuation: We have included a net asset valuation on Enron 
  making several dire assumptions. 
  <ol>1) Enron will be impacted to the full extent of the off-balance sheet 
  partnerships-our assumption is $3.6 billion; 
  2) The company writes down their investment in broadband (our 
estimate-$700 
  million) and their entire net investment in the Dabhol Power Plant in 
India 
  (our estimate-$800 million); 
  3) Valuing the three major business with the corresponding EBIT multiple: 
  Pipeline-8x, Wholesale-12x, and Retail Energy Services-12x. We derive the 
  EBIT multiple on Wholesale (and Retail) using Dynegy's (NYSE: DYN; $37; 
SB- 
  Avg) current EBIT multiple on our expected 2002 EBIT (which includes the 
  $5/share drop from yesterday). Although these EBIT multiple seem to 
  consistent with the current market trends, they are well below historical 
  norms for the group. 
  </ol>We have looked at the asset valuation in two ways. First, we have 
  assumed no asset sales and used equity funding as a 'plug' figure, which 
  dilutes shares outstanding by 24%. Our 'worst case scenario without asset 
  sales' comes up with a net asset valuation of $27.92 per share (including 
  additional shares issued at $15 per share). Our second valuation assumes 
  asset sales of $2.5 billion, assumed debt reduction of $1 billion from the 
  Portland General sale, and no equity financing. With those assumptions we 
  derived a valuation of $35.05 per share. 
  
  Of course, our net asset valuation is based on a long-term view and does 
  not take into consideration the short-term liquidity crunch ongoing at the 
  company. In addition, we are making a fairly bold assumption in that all 
  these partnerships and investments no longer have any residual value. 
  
   Debt Rating Most Important: Enron management will have to fend off any 
  debt rating downgrades below investment grade, so debt cannot make up the 
  cash flow shortfall. The company, in our opinion, will use assets sale 
and, 
  if necessary, equity funding to match up cash flows in the short term. 
  Unfortunately, the timing of assets sales can be lumpy, so equity funding 
is 
  not out of the question. 
  
   Panic Mode Abound:  With the rapid decline of the shares on large 
  volume, we believe investors are panicking and the shares are oversold at 
  7.3x our 2002 earnings expectations. Although the upcoming 10-Q and 4Q01 
  probably will not paint a good picture, we believe the company is in 
better 
  shape than a $15 per-share stock price suggests. With further disclosures 
on 
  operating segments and on the off-balance sheet partnerships, we believe 
  during the next few quarters we could see ENE come back into our $27-$35 
  valuation. 

Stock Opinion 

  We believe that investors with a time frame of 12-18 months should now 
look 
  at Enron shares due to our assessment of the company's attractive 
valuation. 
  There are obviously major concerns regarding Enron's cash flow liquidity 
in 
  the coming quarters, but we believe management should be able to time the 
  sale of assets (and equity financing, if necessary) to bring the balance 
  sheet back into order. Most importantly, the company must keep its 
investment 
  grade rating to keep its Wholesale operations running smoothly. 
  
  We believe the core businesses should allow earnings growth of 18% 
annually 
  (three-year projection). We are not suggesting that Enron is out of the 
woods 
  yet as investors should pay attention to several short-term events. First, 
  the filing of the third-quarter 10-Q should enlighten the Street on the 
  equity reduction and the cash position of the company. We also look for 
the 
  SEC to come down hard on these partnerships. We anticipate further 
  disclosures on these partnership going forward. In addition, we anticipate 
  that the company may still have another write-down and/or further 
reductions 
  of equity in the coming quarters. 
  
  Our net asset valuation notwithstanding, we keeping our $76 price target 
  using a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis of the wholesale energy 
segments 
  and EES segment. In the more-established energy segments, we used a 
multiple 
  valuation of 10x EBIT. We have changed our risk rating on Enron 
Corporation 
  from Average to Aggressive to reflect our assessment of risks associated 
with 
  the issues discussed in this note. We rate ENE shares Strong 
Buy-Aggressive. 

  Company Description 

  Enron Corporation is the leading integrated natural gas and power company. 
  The company is headquartered in Houston, Texas, with a Web site address of 
  www.enron.com.

Another tidbit to remind us that we see/hear Divinity all around us: 

Just remember, ""Our God is an Awesome God!"" 

READ This All the Way, and send it back please! 
This will give you the chills.....GOOD Chills! 

A young man had been to Wed. night Bible Study. The pastor had shared
about listening to God and obeying the Lord's voice. The young man
couldn't help but wonder, Does God still speak to people?"" 

After service, he went out with some friends for coffee 
and pie, and they discussed the message. Several different ones talked
about how God had led them in different ways.

It was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home.
Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, ""God...If you still speak to
people speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey."" 

As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest
thought to stop and buy a gallon of milk. He shook his head and said out
loud, ""God is that you?""  He didn't get a reply and started on toward
home. 

But again, the thought, buy a gallon of milk. The young man thought
about Samuel and how he didn't recognize the voice of God, and how
little Samuel ran to Eli. ""Okay, God, in case that is you, I will buy
the milk."" It didn't seem like too hard a test of obedience. He could
always use the milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of milk and
started off toward home. 

As he passed Seventh Street, he again felt the urge, ""Turn down that
street."" This is crazy he thought and drove on past the intersection.
Again, he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street. At the next
intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he
said out loud, ""Okay, God, I will."" 

He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop.
He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in a
semi-commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst
of neighborhoods either. The businesses were closed and most of the
houses looked dark like the people were already in bed.

Again, he sensed something, ""Go and give the milk to the people in the
house across the street."" The young man looked at the house. It was dark
and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already
asleep. He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat.
""Lord, this is insane. Those people are asleep and, if I wake them up,
they are going to be mad and I will look stupid."" 

Again, he felt like he should go and give the milk. Finally, he opened
the door.   ""Okay God, if this is you, I will go to the door and I will
give them the milk. If you want me to look like a crazy person, okay. I
want to be obedient. I guess that will count for something, but, if they
don't answer right away, I am out of here. 

He walked across the street and rang the bell. He could hear some noise
inside. A man's voice yelled out, ""Who is it? What do you want?""   Then
the door opened before the young man could get away.    The man was
standing there in his jeans and t-shirt.  He looked like he just got out
of bed. He had a strange look on his face, and he didn't seem too happy
to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. ""What is it?"" The young
man thrust out the gallon of milk. ""Here I brought this to you."" 

The man took the milk and rushed down a hallway, speaking loudly in
Spanish. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the milk toward
the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was
crying. The man had tears streaming down his face. The man began
speaking and half-crying, ""We were just praying. We had some big bills
this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any milk for our
baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some
milk."" 

His wife in the kitchen yelled out, ""I ask him to send an Angel with
some. Are you an Angel?""

The young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he
had on him and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward
his car and the tears were streaming down his face.   He knew that God
still answers prayers. 

This is a simple test... 

If you believe that God is alive and well, send this to at least ten
people and the person that sent it to you!

"Transcripts of Steve Cooper's voicemails","
On January 29, 2002, Enron named Stephen F. Cooper interim CEO and chief restructuring officer. To keep employees informed about developments, Mr. Cooper left voicemail messages to employees on January 29 and February 8.   Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcripts of those messages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

STEPHEN F. COOPER VOICEMAIL
Friday, February 8, 2002

Hi everybody.  This is Steve Cooper.  It's about 1:00 or 2:00 o'clock Houston time, Friday afternoon.  It's been a pretty hectic week, but I'd like to take just a moment to bring everybody up to date so that everybody is fully in the loop with what's gone on this last week.

Beginning last weekend, the Board's special investigative committee released a fairly lengthy report - in fact it's about 200 odd pages, and it's fairly pointed and blunt.  The report was troubling, and as I'm sure any number of you has seen from the various investigatory committees this week, its findings have further dented our corporate history.  Nonetheless, I just wanted to let you know that my role and the job I'm paid to do, and hopefully, the job all of you are getting paid to do, is to look forward and proceed that way at 100 percent full speed.  I continue to believe we really have a lot to look forward to.

The committee and the report didn't offer any specific recommendations.  Rather, it just compiled what they believed to be a series of facts about transactions that have been undertaken over the last several years.  Enron's board, management and Creditors' Committee are now working together to evaluate the reports' findings and take whatever action is required.  I, like many of you, am looking forward to management changes that result from these actions because to successfully to restructure the company, we're going to have to have a management team in place that is credible, that's committed to moving forward for the future, that is trusted by our outside constituents, and are firmly committed to make a new Enron work.  Next week, after the Board meeting, I hope to be able to share with you the management changes that are being contemplated and outline a team that Jeffrey and myself are compiling to rebuild the company.

The Washington hearings this week heated up considerably and made for some either very dull or very expected or pretty interesting television viewing.  And obviously, this has been translated into the daily headlines.  Hopefully, these investigatory processes will continue to help uncover and address any past misconduct or negligence surrounding Enron.  And with this, I'm sure we'll be able to establish appropriate safeguards for employees and shareholders going forward - not only for Enron - but for other corporations.  This situation, I believe, will have a national impact.

It's going to force the big five accounting firms to change the way they do business - in fact it already has.
It's going to bring in new and more effective reporting rules.
It's going to put more teeth into the SEC,.
ARISA is going to be modified.
There's not a doubt in my mind that Congress or these Committees are eventually going to look at Wall Street and the commercial banks and put them in their sites.

During the last week I've spent almost all my time dealing with the company's Creditors' Committee and chatting with individual members of the committee to understand their current thinking, concerns and issues so we can begin to construct with them an absolutely open agenda, a free flow of information, a free flow of communications, and begin to work with them to develop a plan to reorganize Enron.  As I continue to look at our various businesses, I'm as optimistic as I was a week ago that there is a reorganizable platform here that ought to allow us, if everybody is reasonable and responsible, and we can begin to put some of our emotions aside to create a viable strong company that ought to be able to be successfully reorganized.

In any event, I'll continue to keep you updated as we move forward.  In the meantime, if you have any specific questions or comments about Enron or its restructuring or anything else that's on your mind, don't hesitate to either send me an e-mail or give me a buzz and I will do the best I can to respond as quickly as possible.  If my response isn't satisfactory the first time around - just buzz me again.

Listen everyone, have a wonderful weekend and I hope to see you next week in Houston.  Bye-bye.

STEPHEN F. COOPER VOICEMAIL
Tuesday, January 29, 2002

Good morning everyone, this is Steve Cooper ? it's the morning of January 29th and I wanted to take an opportunity to introduce myself and tell you how pleased I am to have been selected as Enron's interim CEO.  My firm, Zolfo Cooper, my partners and I have assisted hundreds of companies as they have worked their way through the restructuring and reorganization process.  I just wanted to give you some of my thoughts about it as we move forward.

I can't imagine what the past few months have been like for all of you.  I'm sure it's been incredibly difficult, particularly with the glare of the media attention and the numerous investigations and inquiries that have been launched and continue to be launched.  In that environment, I've got to believe it's difficult, if not impossible, for you to focus on what lies ahead for Enron and for the organization.

I'm not going to bother to restate what is in the press release announcing my selection and our new management team this morning, however, I'd like to tell you how we typically approach situations like this.

It's been the experience of myself, my firm, my partners, that in helping companies emerge from bankruptcy, we look at a number of key metrics to gauge the potential for successful restructurings.  Those metrics are typically the organization, the asset base that the company has to bring to bear, customer base, and liquidity.  From what I've been able to tell over the last couple of days and with my exposure to the management team here, Enron has a very, very bright, very capable, very committed, hardworking and dedicated organization.  All of the people I have met are committed to reorganize, restructure and bring Enron to a successful new beginning and emerge from bankruptcy.

Number 2, the physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here.  The regulated assets, the pipelines, the generating plants provide steady and reliable cash flow and provide a very sound fundamental base to restructure around.

Third, loyal customers.  Most of Enron's customers have continued to stand by the company and continue to take delivery of natural gas and electricity on a daily basis.

And fourth, liquidity looks good with the cash the company has on hand, the cash it expects to generate in the near term, and with the backstop of the DIP financing, it doesn't appear that we will have any liquidity issues going forward.

With those four resources nicely in place, I'm very confident that we can successfully restructure this company.  I don't want to leave the impression that it will be easy.  It's going to be an enormous amount of work.  There will be upsets, issues, and concerns along the way.  But I can tell you that I've seen companies in bankruptcy that don't have nearly as strong a position as this company.  They were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy, and I'm certain Enron will also.

I'm looking forward to working with all of you over the next few months and I'm very pleased to be here.  Jeff, Ray and I will keep you informed on a regular basis as we move forward.  If there are any thoughts, concerns, issues that you would like to bring to my attention, please don't hesitate to drop me a note or give me a call.

Thanks so much, and I look forward to working with all of you.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Jan 28	
Beginning at 6:00 p.m., the Telephony team will remove the telephone switch from 3AC and migrate phone numbers.  The maintenance is expected to last approximately one hour.

Osteopornosis: A degenerate disease. (this one got extra credit)

Karmageddon: It's like, when everybody is sending off all these

it's like, a serious bummer. 
Glibido: All talk and no action. 
Dopeler Effect: The tendency of stupid ideas to seem smarter

Hi Zelda,
 
I believe we may have a candidate for this assignment.
 
Agency said candidate is flexible with pay rate.  Candidate would prefer $19.00 but would work for $18.00.  Agency has said that candidate just coming off a long term assignment where she converted a manual to disk (or vice versa) and then proofread for accuracy.
 
Pay rate $18.00/ Bill rate 30.24
Pay rate $19.00/ Bill rate 31.92
 
Please call me at your earliest convenience.
 
Thanks!

From 10:30 p.m. through 12/15 at 2:00 a.m., Enron Network Services will remove routing from the 192.168.73.x interfaces on ENA-CR1-ARD and ENA-CR2-ARD. This change will result in an intermittent disruption of service to devices on the ETS Ardmore networks.  This change will not affect devices on the 10.0.0.0 segment.  The outage is expected to last for less than two minutes.  This change is necessary to fully implement the new MAN.

"Message from Jim Saunders - Account Coding Changes for NNG","Effective 2/1/02 a new company will go into effect called ENNG.  The company code is 179E.

The primary purpose of this company is to account for the payroll of the Enron employees who are currently on company 0179, and who will remain Enron employees after the 2/1/02 transition of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy.  

With respect to coding invoices, recording time and other similar transactions on Northern Natural Gas (0179) please note the following that are effective 2/1/02:
 
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 FAR order or project, continue using the same codes.  No changes here.
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 cost center, use the same cost center number except replace the first digit with a 5.  For example, if you would have charged 111222, charge 511222 instead.  These ""5"" series cost centers have been set up on company 179E, but their payroll and expenses flow into company 0179.  You will not be able to code direct to a 0179 cost center after January business (1/31/02).  
If you are becoming a Dynegy employee on 2/1/02, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 do not enter your time into eHRonline or the SAP timekeeping application.  During the next week or two we will be working with Dynegy on an alternative for capturing and accounting for your time and payroll expenses.
If you are currently a 0179 employee and are continuing as an Enron employee, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 continue entering your time as you ordinarily would.  Unless you exception code to FAR orders or projects, your hours will automatically go into the appropriate ""5"" series cost center on company 179E.  

If you have any questions or need additional information concerning these coding changes please contact Trey Meerbott at (713) 853-7003.

"RE: SoCal Unbundling","The Draft Proposed Decision for the Comprehensive Settlement doesn't specifically address this 50MM/d.  My recollection is that this new capacity was discussed in the SoCal System Adequacy proceeding last summer however the new open access procedures should allow for designating this receipt point capacity from Transwestern.  I'll verify this as soon as they issue the final decision which may be this afternoon.  gh

Subject:	RE: SoCal Unbundling

What about the access to the 50,000/d of new capacity at Needles that was being constructed? Wasn't that part of this proceeding? SoCal had argued that it would go to TW (we needed it for Red Rock).

"Columbia Gulf order on negotiated rates","I received a copy of an order issued by the FERc on Columbia negotiated rate transaction, which includes a formula ie indexed rate.  They accepted the negotiated rate deal but they are requiring  them to file in their tariff within ONE DAY after the rate has been determined the contract and actual rate. ( Each time the actual rate changes during the term)   Just think about this for the upcoming TW_ USGT deal and NNG""- Reliant deals.    Notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing, the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day---  I believe this is FERC's way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals-  they are punishing themselves as well, as each filing will require a notice etc-  so every day they could need to issue an order.   

I feel we need to discuss with Columbia, INGAA and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare.  An alternative would be to require you to post on Internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate, so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate.  I'm sending you guys a copy of the order.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"Plan Assumptions with Stan, 2/6/02, 8:00 am","I talked with Rod about the purpose of the meeting.  Stan wants to start thinking about the assumptions for the 2004 rate case and a ten year Plan.  I will bring the 2002 Plan but it is really a short-term Plan and Rod does not want me to hand out anything.  It is a strategy session.

We assumed in the Plan a rate drop effective 1/1/05.  I would like to review the assumptions behind that with Teb and Blair to better understand how it was derived.  This will be one of the major issues for discussion.

"Capacity Lease (Backhaul) - Gulfstream","We are currently discussing several potential approaches for a ""Phase VII"" expansion project.  We have preliminary work underway on several potential scenarios, some of which might involve Gulfstream as an upstream transporter.  

As part of these discussions, Gulfstream has inquired about FGT's interest in providing a capacity lease for backhaul service (approximately 20-30 miles - they did not identify the specific market). 

My questions are:
	(1) Backhaul capacity lease with an interstate pipeline - Do you see any problems/issues?  The lease arrangement would be with Guflstream Pipeline.

	(2) If this backhaul lease capacity is used by Gulfstream to provide deliveries to an electric generator, would the FP&L Favored Nations Clause be triggered?

"*EMCA* For All of You Trying to Work on Set-Backs--","Be sure to read the ""Neartown Notebook"" article on page 10 of This Week section of today's Chronicle. 

This is very important for all of us who would like to preserve both the value and the ambiance of our blocks.  It tells about a proposal by Neartown to enable property owners on a block-by-block basis to apply for adherence to existing lot sizes (50 x 100 in most cases). 

As it is, when a developer buys a lot in the middle of a block, he can cut up the lot into as many as three small lots (as many as four on corners) and build out to the property line in some cases.  This, of course, makes it hard to sell the other houses on that block for anything but teardowns--very bad news if you plan to make improvements to your home or even keep it up. 

There is a very important public hearing at 2:30 p.m. on October 18 at City Hall Annex (across the street west from City Hall).  Call me if you want a ride to the meeting or if you will take other people;  I plan to coordinate rides to the hearing.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"FW: SoCalGas/SDG&E BCAPs -- ALJ Brown Denies EGA Motion to Strike","FYI--Greg Klatt will participate in the Meet and Confer meeting on Tuesday in regard to the procedural schedule.  gh

Subject:	SoCalGas/SDG&E BCAPs -- ALJ Brown Denies EGA Motion to Strike


ALJ Brown denied the EGA motion to strike, so testimony on both the  embedded cost-based and the long-run marginal cost-based (LRMC) methodologies  for revenue allocation among customer classes will be allowed in this  proceeding.   Attached is a copy of  her ruling.  Her primary rationale is expressed on page 6, as  follows:
"".....the Commission has frequently  deviated from cost allocations based solely on LRMC, and has been moving  towards embedded costs for unbundled transmission and storage functions, as  evidenced in both the recent decision in the GIR, and in the Gas Accord for  PG&E.  Therefore, it is  apparent that the Commission is interested in comparing LRMC and embedded cost  for cost allocation purposes.  For  this reason, EGA's motion to strike testimony on embedded cost-based  allocation is denied.  Testimony  on embedded costs will be compared with the testimony on LRMC, to enable  parties and the Commission to determine which method, or combination of  methods, is most appropriate for allocation among customers of each utilities'  non-gas costs of service.   Including an embedded cost analysis in this BCAP might require more  work from all the parties, but the record will then be as complete as possible  so that the Commission can make a well-informed  decision.""
She also ruled that, ""The  evidentiary hearing schedule of May 21 through June 14, 2002, is not suspended  at this time.  No later than January  22, 2002, parties are to meet and confer to determine if a shift in the filing  dates for testimony will be sufficient to meet the needs of the parties' to  respond to the March amendments to Biennial Cost Allocation Proceeding  applications, and keep the established hearing schedule.""

"Phase V Tie In","Transaction Support Accounting met with Jack Boatman and Rachel Cady yesterday to discuss their notification below
as related to a tie-in for the Phase V project.:

	""On March 1st and 2nd our Phase V crew will be working the 24"" and 36"" mainline to tie-in the Gulf South Mobile Bay interconnect.  This work will require that Transco Citronelle to be partially shut-in on March 1st and completely shut-in on the 2nd. In order to maintain delivery pressures in the Market Area  during this work we will have to borrow(defer exchange) gas up to 220,000/day from Bay Gas Storage at an estimated cost of about $80,000 to $100,000.

This cost to complete the tie-in is quite unique since we are only paying to borrow the gas and we wanted to notify you about this cost so you can start thinking about how to include it in the work order for the Phase V tie-in.""

Meeting Conclusion:
	The ""borrowed gas"" if used will be a part of the OBA at the interconnect and will be repaid within the month. - No Gas Acctg. 	Issues or follow-up items.  Jack indicated they previously discussed with Rate Dept.

	The $80,000-$100,000 cost estimate is the fee to be paid to Bay Gas to be ready to perform during the const. period.
		To Do's:
		John Cobb to review construction costs treatment for this fee with Jim Saunders.
		(Subject to Jim's approval this fee may be capitalized as an indirect cost of the project since it is incurred
		 due to the required construction tie-in and is only for the construction period.)
			
		Jack Boatman to contact Jim Alexander relative to this additional Phase V costs.

		Separate discussion required to discuss the purchases of linepack and purge gas.

From 6:00 - 9:00 a.m., the Envision team will re-index the databases.  This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices. 

Feb. 16
From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.  This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.  LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.

"RE: FPU","I agree with Teb.

In addition, under Section 11 (Sheet No.l22A), you get ""Section 11 rights"" (ability to shift entitlements between points) only if all of the points are under one contract.  That is not the case here.  Therefore, the Section 11 rights could not apply.  Further, the dpoa would not give Section 11 rights, as Chris seems to believe.

Now, the question arises ""If we allow FPU to combine these two contracts, can they get Section 11 rights?""  First, the two contracts would have to be under the same rate schedule (either FTS-1 or FTS-2 for SFTS).  Second, the New Smyrna Point would have to qualify as a ""division"" (as Teb points out) or as a ""plant"" (as Section 11 provides).  Third, we would have to treat all shippers the same in allowing the combining of contracts.

With regard to the third point, I understand from Jim S. that we allowed Peoples to combine a West Florida contract (acquired through a permanent release) with their existing contract, so that Section 11 rights extended to the new point(s).

I do not believe we can make a single point a division in this case.  There is a definition of division on sheet no. 102B which seems to say a point must be interconnected with other points to be a division.  I know we treat single points as divisions in certain other contracts, but I believe these were set up prior to 11/2/92 and are ""grandfathered"". I also don't believe we are obligated - or able - to extend Sec. 11 rights to new points.  Frazier, what's your reading of this?

I don't think we should give out section 11 rights here.  There were none before.
Physically, firm deliveries could be shifted out of this point, but none in.  
He can shift on an alternate basis.

Chris Snyder with FPU called and asked if the New Smyrna point, poi 16160 on contract 100740 (which is the only delivery point on that contract that they permanently acquired through capacity release) could be made a division.  The point was acquired through a permanent capacity release transaction as a single point. 

The problem is that they requested to combine this point into their current dpoa, contract 5002 that has points behind divisions.  The allocation reports he gets do not reflect this point since it is not in a division.  Can we make a point a division just so the reports can ""pick up"" the point?  Chris also mentioned that he does not want this point in a separate dpoa because he wants to be able to take advantage of the section 11 rights with their other delivery points on their dpoa.  

Frazier and Teb, please let me know if we can do this so that we can make the appropriate changes in our system.  nb

"Re: *EMCA*","Chris,

Thank you so much for your interest.  We live at 612 Peden and if you would like to, just bring them by and if we are there, put them in the back of the white truck.  If we aren't there, you can put them inside the fence.  I think they will be ok till we get there.  Ed Gonzales has offered to meet with me to talk about this project so I will report after that meeting. 

Thank again.  Josena Arquieta

    Hello everyone,

    We have started an exciting project and would like to let everyone know about it and hopefully get some help with it.  We are asking people to donate their aluminum cans and the proceeds will be used to recycle a house for Habitat For Humanity.
     
    Monday morning between 6 and 8 am on channel 26, they are airing an article about the project.  It should be an interesting article.  They have interviewed Dave Daniel's, Director of Development for Habitat, me inside the trailer where we put the cans and a woman that is receiving a house. The Houston area is throwing away enough aluminum cans to sponsor 116 houses.  We only recycle 51% of the cans sold.  It takes 95% less energy to recycle than to mine and produce new. 

    If anyone would like to talk to me about this project, please give me a call at home:  713 522-3123 or at work:  J D Metals 832 467-3199.

"Merry Christmas","Merry Christmas Teb,
I hope you are having one as good as possible. I'll see you this week-end
when we bring Alanna back up for school.

Not long ago I was telling you about rediscovering a couple of old Corpus
Bands through an internet site calle E-Music.com, that I download free
albums(as many as I want) but at the monent I couldn't remember their names.
Well I looked them back up and I'm sure you would remember them. They are
Zakary Thaks and The Bad Seeds. In fact they made a album together called
""Texas Shoot Out"" which was a sort of battle of the Corpus Christi bands.
The following are Bios of the bands from another web site called The Artist
Direct Network. This web site has almost an unbelievable amount of info on
every group, singer, song, or album in the History of All Modern Music. What
ever you want to know it will tell you.

One of the best garage bands of the '60s, and one of the best teenage rock
groups of all time, Zakary Thaks released a half-dozen regionally
distributed singles in 1966 and 1967; some were hits in their hometown of
Corpus Christi, TX, but none were heard elsewhere until they achieved renown
among '60s collectors. Heavily indebted (as were so many bands) to
R&B-influenced British heavyweights like the Stones, the Kinks, and the
Yardbirds, the group added a thick dollop of Texas raunch to their fuzzy,
distorted guitars and hell-bent energy. Most importantly, they were
first-rate songwriters, with the breakneck ""Bad Girl"" (later compiled on
Pebbles, Vol. 2), ""Won't Come Back,"" the smoking ""Face to Face,"" ""Can't You
Hear Your Daddy's Footsteps,"" and the folk-rock/Merseybeat hybrid ""Please""
ranking among the top echelon of American '60s garage rock. Their 1967
singles found the group moving into psychedelic territory; some songs
betrayed a Moby Grape influence, and some good melodic numbers were diluted
by poppy arrangements that recalled the Buckinghams and Grass Roots. Lead
singer Chris Gerniottis, only 15 when Zakary Thaks began making records,
joined another interesting Corpus Christi garage/psychedelic group, the
Liberty Bell. ~ Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide
The Bad Seeds were the first rock group of note to come out of Corpus
Christi, Texas, itself a hotbed of garage-rock activity during the
middle/late 1960s. They started when guitarist/singer Mike Taylor and
bassist Herb Edgeington, then member of a local band called the Four Winds,
met up with lead guitarist Rod Prince and drummer Robert Donahoe, who had
been playing in a rival band called the Titans until its demise. Prince
wanted to form a new group, and he, Taylor and Edgeington became the core of
the Bad Seeds, who were signed to the local J-Beck label in 1966. They
stayed together long enough to record three singles during 1966, of which
two, ""A Taste of the Same""/""I'm a King Bee"" and ""All Night Long""/""Sick and
Tired,"" are unabashed classics of blues-based garage-punk, three of them
originals by Taylor (who wrote most of their originals) or Prince. Even
their normally maligned second single, ""Zilch Part 1""/""Zilch Part 2,"" has
some worth as a pretty hot pair of throwaway tracks. The band's sound was
the raunchy Rolling Stones-influenced garage-punk typical of Texas rock
groups in the mid-'60s. 

Following the breakup of the group after the summer of 1966, Mike Taylor
became a writer and producer for the the Zakary Thaks, another Corpus
Christi-based band (who were signed to J-Beck after being spotted playing on
a bill with the Bad Seeds), and also recorded singles in a folk-like mode as
The Fabulous Michael. Rod Prince went on to become a key member of the
legendary band Bubble Puppy, who were signed to Leland Rogers' International
Artists' label, and the post-psychedelic group Demian. ~ Bruce Eder & Richie
Unterberger, All Music Guide

"Order 637 - Capacity Release Price Cap Waiver","Teb,

Could you please confirm the rules regarding the sunset date defined by the Commission as it relates to the capacity release price cap waiver.  I know the date established in the Order is September 30, 2002; however I want to make sure the interpretation is correct.  If a release is less than one year in duration, but extends beyond September 30, 2002, then should it be capped at the pipeline's max tariff rate.  Or, could some try to interpret it to mean that as long as an offer was posted on or before this date for a release period of less than one year, then the release could be awarded at rates in excess of the tariff rate.  I want to make sure that there is no confusion if customers question this.

Additionally, has there been any discussion about extending this beyond the sunset date.  Please advise.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

"Scheduling Alt FT by Price","Per our discussions yesterday, I did find an Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. Order On Rehearing in my file, dated August 5, 1997 in Docket No. RP97-126-002 (80 FERC P61,199) concerning scheduling alt FT by price.  On reviewing it again, some key points were:  

	Allocate based on the highest percentage of the maximum rate - the rate used being the rate for the package of services that includes those secondary rights.
	The Commission maintains that all firm capacity, once scheduled, be curtailed pro rata, without regard to price.

SMILING is infectious, You catch it like the flu 
When someone SMILED at me today, I started SMILING too 
I passed around the corner and someone saw my grin 
When he SMILED, I realized I'd passed it on to him. 
I thought about that smile, then realized its worth, 
A single SMILE just like mine could travel 'round the earth. 
So if you feel a SMILE begin, don't leave it undetected. 

LET'S START AN EPIDEMIC QUICK AND GET THE WORLD INFECTED!

Regarding the end date, we are being required to put some sort of end date into our system.  We can always go back in to extend should the assignment go beyond that date.  Would you like me to extend it for 3 or 6 months, or through the end of 2002?

I'll wait to hear back from Debbie on the coding.  

Thanks for the update!

Hi Teb,

I am trying to verify if Jeanette Doll is still on assignment. Listed below are the Co #s and CC #s that Jeanette has been charging her time to. Could you validate if these cost center numbers are still active or inactive?. Is the Company Name and Department the same?   Also, please let me know if there are any cost center numbers that need to be added or deleted.

Lastly, is there a tentative end date for this assignment?

**************

hi everyone,

VH-1 (the cable music channel) is returning to Houston in
January/February 2002 to film another television movie. This
one is called PMRC, which stands for Parent's Music Resource
Center. Remember in 1985 when Tipper Gore tried to have the
music industry censored, resulting in the Parental Advisory
sticker?

VH-1 has filmed three movies in Houston in the past two
years: AT ANY COST, THE WAY SHE MOVES and most recently TOO
LEGIT: THE M.C. HAMMER STORY (currently airing.)

If you would like to be an extra in the upcoming production
PMRC, please visit southwestcasting.com and get on the
emailing list. You will receive a email notification as soon
as the time and date is set for the extras casting call.
Extras will be paid. All types will be needed, ages 16-80.
There is a special need for Senator- and
Washington-Wife-types.

Please forward this information to anyone you think might be
interested.

Thanks!

Joe G.

"ETS and Corporate Change Control","The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Dec. 14		
From 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., the EDI team will install and upgrade Oracle to version 8.1.7 on EDI_QA.   This change will result in a total disruption of service to the EDI_QA environment.

Dec. 14		
From 10:00 - 11:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will clean up routing between ecn-34-prd-dcr7/8 and ecn-34-trd-dcr1/2 which are part of the old ECT networks.  No impact to the ETS users is expected.

Dec. 14		
From 10:30 p.m. through 12/15 at 2:00 a.m., Enron Network Services will remove routing from the 192.168.73.x interfaces on ENA-CR1-ARD and ENA-CR2-ARD. This change will result in an intermittent disruption of service to devices on the ETS Ardmore networks.  This change will not affect devices on the 10.0.0.0 segment.  The outage is expected to last for less than two minutes.  This change is necessary to fully implement the new MAN.  

Jan. 7		
From 7:00 a.m. through 1/11 at 5:00 p.m., Facilities will perform the annual maintenance on the rooftop chillers.  The chillers will be taken down one at a time during the maintenance.  No impact to ETS is expected.

We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread forever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad - to those who would resort to such extortion.  If we give in now, we will only encourage such acts in the future.  First our microwaves, then our filtered water dispenser, then our refrigerators will become targets of these evil doers.  Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

If you read the January EMCA newsletter, you prolly noticed that there were stories that were amazingly similar to what has been buzzing around on our e-mail-internet site.  Well, I often go to our e-group for information that can be printed in the newsletter, but this month your stories practically were the entire newsletter.  

I hope you don't mind that I took this information and wrote it in the newsletter... Actually, for me, the newsletter editor, it was a goldmine, because those are exactly the types of things that make our newsletter newsy and personal.  I have been wanting restaurant and business reviews (Cheryl has been a big help), and I've been meaning to get down to the new little antique store so I could write about it, but haven't made it during business hours.

Subject:	Notes from 637 Imbal Mtg 9/18/01


Already in TW's Tariff

1.	Dollar valuing.  Need to terminate volumetric OBA's where possible to minimize TW's financial exposure.

Proposed in TW's 637 Filing - Keep

1.	Mandatory cash-out each month (after netting and option to trade).
2.	Definition of 6 indices (vs. 3 in current tariff).
3.	Parties may mutually agree to cash out PNR.  Could probably do today without this language.
4.	Clarification that PNR may be used by Operators.
5.	May use PNR for ""auto-balancing"".

Proposed in TW's 637 Filing - Could ""Trade""

1.	Daily balancing.  Including daily tolerance, daily auto-transfer to PNR & daily pricing.
2.	Smaller tolerance range.  Proposed change from +/- 10% to +/- 5%.

"RE: Capacity Lease (Backhaul) - Gulfstream","With regard to the lease question, the Commission has no problem with capacity leases now.  However, the general rule is that the cost of the lease needs to be set so that the exisiting customers are not harmed.  That raises the question of what the backhaul rate should be.  Of course, the customers and Gulfstream will take conflicting positions on the answer.  We should discuss some of the commercial aspects.  There may be some opportunities.

A backhaul capacity lease was proposed in the multi-party Mobile Bay projects and FERC did not seem to have any philosophical problems with the concept.  I will defer the second question to the real lawyers.

Subject:	Capacity Lease (Backhaul) - Gulfstream

We are currently discussing several potential approaches for a ""Phase VII"" expansion project.  We have preliminary work underway on several potential scenarios, some of which might involve Gulfstream as an upstream transporter.  

As part of these discussions, Gulfstream has inquired about FGT's interest in providing a capacity lease for backhaul service (approximately 20-30 miles - they did not identify the specific market). 

My questions are:
	(1) Backhaul capacity lease with an interstate pipeline - Do you see any problems/issues?  The lease arrangement would be with Guflstream Pipeline.

	(2) If this backhaul lease capacity is used by Gulfstream to provide deliveries to an electric generator, would the FP&L Favored Nations Clause be triggered?

"ETS Corporate Change Control Items","The following items were discussed in this week's ETS Corporate Change Control Items

Sept. 24
From 12:00 a.m. through 10/07 at 11:45 p.m., Enron Network Services is implementing a moratorium on all network changes one week prior through one week after the first move of users to Enron Center South.  This moratorium will probably be limited to routing changes, no new networks, no changes to existing networks, etc.  No impact to ETS networks is expected.

Sept. 29
From 7:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., Facilities will install a water leak detection system and supporting equipment on EB34 server rooms.  They will also perform some miscellaneous tasks.  No impact is expected.

Sept. 29
From 6:00 p.m. through 9/30 at 3:00 a.m., the EDI team will upgrade the edinet.enron.com server hardware and software.  This maintenance will also result in an IP address changes for edinet.enron.com and ecnet.enron.com.  While some of the maintenance will begin at 6:00, there will be no EDI outage until 11:00 p.m.  From 11:00 p.m. through 9/30 at 3:00 a.m., there will be a total disruption of service.

Sept. 29
From 9:00 p.m. through 9/30 at 12:00 a.m., the Unix team will install memory in mailman postmaster.  Internet mail will failover to mailboy during this maintenance.  No impact is expected.

"CPUC Proceedings","Rob, 

As requested, attached below is a summary of current CPUC proceedings which are important to Transwestern.  Our focus has been on these five proceedings as in each instance the outcome potentially impacts take-away capacity at the border and end-user rates and terms and conditions of service in our market area.  The proceedings included are:

I99-07-003	GIR/SoCal Unbundling

I00-11-02	Adequacy of SoCal System

A01-09-024	SoCalGas BCAP
A01-10-005	SDG&E BCAP  (consolidated w/SoCal)

A01-10-011	PG&E Gas Accord

I have included the purpose of each proceeding, Transwestern's participation and position when taken, status of each proceeding and key dates for upcoming events.  Please feel free to call me to discuss any of the proceedings or to answer any questions.  On my next trip to Houston, I'll schedule some time to review these proceedings with anyone interested in further discussion.

"*EMCA* An arrest","
Howdy -

The early morning news on Channel 11 reported the arrest of someone the
cops called ""The Montrose Burglar"".  They said he may be responsible for as
many as ten armed robberies and is being charged with three, and that armed
with a pistol, he would hold up people leaving bars and clubs late at
night.  The mug shot showed a middle aged black guy, balding.  He doesn't
sound like either the Fargo Carjacker or the Fairview Minivan Mugger but
maybe, knock on wood, this arrest will put a liitle dent in the crime
stats.

Subject:	San Juan Expansion Options - Small Volume

Marketing requested Planning to review any and all possibilities to achieve small volume expansions through the San Juan lateral.  Several facility scenarios were investigated by Planning which are in the attached Excel spreadsheet.  Most if not all are too costly to justify installing.  However, there is another option that is not listed in the attached that was a late entry.  Discussions with Engineering have determined that by cooling the inlet air to the turbines would increase the available horsepower.  That in turn would increase the station's overall throughput.  Preliminary studies indicate that approximately 10 MMcf/d of additional throughput could be realized if inlet air cooling is installed.  The + 30% estimate for two units would be $600,000.  BIG bargain compared to the options in the attached file.  The facility installation is not a major job but the FERC approval to utilize additional horsepower could take 6 - 9 months.  Other considerations to review would be the air quality permit for the increase in horsepower, and potential environmental clearances to do construction.  Let me know what you think about this suggestion.  Please feel free to call.

"RE: SoCalGas Developments","I had also received the filing and likewise Susan (Scott) Lindberg had received one.  Susan's copy has been forwarded to Blair/Teb for regulatory review as well as being available in Houston for Marketing to review.  It's a bound document about 2 inches thick including the testimony.  Importantly it includes SoCal's proposal for receipt point capacity.  I've only read the transmittal letter thus far but will continue reviewing it for more detail.  

Steve, would you want to designate someone from Marketing to review key sections?  I would offer to let them know which areas or sections of the filing could use input from Marketing before we decide whether or not to comment on SoCal's proposal or to simply intervene at this time, monitor progress and provide input later in the proceeding if necessary. 

Other comments?  gh

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

Over 300 walkers signed up to walk with the Enron team and more than 150 walkers came out in the storming rain to walk for education.
Over $20,000 in pledges has been collected as of today. 
Great job team! 

Now it's time to finalize collections. Please email me your team captain worksheet and turn in collected pledges by 5 p.m. tomorrow (10/11).  The worksheets will be used to report pledges and collections, report walkers recruited, account for t-shirts, identify UNCF gifts to be awarded, identify walkers who qualify for the Special $100 drawing and complete Enron 2001 Matching. We will also copy and paste the worksheets to create a walker master list. Therefore, it is important that your worksheet columns are in the same order as the attached worksheet. Leave any walker on your worksheet that received an Enron or UNCF t-shirt, even if the potential walker did not turn in the $30 minimum. T-shirts that you received for these walkers must be turned in to me because UNCF requires a sponsor form with a minimum $30 contribution for each t-shirt awarded.  Feel free to call me (ext. 36951) if you have any questions.

I would like to have all pledges collected by Monday, October 15th so that we can pick up our prizes from the UNCF office.



						 


NOTE: I have moved to EB4260. It's hard to find, so call me and I will meet you in the elevator area on the 42nd floor.

"Intercompany Billings Follow-Up","Corporate Charges
	Tracy Geaccone has suggested (and discussed with Terry West in Corporate Planning) that the pipelines be allowed access to the 2002 Plan once it has been loaded in SAP for the Corporate cost centers that bill us. The Plan would be recorded by GL account within each of the applicable cost centers.  Corporate prepares a schedule that shows which cost centers bill us, the methodologies used and the amounts billed.  It would be quite an undertaking because of the number of Corporate cost centers involved, but each of the pipelines would be able to derive a FERC breakdown using the Plan, plus the schedule from Corporate.  The main issue would be manpower.  Tracy mentioned the possibility of having one of the associate analysts perform this task, but said that the Plan would not be finalized and loaded until probably the end of November.

	Is this an acceptable solution?  Do we need a meeting to discuss this further?  I am still waiting for return phone calls from Enron Networks and Global Finance.  There are just a few Global Finance cost centers that bill us.  However, the method proposed above may also be a solution for Enron Networks billings.


Enron Property and Services Corp.
	The mandate that these billings be recorded in individual cost centers rather than at a company level originated with Tracy Geaccone with a promise of cost savings to Stan.  However, Tracy told me that rather than coding to a cost center, she has requested that the coding be to a FAR order.  I told her that would mean multiple FAR orders.  Her thinking is that each cost center already has a FAR order.  I attempted to describe our use of custom variants.  She said that she would work through Bob Chandler.  If we intend to continue using the custom variants, it would mean creating a large number of new FAR orders.

	Again, is this an acceptable solution?  Do we need a meeting to discuss this further?

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Feb. 2
From 6:00 - 9:00 a.m., the Envision team will re-index the databases.  This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices. 

Feb. 16
From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.  This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.  LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.

"Re: *EMCA* An additional Restaurant Review..... Cole's on Waugh","I liked Cole's, too, and especially the quiet, homey atmosphere.  Richard Cole
has been around the local restaurant scene for years, and he and his partner Paul
did almost all of the build-out themselves, and Richard is chef.  It's nice to
see local folks open a little local restaurant.  Maybe they'll be another
Barnaby's success story.

Speaking of which, it's all but impossible to get into the newly opened Barnaby's
on West Gray--already.  And at least three other restaurants have died at that
location--amazing!

"RE: *EMCA* City lot size ordinance","Some info is available through the city website.  Details for qualification
and application are very similar to the prevailing building line ordinance.

Basic rule is that 75% of the lots on a pair of opposing blockfaces must be
within 10% of the average lot size in order for the city to define that
there exists a prevailing lot size.

Applicants must show support for a prevailing lot size of more than 50% of
the owners of the lots in question, and submit their application to the
city.  Application must include maps showing the area applied for, the lot
sizes, and the land usage in each lot (commercial/residential/vacant).

Subject: *EMCA* City lot size ordinance


Hello all,  Lorraine and I have been unable to get ourselves down to 
the meetings lately.  Being new parents has us pretty exhausted but 
we are getting the hang of it.  Tyler James is growing so fast.  
Maybe next month we will make it.  

Anyway, we did have a question about the newly adopted city lot size 
ordinance that was passed in December.  Is there something printed 
that specifically addresses how this affects our neighborhood?  Do we 
know what the average lot size is in Montrose?  Does this mean that 
no more old classic homes can be torn down to build 3 townhomes?

Also, we were wondering if anyone has noticed the parking problems 
lately due to the Eclesiastic church on Taft?  They seem to provide 
no parking for their events which seem to occur more often every 
month.  They have done alot of work on that church and I have never 
noticed one single permit posted on their structure.  We don't really 
know these people and have nothing against them but don't they need 
to comply with city parking and building codes?

Maybe these issues can be addressed in next months newsletter?

"RE: morn meet 1/17/02","Shelley,  Tim is looking into these balances.  Tejas has an imbalance we're checking into that developed in December for 211K.  It appears estimates were used for actual flow & we don't have a lot of confidence that that much gas actually flowed.  Mike Wagner tells me the check meter is not working and he has had no luck getting anyone to fix it.  Tim is following up w/Tejas to find out what the actual flow for Dec was.  Also, we're currently working trying to take some of the balances in payback to cover FPL working off their imbalance during the outages we have in process.  We're implementing a process with the team to ensure scheduled quantites are tied out each month so Tim & Cynthia can concentrate on actual flow volumes and reconciliation of any old unreconciled imbalances.

I'm concerned about the magnitude of the supply imbalance that we've built up again.  Tim - are these numbers verified and up to date.  Can I get a breakdown of the 1.5 Bcf and the 700 MMcf current month portion.   It seems like we just worked down these balances in the fall and now we're building these balances back up again.  

If these supply imbalances are building up as a result of Phase V outages perhaps the payback gas use should be separately captured and recorded against the project.

"Revised NNG Recap / UAF numbers","The original 12/2001 recap sent out had an error which effected previous months plus December UAF numbers.  The problem occurred when a station was accidentally removed from the pipeline balance setup within PGAS.  The attached Recap has been corrected to include this meter and 2001 UAF does NOT look good for NNG.

Current NNG UAF:
December:	-0.81%		-1,023,077 DTH
Year to Date:	-0.39%		-5,155,854 DTH

This makes 8 months in a row of high UAF loss for NNG.  

Please try to attend today's UAF to discuss this issue and help put together an action plan to locate and correct problems.

 I have an electric fogger, Amy, if youwould like to use it. However, i

dissapates. It has worked wonders. There is also a spray that youjust hook 
up to you hose and spray your yard, bushes and under your house. It is 
non-toxic and works really well also.
Let me know if you would like to use the fogger.

It's funny how different people have different experiences.  We have had numerous problems with the water lines in front of our home--the last resulted in a $798 water bill and we were told to fix it ourselves (get a plumber, actually), even though the city broke and then repaired (?) the line a month earlier. 

Anyway, to make a long story short, I used the e-mail list of city councilpersons that Annise supplied to send out an appeal for help.  EVERY councilperson--EXCEPT BRUCE TATRO--responded immediately!  (Annise's office was particularly caring--Thank you!)  The city repaired the problem within one day and refunded $762 to us. 

Thanks to EMCA's newsgroup and Annise Parker's list, I guess it IS possible to fight city hall!

I tried again today, Monday, to reach Sgt. Vollert or some competent person 
at the storefront with no luck.  In the year or so while we were living in 
Spring Branch Bruce Tatro, who I hope will be mayor some day, responded to 
a police problem we were having in the neighborhood by sending an HPD 
sergeant (who I hope will be police chief some day) to our house who told 
me how hard it is to get any work out of many HPD officers and how even 
harder it is to fire them.

From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Announcements_Corp_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Stan Horton- Chairman and CEO of Enron Global Services@ENRON
Sent:	Monday, September 24, 2001 3:07 PM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Organization Changes

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

Subject:	OBA & Scheduling Alt FT by Price Tariff Filings

In an effort to get cash in the door for TW and to maximize revenue opportunity for TW in the coming year, I think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the FERC as soon as possible. 

One would be the OBA filing we have been discussing (and trying to support with historical data) to get automatic cash-out on OBA's in ""constrained"" areas on TW.

Second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate FT points.  This may be the time (the market to California is not so hot) to try to implement this.  I know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them.  

Glen is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the OBA tariff filing.  Could we discuss scheduling alternate FT by price at the same meeting?

"SFTS conversions","I have a question about the SFTS conversions that were done a while back so that the customer could utilize our capacity release program.  I noticed that The City of Chattahoochee converted their SFTS to FTS-1 and that the temporary acquisitions on their FTS-1 have a gap.  More specifically, they have a release in place for 10/1/02 thru 4/30/03 and the next release begins 10/1/03 thru 4/30/04.  Do the releases have to be consecutive in order for them to retain their conversion to FTS-1?  Because they will not have a release in place for May thru Sept. of 2003 according to their releases.  Is this wrong?  I haven't checked to see if this occurs on any of the other coversions and will if this is an issue.  Please advise.  nb

We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread forever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad - to those who would resort to such extortion.  If we give in now, we will only encourage such acts in the future.  First our microwaves, then our filtered water dispenser, then our refrigerators will become targets of these evil doers.  Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!

"Emergency Response Information","ETS is developing a web-based Emergency Response Information (ERI) system to provide access to employee contact information including work phone, home phone, cell phone, fax number and pager numbers. To facilitate and manage the collection of personal contact data, a new field has been added to eHRonline. Beginning Monday, October 1, all ETS employees will be prompted to either ACCEPT or DECLINE publication of personal data (i.e., home phone number) when first entering the eHRonline system. All ETS employees should access the eHRonline system at their first opportunity to respond to this new request.

While certain positions within ETS mandate disclosure of personal contact data (i.e., home phone number) for emergency response purposes, in other cases disclosure of this information is at the discretion of the employees. If you are an ETS Operations employee and do not want your home phone number published, please contact your Director prior to electing not to publish your personal contact information. 

To access eHRonline, go to the ETS HRWeb link: https://ehronline.enron.com/ and select eHRonline. Employees must enter their SAP Personnel Number and Password to enter the system.  If you do not know your SAP Personnel Number or Password, please contact the Integrated Solutions Center at (713)-345-4727.

"Weekly Report of 1/25/02","California:

CP02-41-000  PG&E Section 7 FERC Proceeding.  On Monday, Jan 28, 2002, Transwestern will file an intervention in the PG&E FERC filing to convert their current intrastate backbone system into an interstate open access pipeline.

A01-09-024  SoCalGas BCAP.  A Meet and Confer meeting was held on Tuesday to discuss a revised procedural schedule.  Given the ALJ's directive that SoCal must submit a revised BCAP application to reflect the unbundling decision and to include both the LRMC cost methodology and the embedded cost methodology on March 4th, two procedural schedules were submitted to the ALJ for consideration.  SoCal presented a schedule which retains the original Hearing dates to begin on May 21, 2002 and with a final decision by the end of 2002 to allow for implementation of revised rates on Jan. 1, 2003.  The Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA) submitted a schedule pushing the hearings back to late August and seeking a Commission decision by the end of March 2003.  The parties were unable to reach a consensus, however more parties objected to the SoCal schedule than the ORA schedule.  An ALJ decision should be forthcoming. 

Arizona:

AZ Legislature.  Due to revenue shortfalls in the current fiscal year, Gov. Hull has announced that  an emergency session beginning Jan. 29, 2002, will need to be called to deal with an estimated $200 million deficit.  On the table for possible cuts are surpluses in special funds such as the tobacco education fund, the Heritage Fund for parks and game preserves and a special lake fund.  Others feel its time to use the remaining ""rainy day"" fund of $160 Million.  However with a $850 Million deficit expected in 2003, the Gov. wants to keep this fund intact.

I spoke with Greg Healy of SoCalGas today regarding the revised offer Transwestern provided to SoCalGas before Christmas.  He said they have questions and requested a conference call early next week so that they can better understand our proposal and go forward.  I have tentatively scheduled the call for Tuesday, January 8, from 3-4 our time.   Greg indicated that it would be business people and their lawyer, Dave Gilmore.  

Sharon, pls. set up a conference bridge number for us.  I was going to call Rick Miles to let him know about the status of our discussions.  He had called me after we sent SoCalGas the revised offer about wanting to know where we were.  Does anyone have a problem with me calling Rick??  Maria

"Re: *EMCA* VH-1 Clark Gable","I think once this movie comes out we need to have a Hilary
Smith day!  A ticker-tape parade (with a detour down
Avondale!), autograph-signing, red-carpet, etc.  There's no
reason for us to take any further guff from Avondale on this
Hollywood movie star issue.  Clark Gable is not even alive
any more as far as I'm aware; at the very least he hasn't
made a popular film in some time.

"Power Outage at Enron Building","
Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

"Re: *EMCA* VH-1 Clark Gable","The owner is Jack Blalock, who owned BackSttreet Caf?, plus some other
places, I think.  Jack died suddenly recently (heart attack, as I remember).
He wss only about 50 or so.

The scoop on Clark Gable is, ss I recall, that he was here for aprt of a
summer while taking dancing lessons at that house, where he lodged, as well.
Hr wss only here a short whiler, but locals sre so proud of that fact that
they have called the charming stucco three-story, two-rooms-on-each-floor
building the ""Clark Gsable House"" ever since.  The gardens surrounding the
'compound' are lovely.  You can't see much from the street, but just the
house is worth taking a walk down to see it.  And after all, iti's a bit of
local lore.

Subject: Quote for the day, #1,222.


""'Afghanistan will need $10 billion in the next five years, over and above any relief already pledged, the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, told the delegates. Today, [Afghan interim leader] Hamid Karzai pledged to hire a ""reputable international firm to audit our expenditures on a regular basis"" and insisted, ""The elimination of corruption is one of my top priorities.""
 
The New York Times, Jan. 21, 2002 
 
March 3, 2002 
 
Afghanistan today hired Arthur Andersen as its auditor. 'I opened up the Yellow Pages, and they came first alphabetically,' Mr. Karzai told a press conference. Upon hearing snickers in the crowd, Mr. Karzai added, 'What? What is it? Is there something I should know?'
 
May 6, 2003
 
In a shocking turn of events, Afghanistan today reported that it had a budget surplus for the current year. In an interview, Mr. Karzai attributed the country's stunning shift of fortunes to the spirit of the Afghan people, the resolve of the Afghan government and a series of highly complex leveraging arrangements that have 'stripped out' much of the unpredictability of global markets via derivatives held chiefly by government ministers through offshore holding companies. 'But really,' Mr. Karzai added, 'it's more the first two than the third.'
 
Feb. 8, 2004 
 
'The Afghan Miracle,' as some economists have dubbed it, continues apace. In an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr. Karzai quickly grew impatient with questions about how a nation with few natural resources and no major industries could so quickly amass a gross national product twice the size of Japan's. 'Listen, I can't help you if you're too dim to understand this,' Mr. Karzai said. 'Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a dinner date.'
 
March 12, 2005 
 
Thousands of Afghans today cheered as the Eiffel Tower was lowered into position in downtown Kabul. Afghan leader Hamid Karzai, who bought the tower 'on a whim' from the French government last spring, provided a brief moment of levity when, shouting orders to the helicopter pilot, he exclaimed, 'Hey, let's put it on top of the Tower of Pisa!' As the pilot changed course, Mr. Karzai quickly added, 'Just kidding! Put it next to Big Ben, like we planned.'

Aug. 12, 2008 
 
'When they came and repossessed the moon,' Hamid Karzai answered, when asked to name the hardest part about Afghanistan's declaration of bankruptcy last July. Asked which of his decisions he regretted most, Mr. Karzai answered quickly: 'Buying the naming rights to Canada seemed like a clever idea at the time, but having two countries named Afghanistan simply got confusing.'
 
Mr. Karzai sighed, 'It was all very unfortunate. But I guess it's just - what's the phrase? - part of the genius of capitalism.'
 
Tim Carvell, American journalist, ""New Regime, New Accountant,"" The New York Times, 1/25/02.

Help Joe -- what is this about?  Is there some possibility of the FERC curbing our ability to use OFOs?  This is an absolutely critical tool for us to keep -- even though we seldom use.  Where/when can we make our case.

"RE: Paper Situation","To SADIST Organization (Just plain ""Sad"" for short) 
You will NOT be able to undermine the EPLF, CCA, and DITPAC presence in the bathrooms, kitchens, Energizer and /or Plaza Java.  We are the largest organization in the Enworld!  We are well-equipped with large communication networks that spread clear across the street.  DITPAC has since joined EPLA and CCA to destroy you inhumane network that does nothing but exploit the ""toaster gap."" Our new cartel will now be known as S.K.I.L.L.I.N.G. (Supreme Knowledge in Living Large in Natural Gas).
These threats you have mentioned below have been sent to the EPLF, CCA, and DITPAC Cartel and we discovered that we don't even use toilet paper or napkins... big threat! 
We will only return the toaster and blender under the following conditions :
1. Paper supply remains in high demand for our organizations. 
2. SADIST group join forces with S.K.I.L.L.I.N.G. to form a kinder gentler Enworld.
and finally
3. Unlimited access to caffeine-laced products for our friends at DITPAC.
 Regards,
The S.K.I.L.L.I.N.G. Cartel

To EPLF and its sympathizers:   Unless the toaster is returned immediately, SADIST will commence an escalating series of  actions designed to bring all such terrorists to their knees.  We realize there may be some collateral damage, and for this we are truly sorry.  But we must end toaster terror forever.  Beginning at 0900 hours on 10 January 2002, SADIST will commence the following series of actions (each subsequent action will commence 2 hours after the preceeding sanction):
1. All deliveries of new business cards will be suspended
2. Napkins and paper towels will be removed from the kitchens
3. Post-it notes will be confiscated from all locations
4. Paper towels will be removed from all bathrooms
5. Toilet paper will be removed from all bathrooms ( Enron stock certificates will be issued for humanitarian reasons)

If the toaster still has not been returned, SADIST will be forced to remove all COFFEE FILTERS from the building, including the Energizer and Plaza Java.  Do not doubt our will to use this ultimate weapon, after all we are SADIST.

It has come to the attention of the Dedicated Information Technology Programmers Addicted to Caffeine that we are somehow getting the short end of the stick in these negotiations.  We are generally used to this, but this is the last straw!  Being an often overlooked faction in these wars, we are however, very powerful.  Unless you provide us with the affricated drinks we require to survive, we will sabotage these negotiations.  We start by asking the following questions:  What are your requirements for paper?  Have you documented these requirements.  What is the cost justification for ordering this paper?  What printers are you using?  Does IT have to support these printers?  That will cost extra money.  What were the different requirements surrounding your use of the toaster?  Do you toast bread and waffles?  What other uses do you have for the toaster?  Anything not specifically included in your written requirements will be rejected as a scope enhancement and will cost more money or cause a delay in the return of your toaster.

To avoid further delays in the negotiations, please deliver bribes in 6-packs of 24-ounce bottles of the following:  Dr. Pepper, Mountain Dew, RC Cola, Jolt.  These payments should be left in the kitchen refrigerator so that they will be cold when we drink them in the morning.

Remember, paper without a working printer is the wrong print queue.  A toaster without power is a metal storage box.  We have the power and will use it.

We are willing to sit at the table and negotiate.  SADIST has pushed us to the brink!  We have infiltrated the SADIST camp and now are in possession of a toaster, AND blender.  We have joined sides with EPLF to demand that our paper supply stays in high demand.  If our demands are not met by the end of today, we will be forced to sign over all our Enron stock options to your organization.  This will cause your organization to implode!!

We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread forever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad - to those who would resort to such extortion.  If we give in now, we will only encourage such acts in the future.  First our microwaves, then our filtered water dispenser, then our refrigerators will become targets of these evil doers.  Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!

Chris Snyder with FPU called and asked if the New Smyrna point, poi 16160 on contract 100740 (which is the only delivery point on that contract that they permanently acquired through capacity release) could be made a division.  The point was acquired through a permanent capacity release transaction as a single point. 

The problem is that they requested to combine this point into their current dpoa, contract 5002 that has points behind divisions.  The allocation reports he gets do not reflect this point since it is not in a division.  Can we make a point a division just so the reports can ""pick up"" the point?  Chris also mentioned that he does not want this point in a separate dpoa because he wants to be able to take advantage of the section 11 rights with their other delivery points on their dpoa.  

Frazier and Teb, please let me know if we can do this so that we can make the appropriate changes in our system.  nb

FERC Proposes New Rules On Energy Co Affiliate Dealings

09/26/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Commission proposed Wednesday new restrictions governing natural gas pipeline and electric utility affiliate dealings. 
The commission unanimously agreed to initiate a rulemaking to tighten regulations prohibiting pipelines and utilities from providing market-sensitive information to their marketing affiliates. 
FERC rules allow monopoly pipeline and utility companies to sell natural gas and electricity at market rates, providing they adopt codes of conduct that prevent the passage of information giving a competitive advantage to their marketing affiliates. 
The proposed changes reflect the sweeping convergence between the natural gas and power sectors in the years since FERC deregulated the pipeline industry in the 1980s. 
FERC's ""code-of-conduct"" rules prohibit pipelines from sharing market-sensitive information with their gas-marketing affiliates. But the rules don't address the pipeline's power marketing affiliates. 
The commission's proposed rules would expand the code-of-conduct rules to address all marketing affiliates, including those involved in financial transactions that don't entail the physical delivery of energy. 
The template for the proposed changes can be found in the conditions FERC imposed in a 1999 order authorizing the acquisition of Pittsburgh-based Consolidated Natural Gas by Dominion Resources (D). The commission approved the electricity-natural gas convergence merger, contingent on Dominion agreeing to adopt codes of conduct applying equally to its gas and power marketing affiliates. 
FERC's rule changes would apply to other electric utilities with pipeline investments, such as CMS Energy (CMS), Duke Energy (DUK) and American Electric Power Co. (AEP). 
It wasn't immediately clear how the changes would affect joint operating agreements, such as the one between Entergy Corp. (ETR) and privately held Koch Industries. 
The largest impact will be for large pipeline companies with extensive power marketing operations and investments in power plants. 
For example, El Paso Corp. (EPG), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Enron Corp. (ENE), represent about 70% of the interstate pipeline industry, and are among the nation's top power marketers and merchant power plant developers. 
The changes under consideration stem from the commission's investigation of El Paso Natural Gas Co.'s controversial contract with a marketing affiliate for pipeline capacity into California. 
The affiliate transaction has been blamed for California's dramatic runup in natural gas prices over the past year, which contributed to the state's unprecedented high electricity cost last year.

FERC Grants PD for Tuscarora Lateral, Approves Northern Abandonment 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has issued a favorable preliminary determination on non-environmental grounds to Tuscarora Gas Transmission's Wadsworth Lateral, a 14.2-mile pipeline extension and associated facilities that would increase Tuscarora's transportation capacity by 95,912 Dth/d. The lateral would extend from Tuscarora's mainline in northern Washoe County, NV, to an interconnect with Paiute Pipeline in Nevada. 
The expansion of the 229-mile pipeline system, which extends from Malin, OR, to a growing Nevada market, would serve two new power generation facilities in Nevada near Tracy and Wadsworth. Duke Energy plans to construct a 540 MW plant near Wadsworth, and Morgan Stanley is now constructing the 360 MW Naniwa Energy facility near Tracy. 
The added capacity also would supplement the growing gas distribution needs of Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Southwest Gas Corp., which collectively distribute natural gas to all of northern Nevada and portions of Northern California. 
If FERC approves the application, Tuscarora said it would begin construction in April 2002 and begin service by the end of that year. The $60 million expansion is supported by long-term, firm transportation contracts ranging from 10-to-15 years that are contingent upon completion. 
FERC also gave Northern Natural Gas the authority to abandon by sale its far east leg to Wisconsin Gas for use by affiliate Guardian Pipeline. The Northern line runs from Boone County, IA, to an interconnect with ANR in Rock County, WI. It extends to a delivery point near Eagle, WI. This nine mile, 24-inch diameter line is located primarily in Walworth and Waukesha, WI. 
FERC has given Guardian Pipeline authorization to eliminate construction of its Eagle lateral, which would have run parallel to the Northern line. The 8.5 mile, 16-inch diameter Eagle Lateral would have run from a connection with Guardian to Eagle, WI, at a delivery point with nonjurisdictional facilities of Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Electric. 

TRANSWESTERN TOUTS SUCCESS OF OPEN SEASON FOR SUN DEVIL PIPELINE

Enron Corp.'s subsidiary Transwestern Pipeline Co. says it received requests for more than 1.3 Bcf/d of capacity for its proposed Sun Devil Pipeline expansion project that would transport San Juan Basin natural gas production to market areas in Phoenix and California by January 2004. 
Transwestern's Sun Devil Pipeline was announced as another of several new western states' gas transportation options. A Transwestern official said the gas-fired electric generation market in Arizona is the second largest growth market in the U.S. The company is working with shippers to finalize transportation agreements and expects to file its Sun Devil application with the FERC early next year. Shippers needing additional information can contact Project Director Kevin Hyatt at 713-853-5559 or email at Kevin.hyatt@enron.com. 
Transwestern announced its plans on August 8. The proposed project will include new compression and pipeline looping plus a new lateral, the Flagstaff - Phoenix, Arizona lateral, which would add approximately 175 miles to Transwestern's existing system. The project's estimated in-service date is January 2004. The proposed facility modifications will enable Transwestern to deliver an incremental 780,000 dth/d from the Blanco Hub located in San Juan County, New Mexico to the Thoreau area, an incremental 90,000 dth/d from Thoreau to the California border, and an incremental 450,000 dth/d from Thoreau to Phoenix. Potential supply receipt points from the San Juan Basin at the Blanco Hub are BRT/Val Verde Plant, WFS/Milagro Plant, WFS/Kutz Plant, and TransColorado/Blanco. Transwestern will consider interconnecting with other upstream and downstream pipelines, subject to the mutual agreement of the pipelines. The estimated maximum one-part reservation rates, exclusive of fuel and all surcharges, for firm service through the capacity described in this open season are as follows: San Juan to Thoreau -$.0985 dth/d; Thoreau to California -- $.240 dth/d; and Thoreau to Phoenix -- $0.454 dth/d. (See REPORT NO. 2348, pp6-7.) 
Transwestern's Red Rock Project (CP01-115), approved by FERC earlier this summer and under construction, will add 150 MMcf/d of new capacity for deliveries to the California border in mid-2002.

FERC Proposes Rulemaking, Plans Meetings 
In the same way your teacher loaded you down with books and assignments on the first day of the school year, new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Pat Wood, presiding over his first meeting Wednesday. He put a whole slew of initiatives in motion, setting meetings, rulemakings, and calling for comments. 
Sorting it out: 
The Commission voted out a proposed rulemaking that which would extend the standards of conduct to fence off federally regulated transmission monopolies, both gas pipelines and electric transmission lines, from any other affiliate, including financial affiliates (see related story). For gas pipelines, which have been unbundled for a number of years and subject to affiliate codes of conduct for an equal number of years, the proposed rule will not be as onerous as it will for electric utilities, many of which are still bundled. This will mean, however, that gas transmission utilities must maintain firewalls between themselves and power affiliates, as well as gas marketing affiliates. Turn in your comments, please. 
By its second meeting in October, FERC will have a detailed business plan, including priorities and completion dates for its Oct. 1, 2001 to Oct. 1, 2002 fiscal year. Wood directed a panel of senior staff members and another of junior staff members and union representatives to come up with the plan. The commissioners voted Wednesday to amend their existing five-year plan to emphasize their major new emphasis on market monitoring and mitigation. 
FERC will be holding regional meetings on gas and electric infrastructure. It will start with a meeting on the western infrastructure following the Nov. 1-2 Western Governors Association meeting in Seattle. Wood said he expected federal and state regulators, and others to participate. A meeting for the Northeast may be scheduled in December, with sessions for the South and Midwest to come later. Attendance is not mandatory. 
FERC will cooperate with the Department of Energy in two technology-oriented sessions, one to explore technology solutions such as remote metering to capturing retail and wholesale consumer demand response in mid-February and another to investigate new transmission technology in mid-January. 
Don't be surprised to see a lot of topics debated at FERC's regular open meetings. The sunshine laws which prohibit more than two commissioners from discussing FERC business except in an open meeting, is confining, Wood said. (Usually commission staff runs back and forth among commissioners to establish positions before the meetings). Wood would like to have more discussions out in the open to work things out, and also to let the public know ""not just what we are doing, but why we are doing it."" 
And also, be prepared to pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America from now on at any FERC meeting presided over by Chairman Wood. The chairman also asked for a moment of silence Wednesday for the victims of the Sept. 11 attack.

Proposed Rule Extends Marketing Affiliate Regulations to All Affiliates 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioners Wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers, including both natural gas pipelines and power lines, to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate. 
Previously, the rules simply required creation of a firewall, including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel, between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates. The proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate, gas or electric, including financial affiliates. 
The Commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates, which still in many cases have bundled operations. One option would enforce complete separation, while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load. Staff and Commissioners Wood, William Massey and Nora Brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel, so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non-affiliated competitors did not have access to. 
Commissioner Linda Breathitt, however, argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load. Breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities, she was concerned about the timing. ""I see no compelling reason at this time; there have been no complaints and no evidence."" She said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction. ""I agree with concept philosophically, but I think there will be other opportunities later on, after we do a little more bridge-building with state commissions."" 
Wood said he understood ""the political issue here with respect to federal-state relations, but I think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated."" Staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems, waivers could be granted. Staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel. ""If I am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load, I can go into the control room and get all the information I want,"" one staffer responded. 
Wood proposed, and the commissioners ratified, a proposed rule with no exceptions, but which makes clear that in the final rule the Commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required. Commenting parties should provide cost/benefit analysis on both sides of the question. State commissions are also invited to comment. Wood had suggested the Commission extend the separation to all sales employees, ""but make it clear that if we don't hear from people that they really want this separation, we ain't going to do it."" 

Govt keen to solve Enron crisis

STATESMAN NEWS SERVICE & AGENCIES NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Sept. 26. An inter-ministerial committee of Union secretaries is monitoring the Enron crisis regularly, to facilitate some kind of early solution to the Enron imbroglio involving the Dabhol power project, the power minister, Mr Suresh Prabhu, said here today, while refusing to divulge the options being explored. 
An institutional framework committee, made up of the finance secretary Mr Ajit Kumar, power secretary Mr Ashok K Basu, law secretary Mr R L Meena and the petroleum secretary Mr V N Kaul, has been monitoring the developments on the project front, and regularly interacting with the parties Mr Prabhu said at a briefing.
We want an early solution to the problem, but the Centre has a very restricted role, limited only to facilitate an amicable solution, he said. 
Mr Prabhu refused comment on Enron chairman, Mr Kenneth Lays reported letter to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, seeking $5 billion in damages for terminating the contract, but said if by writing letters problems can be solved, we can also write letters. He said the government and the Cabinet have been kept informed of the status of the negotiations but it would be premature to speak at this stage on the problem which has its genesis in the contract signed in 1992. 
DPC AGM: Notwithstanding its depleting financial conditions, Dabhol Power Company has recorded a higher net profit of Rs 208 crore for the year ended 2000-01, compared with Rs 198 crore in the previous year. 
Disclosing this at the annual general meeting here today, the Enron India chief, Mr Wade Cline, said that the promoters of DPC would be making efforts to fetch additional finances from the institutions to complete the remaining 10 per cent construction work of the 2,184-MW power project at Guhaghar in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. 
Godbole report: The recommendations of the Godbole Committee, that held renegotiations with Enron on the future of DPC, are likely to remain on paper. 
This was clear from the Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr Vilasrao Deshmukhs post-Cabinet-meeting statement today when he said the government noted certain recommendations of the Godbole panel following several round of talks with officials of Enron-DPC over the past five months. 
Mr Deshmukh said these recommendations would guide the government in future while negotiating fresh projects. 
The fate of DPC will thus remain undecided. In the last Cabinet meeting, the Maharashtra government announced terms of reference for an inquiry commission, which would be set up to probe the entire Enron-MSEB deal ab initio. However, the government is still to name a retired Supreme Court Judge to head the commission. 
Mr Madhav Godbole, a former bureaucrat, had clearly suggested that the panel should call off renegotiations, since Enron had announced its desire to walk out of the DPC. He said other states such as Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan were ready to purchase Enron power, provided the rate per unit ranged between Rs 2.25 and Rs 2.40. This was rejected by Enron. 
Other recommendations noted by the State include: The Union Government which has given counter guarantee of Rs 2,500 crore, should raise bonds of the same amount and give them to Maharashtra as interest-free loan.


US Physical Natural Gas Prices Fall; Light Demand Seen

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Wednesday on light demand, as traders hoped to take advantage of cash-outs on pipelines, marketers said. 
""Not much is getting done for next month,"" one veteran trader said. ""It's (Tuesday) all over again."" 
He said traders are hoping they can ""get away with as much as possible on those cash-outs and pray they don't get a call from pipelines"" asking them to ante up on the $2.15/MMBtu and above prices from earlier in the week. 
As for next-month bidding, ""everyone was asking,"" but not much was getting accomplished on baseload trading for October physical gas, a trader said. 
Wednesday, prices were at a premium to the New York Mercantile Exchange to start the session, but ended up either in convergence or slightly in contango, he said. 
Looking ahead, some incremental demand may be seen next month, as some utilities switch to natural gas from fuel oil and a number of nuclear energy sites go off-line for maintenance, one veteran trader said. 
October, a shoulder month, tends to be a major price discount month, he said. On the Nymex there's presently a 42-cent difference between the outgoing October contract and the November contract. The November-November 2002 spread is more than 80 cents. 
Wednesday, traders again saw tight ranges as the Nymex October contract traded under the spot cash bid-ask price, which are both at 30-month lows. 
Traders are in the midst of a three-day monthly bid week as they set baseload pricing for October. 
The Nymex Oct natural gas futures contract expired at $1.83 a million British thermal units, down 9.5 cents. November settled at $2.253/MMBtu, down 4.7 cents. 
The American Gas Association said 91 billion cubic feet of gas was added to storage, and the bearish report sparked a selldown in October to $1.76/MMBtu. 
At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, the delivery point for Nymex gas, prices fell 5 cents-8 cents to a $1.85-$1.92/MMBtu closing range. 
First-of-month index for the Henry Hub is around $2.34/MMBtu. 
Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done at $2.03-$2.15/MMBtu, up 5 cents-6 cents. 
At the Arizona-California Border, where gas from El Paso's pipeline begins delivery to Southern California, buyers paid $1.72-$1.81/MMBtu, down 4 cents-5 cents. Index for September is at $2.66/MMBtu. 
At PG&E Citygate, traders paid $1.85-$2.05/MMBtu, down 3 cents on the bid, up 8 cents on the ask. September first-of-month index is at $2.71/MMBtu. 
At the Katy hub in East Texas, prices were in a $1.81-$1.87/MMBtu range, down 6 cents. First-of-month September index is $2.37/MMBtu. 
At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $1.65-$1.78/MMBtu, down 3 cents-9 cents. Index is at $2.32/MMBtu, traders said.

Enron unit Transwestern Pipeline has received requests for more than 1.3 bcfd of capacity on its proposed 400-mile Sun Devil Pipeline expansion project, which would bring natural gas from New Mexico's San Juan basin to market in Phoenix, then to California by January 2004. ""Sun Devil is an important project that will serve the gas-fired electric generation market in Arizona, which is the second-largest growth market in the US,"" Transwestern said. The company presently is working with shippers to finalize transportation agreements. It plans to apply with FERC early next year. The company also said its Red Rock pipeline project will make 150 MMcfd of gas capacity available for delivery into California in mid-2002.

REVEALED Finding natural gas was once a matter of luck -- surface seeps provided the only real clue. Eventually, though, people realized that seeps often occurred on anticlinal or dome-like slopes, indicating the presence of an underground trap. In the early 1900s, oil companies began relying on geologists to help them read what the rocks had to say, but it was many years before seismic technology could give a picture of rock formations hidden deep in the Earth. These days, specialized vibroseis trucks use mechanical vibrations to create seismic waves. Costing US$350,000 each, the trucks weigh from 18,000 to 30,000 kg and travel in groups of four or five. They are often called ""dancing elephants,"" operating in unison at 100-metre intervals. An on-board hydraulic system presses a central plate against the ground, lifting the truck into the air and vibrating it over a controlled frequency band. The resulting waves are reflected from rock layers in the Earth -- different types of rock reflect waves differently, much as a ball bounced on pavement will bounce higher than a ball bounced on sand. The returning waves are then measured by sensitive geophones, or jugs, strung out every 25 metres along the ground. Supercomputers process the data to generate a 2-D or 3-D picture of the underground structures. In the end, the only sure way to know if gas exists is to drill, but these days the final decision is based on much more than a hunch and a prayer, since so much is at stake: about $900,000, the average cost to complete a gas well in western Canada. 
SNIFFED Natural gas at the wellhead contains a potentially poisonous contaminant called hydrogen sulphide, or H2S. Natural gas that contains more than 1% of it is called ""sour"" gas. It has a strong odour, similar to rotten eggs. About 30% of Canada's total natural gas production is sour, most of it found in Alberta and B.C. By contrast, discoveries in the Arctic and off the East Coast contain less than 1% H2S and are called ""sweet."" If the gas is sour, it is ""sweetened"" by converting up to 99% of the H2S into elemental sulphur for use in fertilizers and for export. The remaining H2S is flared, a controversial incineration process that results in the conversion of H2S to sulphur dioxide, which is released into the atmosphere. (An excellent account of the controversy can by found in Andrew Nikiforuk's book Saboteurs: Wiebo Ludwig's War Against Big Oil, to be published this month.) Whether sweet or sour, the natural gas used to heat our homes must be processed before it is pipeline-ready for shipment. Processing occurs at plants close to the production areas or at straddle extraction plants on major pipeline routes. In Canada, there are 837 processing plants, 756 of them in Alberta. The four largest processors are: Husky Energy Inc. (51 plants), Anderson Exploration Ltd. (49), Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (47) and Conoco Canada Ltd. (35). 
SQUEALED ""Smart pigs"" aren't actually pigs. They're sophisticated tools that travel inside pipelines checking for corrosion and evidence of stress or cracking in the pipe. Early versions were called pigs because they squealed as they moved inside the pipe. Propelled by the gas, they travel at speeds from 0.8 to 16 km per hour. Only about six companies in the world build and inspect pipelines with pigs, which have cost up to US$1 million for researchand development. Pigs range in size from 89 mm to 1.4 m in diameter and can be as long as 6 metres. Special pig ""launch and trap facilities"" are built along the length of the pipeline to allow for insertion and removal at various intervals. 
TRAPPED In nature, natural gas, made predominantly of methane -- four hydrogen atoms attached to one carbon atom -- is found mixed with other hydrocarbons such as ethane, propane and butane, as well as hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide. Most experts believe the carbon and hydrogen came from microscopic plants and animals deposited with mud and silt at the bottom of ancient oceans. Over millions of years, the intense pressure and heat caused by growing layers of sediment transformed this organic material into crude oil and natural gas. The sediment itself eventually became porous sedimentary rock. Oil and gas migrate upwards through this rock because they are less dense than the seawater in its pores. You would see the same result if you put a mixture of gas, oil and water in a glass: they would separate according to their different densities. If the gas manages to reach the surface, it is released into the atmosphere. But often it will be stopped in its upward journey by impermeable rock formations, or cap rocks, that trap it in underground reservoirs. 
SHIPPED Hidden a metre or more underground, a vast subterranean network of steel pipes and plastic tubes delivers natural gas from the wellhead to the consumer. Almost 80,000 km of gas pipelines link producers in the west to the populated regions of eastern Canada and the U.S. Efficient movement through the pipeline requires transmission at high pressure along the way. Propelled at speeds of up to 40 km per hour, it takes about three days for natural gas from Alberta to reach markets in southwestern Ontario. A voracious U.S. appetite for natural gas has sparked recent additions to the system, such as the $1.8-billion, 1,051-km Maritimes and Northeast pipeline that moves Sable Island gas from Nova Scotia to Dracut, Mass., and the $4.5-billion, 2,988-km Alliance pipeline that links B.C. and Alberta to the Chicago market. 
MEASURED In the metric system, joules measure energy content. The joule was named after James Joule, an English physicist who co-discovered the law of conservation of energy: ""Energy used up in one form reappears in another and is never lost."" One joule is the amount of energy required to heat one gram of water by 1/4 degree Celsius. Since joules are so small, people normally speak in terms of gigajoules, or one billion joules. An average Canadian home would use about 150 GJ in a year, and one gigajoule on a particularly cold winter day. Producers and pipeline operators measure natural gas by volume using cubic metres (or cubic feet, just to confuse the issue). One cubic metre is the size of an average dishwasher. Canada is the third-largest producer of natural gas in the world, producing 162 billion cubic metres in 1999. No. 1 is the Russian Federation (551 billion), No. 2 is the U.S. (540 billion) and No. 4 is the U.K. (100 billion). According to Oilweek magazine, the top three Canadian producers in 2000 were: Alberta Energy Company Ltd. (gas revenues of $2.3 billion), PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd. ($1.6 billion) and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. ($1.3 billion). 
DISCOVERED The first natural gas discovery in Canada was at Stoney Creek, N.B., in 1859. The first commercial development came 30 years later, when entrepreneur Eugene Coste drilled a well that supplied communities in Essex County, Ont., near Windsor. By 1904, he had moved west, making history in 1909 with ""Old Glory,"" so-called for the size of its flare, near Bow Island, Alta. This discovery was large enough to justify a 270-km-long, 40-cm-wide pipeline to Calgary, the longest of its kind at the time. 
PRICED If Canada has so much natural gas, why did prices hit an all-time high of $16.90 per gigajoule in December 2000, up from $2.63 in January 2000? Simple supply and demand, combined with a cold winter and fears of low storage levels. Since then, prices have fallen to the $4.50 range, partly due to the economic slowdown. Matthew Foss, an economist with the Canadian Energy Research Institute in Calgary, predicts an average price of $3.50 per gigajoule this winter, since storage facilities are at near capacity and new drilling is proceeding: about 13,000 gas wells by year's end.

Heating Bills This Winter to Ease Sharply Utilities: Lower natural gas prices are reducing costs for Californians, but reliance on imports could be a problem in the long run, studies say.
NANCY RIVERA BROOKS

Winter heating bills in California will be substantially smaller than the swollen tabs of last year because of sharply lower natural gas prices and plentiful supplies, utilities said Wednesday. 
But the longer-term picture for consumers is not as rosy, despite the recent decline in wholesale natural gas prices. 
Two reports released this week warn that California's heavy reliance on imported natural gas, which fuels most of the state's power plants in addition to fulfilling most of its heating needs, could be setting the state up for future energy crises. 
For now, the wholesale price of natural gas is dropping along with most fossil fuels, and supplies are plentiful. Natural gas futures slumped to a 2 1/2-year low Wednesday after an industry report showed a bigger-than-expected jump in U.S. inventories. 
The American Gas Assn. said supplies in storage rose 3.3% last week to 2.848 trillion cubic feet, continuing a steady build made possible by reduced demand from manufacturers. 
In response, natural gas for October delivery fell 9.5 cents, or 4.9%, to $1.83 per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices have dropped 82% from a Dec. 27 record of $10.10 per million BTU, caused by scant supplies. 
Prices in California, which imports 85% of its natural gas from other U.S. states and Canada, peaked much higher in December at about $60 per million BTU. California wholesale prices now are hovering close to the Nymex price. 
California was clobbered harder last winter than the rest of the country for several reasons: colder-than-usual weather, heavy use by in-state power plants and reduced pipeline capacity caused by a deadly explosion. In addition, state regulators accused a major pipeline operator, the El Paso Natural Gas unit of El Paso Corp., of manipulating the market; federal regulators have not yet ruled on that case. 
""The message this year is much better than it was at this time last year,"" said Anne Smith, vice president for customer service at Southern California Gas, a subsidiary of San Diego-based Sempra Energy. Southern California Gas' more than 5 million customers paid record prices last year, as did the customers of Sempra's San Diego Gas & Electric and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric. 
Unlike with electricity, the price of natural gas is not fixed for residential and small-business customers. The gas utilities pass along the commodity price to customers with no markup. 
Last winter, which runs from November to March in the utility world, the average residential customer of Southern California Gas got a monthly bill of $80. This winter, the average bill is expected to be about $60, Smith said. 
The basic commodity cost for natural gas sold to its residential customers for this October, for example, will be 15.9 cents per therm, compared with 57.04 cents last October. (A therm is one-tenth the standard wholesale measure of 1 million BTUs, or about 100 cubic feet of gas.) 
Transmission costs, which remain fairly constant year to year, average about 40 cents per therm for the company's residential customers. (The average single-family home uses about 75 therms a month.) 
PG&E projects similar cost declines, and both utilities say they have plenty of gas in storage to meet the needs of their core residential and small-business customers. 
But problems loom with California's natural gas supply system, according to studies released this week by the California Energy Commission and the California Public Interest Research Group. 
The two studies agree that heavy demand has strained the state's delivery and storage systems, but otherwise they had little in common. 
The final draft of the Energy Commission staff report, released Monday, noted that utilities already are moving to expand or build new pipelines, and recommended that the state encourage the drilling of more natural gas wells and expansion of pipeline systems within California, among other things. 
The CalPIRG report, released Wednesday, advocates that the state deny licenses to any new power plants fueled by natural gas and to encourage renewable energy production through favorable taxation and by requiring that a minimum of 20% of the state's electricity come from wind, solar and geothermal sources by 2010. 
""Natural gas is cleaner than other fossil fuels,"" said CalPIRG's Brad Heavner, the report's author. ""But it's not a magic bullet, and by relying on it we are setting ourselves up.""


USA: FERC OKs Tuscarora natgas pipeline for Nev, Calif.

09/26/2001 
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
WASHINGTON, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. won preliminary approval on Wednesday from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to build a pipeline to ship natural gas to local distribution companies and electric power plants in Nevada and California. 
The pipeline and related facilities would carry up to about 96 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. 
The agency must still determine the environmental impact of the pipeline before making a final decision on the project. 
Tuscarora owns an interstate natural gas pipeline system that begins at a connection with PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest Corp., located near Malin, Ore., and extending southeasterly for 229 miles to its terminus in Storey County, Nevada, at the Tracy Power Plant. The power plant is owned by Sierra Pacific Power Co., an affiliate of Tuscarora. 
Shipments in the pipeline would be phased in over a two-year period beginning in November, 2002. 
Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. is a partnership between Sierra Pacific Resources and TransCanada Pipelines Ltd.

Corporate Charges
	Tracy Geaccone has suggested (and discussed with Terry West in Corporate Planning) that the pipelines be allowed access to the 2002 Plan once it has been loaded in SAP for the Corporate cost centers that bill us. The Plan would be recorded by GL account within each of the applicable cost centers.  Corporate prepares a schedule that shows which cost centers bill us, the methodologies used and the amounts billed.  It would be quite an undertaking because of the number of Corporate cost centers involved, but each of the pipelines would be able to derive a FERC breakdown using the Plan, plus the schedule from Corporate.  The main issue would be manpower.  Tracy mentioned the possibility of having one of the associate analysts perform this task, but said that the Plan would not be finalized and loaded until probably the end of November.

	Is this an acceptable solution?  Do we need a meeting to discuss this further?  I am still waiting for return phone calls from Enron Networks and Global Finance.  There are just a few Global Finance cost centers that bill us.  However, the method proposed above may also be a solution for Enron Networks billings.


Enron Property and Services Corp.
	The mandate that these billings be recorded in individual cost centers rather than at a company level originated with Tracy Geaccone with a promise of cost savings to Stan.  However, Tracy told me that rather than coding to a cost center, she has requested that the coding be to a FAR order.  I told her that would mean multiple FAR orders.  Her thinking is that each cost center already has a FAR order.  I attempted to describe our use of custom variants.  She said that she would work through Bob Chandler.  If we intend to continue using the custom variants, it would mean creating a large number of new FAR orders.

	Again, is this an acceptable solution?  Do we need a meeting to discuss this further?

Subject:	Electronic Filing and Electronic Service (Docket RM01-11)


        I received several comments on what INGAA should file in the NOI on eService and eDistribution.  They were the same as our discussion at the Reg Policy Committee meeting -basically INGAA supports the Commission's implementing advanced electronic measures as long as they are not burdensome or costly.
        Instead of filing detailed responses to each question, I propose that we file a letter  <<Boergers ltr eService.doc>> generally supporting the Commission's proposal.  Attached is a draft letter for your comment and review.
        Please comment by COB Friday, October 19th. 
        Thank you.

"","GENERAL DEPARTMENT MESSAGE ANNOUNCING THE PAPER TIMESHEET TRANSITION TO ONLINE APPROVAL:
If you approve timesheets for Enron Temporary Workers in the administrative/clerical area, this message is for you:
Contingent Staffing Solutions (CSS), which provides centralized management for Enron's temporary staffing providers and temporary workers, announces the transition from paper timesheets to online timekeeping.
In our ongoing effort to provide greater efficiency and order accuracy to users of Enron Temporary Workers, a temporary worker for whom you must approve time will now enter time online through GRi, the CSS online application that tracks and reports temporary staffing usage. Once a temporary worker submits his or her time, e-mail is generated that is sent to you, the approver, prompting you to log onto GRi to review the electronic timesheet. 
Your logon is: TebLokey 
Password is: TLokey 
Organization ID is: 2160 
You will be prompted to change your password. 
During the transition period, you may have some temporary workers using paper timesheets and some using GRi. Soon, all paper timesheets will be phased out and all admin/clerical temporaries will report time using only GRi. 
We appreciate your cooperation and welcome your feedback during this transition. You will receive online approval instructions at the time of the order. Please contact Gwen Chavis/Liz LeGros at 713-345-6899 if you have any questions.
Please find attached training for order entry and time sheet approval.

"Message from Stan Horton - EGS Management Change","We have a great deal of work underway with our continuing operations, bankruptcy related issues, managing asset sales transitions and major operating environment issues.  While I have great confidence in our ability to overcome challenges, we will need to simultaneously direct our attention on a number of key areas to be successful.

In light of the above, I have asked Danny McCarty to take on a new role as managing director of special projects for Enron Global Services (EGS).  Danny's responsibilities will include a number of complex bankruptcy related activities, the workout of certain troubled assets and optimizing the value of selected businesses.

Until the question of our right to repurchase Northern Natural Gas is resolved, it is better to minimize organizational changes.  Consequently, I do not plan to replace Danny as managing director and chief commercial officer of Enron Transportation Services (ETS) at this time.  Steve Harris, Bob Hayes, Rob Kilmer, Shelley Corman and the business development efforts will report directly to me.

I truly appreciate Danny's willingness to take on this responsibility.  His involvement should ensure that we dedicate the necessary attention to key business issues, while allowing Jim Hughes and me to focus on the priorities of a reorganization plan and our day-to-day operations.

As always, thank you for your continued dedication and support.

Stan

"Re: *EMCA* Lawn Mowed","In addition to mowing lawns, Jim Rolewicz is a landscaper.  He's worked for several people I know, including one EMCA resident.  In addition, as his customers occasionally ask if he can do other tasks for them, he has learned more skills and is now the only handyman whose name I give out to my wallpaper customers.

Return (first class!) on Sunday, Dec. 30, at 10:50 am, change in Cleveland,

with me (you can always cancel) and return whenever. It cheers me just to
know that you'd even consider this. You need the break and I could use the

"RE: SoCalGas Developments","Yes, we should take a look at it. I spoke to Blair about it this morning but we probably need to get a more in-depth analysis. Lorraine is SoCal's rep so she should probably be the one to review it as well as Kim Watson and myself. Thanks.

Subject:	RE: SoCalGas Developments

I had also received the filing and likewise Susan (Scott) Lindberg had received one.  Susan's copy has been forwarded to Blair/Teb for regulatory review as well as being available in Houston for Marketing to review.  It's a bound document about 2 inches thick including the testimony.  Importantly it includes SoCal's proposal for receipt point capacity.  I've only read the transmittal letter thus far but will continue reviewing it for more detail.  

Steve, would you want to designate someone from Marketing to review key sections?  I would offer to let them know which areas or sections of the filing could use input from Marketing before we decide whether or not to comment on SoCal's proposal or to simply intervene at this time, monitor progress and provide input later in the proceeding if necessary. 

Other comments?  gh

"Health Insurance - 12-11-01","This is probably not anything new to some of you, but I contacted the Enron Benefits Service Center today, again, and made contact with someone almost immediately (713-332-7979).  I asked about the status of retiree health insurance benefits.  The contact person indicated that all retiree health insurance was still in force and the Service Center had not received any new information about health insurance benefits for retirees.  If you have heard anything new or different, please let me know.

The ""Frequently Asked Questions"" web site (www.enron.com/corp/alumni/faq.html) seems to be primarily pertaining to employees who have been a party to the layoffs.  There was some mention of COBRA insurance being available after December 31st, which seems, at this time, to pertain to employees involved in the layoffs.  I have submitted a question pertaining to retirees.

There are some retirees involved with the Enron Deferred Compensation plan, for which payments have now been stopped.  Forms are being mailed by Enron to those with unpaid Deferred Comp.  Such forms are to be used for filing as ""Unsecured Creditors.""  Some groups have been formed to contend with this particular situation.

Rod and Tracy,

As a result of a state of Colorado audit TW has been assessed tax (+penalties and interest) for compressor fuel use ($.4mm), and on the purchase of a La Plata facility ($1.3mm). We are protesting. However, it has been recommended, and I concur, that we pay
the compressor fuel use assessment (""under protest"") to stop interest accruals on the use tax assessment. We believe the sales tax assessment is at best -weak- and therefore do not recommend any payment.

We're requesting approval to cut a check to the Colorado Dept of Revenue for $356,736.95.  
This payment would be a deferred expense until the protest is fully resolved.

"Re: *EMCA* Neglected vacant lots - Here's my beef...","It's not about neighborhood issues, but Hilary's complaint reminded me of my
own, which is now two years old.

The police did absolutely NOTHING about a road rage incident where a big
beefy guy came out of his car (during a totally nonmoving traffic jam) and
HIT ME (I'm a little bitty female), then STOLE THE KEYS out of my ignition
and THREW THEM OVER THE EMBANKMENT into the night, then continued to
THREATEN AND HARRASS me for about  20 more minutes until we started moving
again.

We had witnesses, license number, vehicle ID, etc.  I reported it at the
substation.  Nothing.  I followed up with HPD over a period of weeks.
Nothing.  Even went downtown to their office.  Nothing.  Annise Parker even
got pissed off over the story, and tried to use her influence with the cops.
NOTHING.

""To Serve and Protect""   Yeah.  Sure.

This is really pretty funny!
  

  _____  

A Cat's Tale... 

This is the story of the night my ten-year-old cat, Rudy, got his head stuck in the garbage disposal. I  knew at the time that the experience would be funny if the cat survived, so let me tell you right up front that he's fine. 

Getting him out wasn't easy, though, and the process included numerous home remedies, a plumber, two cops, an emergency overnight veterinary clinic, a case of mistaken identity, five hours of panic, and fifteen minutes of fame. 

First, some background. My husband, Bill, and I had just returned from a five-day spring-break vacation in the Cayman Islands, where I had been sick as a dog the 
whole time, trying to convince myself that if I had to feel lousy, it was better to do it in paradise. 

We had arrived home at 9 PM, a day and a half later than we had planned because of airline problems. I still had illness-related vertigo, and because of the flight delays, had not been able to prepare the class I was supposed to teach at 8:40 the next morning. I sat down at my desk to think about William Carlos Williams, and around ten o'clock I heard Bill hollering something undecipherable from the kitchen. 

As I raced out to see what was wrong, I saw Bill frantically rooting around under the kitchen sink and Rudy, or rather, Rudy's headless body, scrambling around in the sink, his claws clicking in panic on the metal. 

Bill had just ground up the skin of some smoked salmon in the garbage disposal, and when he left the room, Rudy (whom we always did call a pinhead) had gone in 
after it. 

It is very disturbing to see the headless body of your cat in the sink. This is an animal that I have slept with nightly for ten years, who burrows under the covers and purrs against my side, and who now looked like a desperate, fur-covered turkey carcass, set to defrost in the sink while it's still alive and kicking. It was also disturbing to see Bill, Mr. Calm-in-any-Emergency, at his wits end, trying to 
soothe Rudy, trying to undo the garbage disposal, failing at both, and basically freaking out. 

Adding to the chaos was Rudy's twin brother Lowell, also upset, racing around in circles, jumping onto the kitchen counter and alternately licking Rudy's butt for comfort and biting it out of fear. Clearly, I had to do something. 

First we tried to ease Rudy out of the disposal by lubricating his head and neck. We tried Johnson's baby shampoo (kept on hand for my nieces visits) and butter-flavored Crisco: both failed, and a now-greasy Rudy kept struggling. 

Bill then decided to take apart the garbage disposal, which was a good idea, but he couldn't do it. Turns out, the thing is constructed like a metal onion: you peel off one layer and another one appears, with Rudy's head still buried deep inside, stuck in a hard plastic collar. My job during this process was to sit on the kitchen counter petting Rudy, trying to calm him, with the room spinning (vertigo), Lowell howling (he's part Siamese), and Bill clattering around with tools. 

When all our efforts failed, we sought professional help. I called our regular plumber, who actually called me back quickly, even at 11 o'clock at night (thanks, Dave). He talked Bill through further layers of disposal dismantling, but still we couldn't reach Rudy. I called the 1-800 number for Insinkerator (no response), a pest removal service that advertises 24-hour service (no response), an all-night emergency veterinary clinic (who had no experience in this matter, and so, no advice), and finally, in desperation, 911. I could see that Rudy's normally pink paw pads were turning blue. The fire department, I figured, gets cats out of trees; maybe they could get one out of a garbage disposal. 

The dispatcher had other ideas and offered to send over two policemen. This suggestion gave me pause. I'm from the sixties, and even if I am currently a fine 
upstanding citizen, I had never considered calling the cops and asking them to come to my house, on purpose.  I resisted the suggestion, but the dispatcher was 
adamant: ""They'll help you out,"" he said. 

The cops arrived close to midnight and turned out to be quite nice. More importantly, they were also able to think rationally, which we were not. 

They were, of course, quite astonished by the situation: ""I've never seen anything like this,"" Officer Mike kept saying. (The unusual circumstances helped us get quickly on a first-name basis with our cops.) 

Officer Tom expressed immediate sympathy for our plight. ""I have had cats all my life,"" he said, comfortingly. Also he had an idea. Evidently we needed a certain tool, a tiny, circular rotating saw that could cut through the heavy plastic flange encircling Rudy's neck without hurting Rudy, and Officer Tom happened to own one. ""I live just five minutes from here,"" he said; ""I'll go get it."" 

He soon returned, and the three of them, Bill and the two policemen got under the sink together to cut through the garbage disposal. I sat on the counter, holding Rudy and trying not to succumb to the surreal-ness of the scene, with the weird 
middle-of-the-night lighting, the rooms occasional spinning, Lowell's spooky sound effects, an apparently headless cat in my sink and six disembodied legs poking out from under it. One good thing came of this:  the guys did manage to get the bottom of the disposal, so we could now see Rudy's face and knew he could 
breathe. But they couldn't cut the flange without risking the cat. 

Stumped, Officer Tom had another idea. ""You know,"" he said, ""I think the reason we can't get him out is the angle of his head and body. If we could just get the 
sink out and lay it on its side, I'll bet we could slip him out."" That sounded like a good idea at this point, ANYTHING would have sounded like a good idea and as it turned out, Officer Mike runs a plumbing business on weekends; he knew how to take out the sink! Again they went to work, the three pairs of legs sticking out from under the sink surrounded by an ever-increasing pile of tools and sink parts. They cut the electrical supply, capped off the plumbing lines, unfastened the metal clamps, unscrewed all the pipes, and about an hour later, voila! The sink was lifted gently out of the countertop, with one guy holding the garbage disposal (which contained Rudy's head) up close to the sink (which contained Rudy's body). We laid the sink on its side, but even at this more favorable removal angle, Rudy stayed stuck. 

Officer Tom's radio beeped, calling him away on some kind of real police business. As he was leaving, though, he had another good idea: ""You know,"" he said, 
""I don't think we can get him out while he's struggling so much. We need to get the cat sedated. If he were limp, we could slide him out."" And off he went, regretfully, a cat lover still worried about Rudy. 

The remaining three of us decided that getting Rudy sedated was a good idea, but Bill and I were new to the area. We knew that the overnight emergency 
veterinary clinic was only a few minutes away, but we didn't know exactly how to get there. ""I know where it is!"" declared Officer Mike. ""Follow me!"" 

So Mike got into his patrol car, Bill got into the drivers seat of our car, and I got into the back, carrying the kitchen sink, what was left of the garbage disposal, and Rudy. 

It was now about 2:00 a.m. We followed Officer Mike for a few blocks when I decided to put my hand into the garbage disposal to pet Rudy's face, hoping I 
could comfort him. Instead, my sweet, gentle bedfellow chomped down on my finger, hard, really hard and wouldn't let go. My scream reflex kicked into gear, 
and I couldn't stop the noise. Bill slammed on the breaks, hollering ""What? What happened? Should I stop?"" checking us out in the rear view mirror. 

""No,"" I managed to get out between screams, ""just keep driving. Rudy's biting me, but we've got to get to the vet. Just go!"" 

Bill turned his attention back to the road, where Officer Mike took a turn we hadn't expected, and we followed. After a few minutes Rudy let go, and as I 
stopped screaming, I looked up to discover that we were wandering aimlessly through an industrial park, in and out of empty parking lots, past little streets 
that didn't look at all familiar. ""Where's he taking us?"" I asked. ""We should have been there ten minutes ago!"" 

Bill was as mystified as I was, but all we knew to do was follow the police car until, finally, he pulled into a church parking lot and we pulled up next to him. 

As Bill rolled down the window to ask Mike ""where are we going?"" the cop, who was not Mike, rolled down his window and asked, ""Why are you following me?"" Once Bill and I recovered from our shock at having tailed the wrong cop car and the policeman from his pique at being stalked, led us quickly to the emergency vet, where Mike greeted us by holding open the door, exclaiming, ""Where were you guys?"" 

It was lucky that Mike got to the vets ahead of us, because we hadn't thought to call and warn them about what was coming. (Clearly, by this time we weren't 
really thinking at all.) We brought in the kitchen sink containing Rudy and the garbage disposal containing his head, and the clinic staff was ready. They took his temperature (which was down 10-degrees) and his oxygen level (which was half of normal), and the vet declared: ""This cat is in serious shock. We've got to sedate him and get him out of there immediately."" 

When I asked if it was OK to sedate a cat in shock, the vet said grimly, ""We don't have a choice."" With that, he injected the cat; Rudy went limp; and the vet 
squeezed about half a tube of K-Y jelly onto the cat's neck and pulled him free. 

Then the whole team jumped into code blue mode. (I know this from watching a lot of ER) They laid Rudy on a cart, where one person hooked up IV fluids, another 
put little socks on his paws (""You'd be amazed how much heat they lose through their pads,"" she said), one covered him with hot water bottles and a blanket, 
and another took a blow-dryer to warm up Rudy's now very gunky head. The fur on his head dried in stiff little spikes, making him look rather pathetically punk as he lay there, limp and motionless. 

At this point they sent Bill, Mike, and me to sit in the waiting room while they tried to bring Rudy back to life. I told Mike he didn't have to stay, but he just stood there, shaking his head. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" he said again. 

At about 3 AM, the vet came in to tell us that the prognosis was good for a full recovery. They needed to keep Rudy overnight to re-hydrate him and give him 
something for the brain swelling they assumed he had, but if all went well, we could take him home the following night. 

Just in time to hear the good news, Officer Tom rushed in, finished with his real police work and concerned about Rudy. I figured that once this ordeal was over 
and Rudy was home safely, I would have to re-think my position on the police. 

Bill and I got back home about 3:30. We hadn't unpacked from our trip, I was still intermittently dizzy, and I still hadn't prepared my 8:40 class. ""I need a vacation,"" I said, and while I called the office to leave a message canceling my class, Bill 
made us a pitcher of martinis. I slept late the next day and then badgered the vet about Rudy's condition until he said that Rudy could come home later that day. 

I was working on the suitcases when the phone rang. ""Hi, this is Steve Huskey from the Norristown Times-Herald,"" a voice told me. ""Listen, I was just going through the police blotter from last night.  Mostly it's the usual stuff: Breaking and entering, petty theft but there's this one item. Um, do you have a cat?"" So I told Steve the whole story, which interested him. A couple hours later he called back to 
say that his editor was interested, too; did I have a picture of Rudy? The next day Rudy was front-page news, under the ridiculous headline Catch of the Day Lands Cat in Hot Water. 

There were some noteworthy repercussions to the newspaper article. Mr. Huskey had somehow inferred that I called 911 because I thought Bill, my husband, was going into shock, although how he concluded this from my comment that his pads were turning blue, I don't quite understand. So the first thing I had to do was call Bill at work. Bill, who had worked tirelessly to free Rudy--and swear that I had been misquoted.  When I arrived at work myself, I was famous; people had been calling my secretary all morning to inquire about Rudy's health. 

When I called our regular vet (whom I had met only once) to make a follow-up appointment for Rudy, the receptionist asked, ""Is this the famous Rudy's mother?"" When I brought my car in for routine maintenance a few days later, Dave, my mechanic, said, ""We read about your cat. Is he OK?"" When I called a tree surgeon about my dying red oak, he asked if I knew the person on that street whose cat had been in the garbage disposal. 

And when I went to get my hair cut, the shampoo person told me the funny story her grandma had read in the paper, about a cat that got stuck in the garbage 
disposal. Even today, over a year later, people ask about Rudy, whom a 9-year-old neighbor had always called the Adventure Cat because he used to climb on 
the roof of her house and peer in the second-story window at her. 

I don't know what the moral of this story is, but I do know that this adventure cost me $1100 in emergency vet bills, follow-up vet care, a new sink, new plumbing, new electrical wiring, and a new garbage disposal, one with a cover. The vet can no longer say he's seen everything but the kitchen sink. I wanted to thank Officers Tom and Mike by giving them gift certificates to the local hardware store, but was told that they couldn't accept gifts, that I would put them in a bad position if I tried. So I wrote a letter to the Police Chief praising their good deeds and sent 
individual thank-you notes to Tom and Mike, complete with pictures of Rudy, so they could see what he looks like with his head on. And Rudy, whom we originally 
got for free (or so we thought), still sleeps with me under the covers on cold nights and unaccountably, he still sometimes prowls the sink, hoping for fish...

"FW: Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles","The posting process as discussed below in Steve Kirks email is what we believe is the best way to handle the sale of any incremental Needles only capacity.  

 In regard to new generally available capacity, for example as a result of a ROFR contract not rolling over,  the capacity would be posted as generally available, and again, per the tariff we are not required to agree to amend a primary point.  We would suggest use of a posting/open season that follows the turnback capacity for sale with the parameters for bidding laid out, including the time period for which we are accepting bids.  If no acceptable bids are received, and a shipper asks to amend their primary point, the tariff provides the right to decline unless agreed.  However, if you have given a shipper the contractual right to change their primary point ie, request an available point, you will have to accept the request.   Hope this helps and concurs with our discussion today.

Subject:	Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles

Based upon our understanding of the request from TW Marketing, here is our suggested position on the posting and awarding of potential take-away capacity at SoCal Needles from approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.

TW would post on its website a notice in the capacity section that, based on information provided by SoCal regarding an expansion on their system, the take-away capacity at SoCal Needless may be increased by __Dth/day for the period of approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.  Shippers would be advised that the actual start date would depend on SoCal completing their system modifications. The posting would say that TW would accept requests for such capacity during a stated period of time (a minimum of 3 business days).  TW would award the capacity to the shipper(s) willing to provide the greatest cost commitment. The greatest cost commitment would be defined as those revenues above and beyond the current revenues which Transwestern already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.

Call me and I'll arrange for us to meet to discuss this further.   sjk

Rod and Tracy,

As a result of a state of Colorado audit TW has been assessed tax (+penalties and interest) for compressor fuel use ($.4mm), and on the purchase of a La Plata facility ($1.3mm). We are protesting. However, it has been recommended, and I concur, that we pay
the compressor fuel use assessment (""under protest"") to stop interest accruals on the use tax assessment. We believe the sales tax assessment is at best -weak- and therefore do not recommend any payment.

We're requesting approval to cut a check to the Colorado Dept of Revenue for $356,736.95.  
This payment would be a deferred expense until the protest is fully resolved.

"RE: Amending Red Rock Contracts","Tab,

I don't disagree with your comment however, my recollection is that one of the main reasons we made the decision we did was because the commercial folks didn't want to have to reopen the agreement with a rate amendment.  The concern I though was that such an overture would possibly send the wrong message to the customer or possibly create a perception that the customer had some leverage.  My question is, not that we need to amend the agreement for other reasons should we add the discounted rate... do it all at once?  Please provide your thoughts.  Thanks.  Greg

I believe this was the consensus of the attendees in both Omaha and Houston.  Steve, Greg and others attended via videoconference in Omaha.

I hate to do this, and do not want to put anyone out, but I need some help.
 
The mosquitoes are terrible.  It is hurting me to look at Kendall (my son) any more, as the number of bites on him have gone into the double digits.
 
I cannot imagine that we are the only ones suffering from these nasty little pests, and I want to do something about it.
 
If any of you have time tomorrow, can you do me this - can you call Harris County Mosquito Control and help me complain?  I figure that if a whole load of us start calling, they won't be able to ignore us.
 
Their number is 713-440-4800.  I get a recording when I call, but their hours are 8 - 5, so maybe we can talk to a live person tomorrow.
 
Thank you for helping me, and ultimately helping everyone.

But, of course, we had to use a city approved contractor and engineer. The engineer drew up plans for a line that was at least twice as long as it needed to be.

  This means that, if I hadn't noticed it, the contractor would have dug up twice as much of Bomar as he did, or, more likely, he would have charged me for the extra work without doing it, probably splitting the excess charge with the engineer and maybe the city inspector. When I pointed it out by phone to the engineer (who almost never returned calls from me or our builder) he said not to worry, that he would be here when the city inspector came and would make everything all right. A friend put me in touch with an e-mail group or small web site maintained by people who had similar problems, and emboldened by their experiences, I finally got him to make the changes by threatening to have his license and his green card revoked.

  I attribute many of our problems with city contractors and employees with a contracting and hiring policy that is more concerned with correcting social evils than getting the work done by someone who can do the best job for the lowest cost.

"FW: Attachment A - Payment Schedule","
All,

We are still working on all the details of the proposed interconnect with Questar Southern Trails in the Blanco Hub and will send you a copy soon for your review.  Since the interconnect is fully reimbursable, Questar is proposing to pay us according to the attached payment schedule vs. paying all of it up front.  

Please take a look at this attached schedule and provide me you comments.  If we allow them to pay ""along the way"" I am interested in making sure it at least matches the timing of our cash outlay of building the interconnect.  The total estimate of $702,000 includes the tax gross up, which may or may not be applicable, so each of these amount may be reduced by the tax amount.


Does anyone have any concerns with the timing of the payment schedule?  

Thanks, Kim.

Subject:	OBA & Scheduling Alt FT by Price Tariff Filings

In an effort to get cash in the door for TW and to maximize revenue opportunity for TW in the coming year, I think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the FERC as soon as possible. 

One would be the OBA filing we have been discussing (and trying to support with historical data) to get automatic cash-out on OBA's in ""constrained"" areas on TW.

Second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate FT points.  This may be the time (the market to California is not so hot) to try to implement this.  I know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them.  

Glen is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the OBA tariff filing.  Could we discuss scheduling alternate FT by price at the same meeting?

All, 

Please review the attached interconnect agreement between Transwestern and Questar.  It is fully reimbursable by Questar.  This interconnect will be a delivery point to Questar in the Blanco Hub.  FYI, the section of pipe that we are connecting the interconnect to is owned by Transwestern and is not part of the jointly owned facilities of the Blanco Hub.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me to discuss.

Please reply back to me with any comments you may have.  I would like to send a draft to Questar on Tuesday morning, January 22, when we return from our holiday. 

Bill and Robert - please see the red-lined language addressing the tax reimbursement.  

Thanks for your time,

Subject:	FW: SoCal - November 1 Changes

            We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they
	     only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can 
	     call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and 
	     Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact
	     to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

It does not address capacity or open season issues as dictated by the order.  We will investigate the filing with SoCal as to the status of addressing these issues. 

A01-10-024  SoCalGas BCAP.  In regard to filing comments on EGA's motion to strike the testimony and related materials on embedded cost-based allocation versus the long-run marginal cost methodology for the hearing on Monday, Jan. 7, 2002, it was decided not to file comments, but continue monitoring the proceeding.  By participating Transwestern will continue to have the option of addressing any of the issues raised by other parties.

CPUC Infrastructure Report.  The Commission has issued its report and assessment of the state's gas infrastructure for the three major utilities in California.  Their conclusion is that the natural gas transportation and storage systems are adequate to provide reliable amounts of competitively priced gas to residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation customers.  Therefore they recommend that the Power Authority should not finance any new natural gas projects.

"FW: Angels are ....","

Another tidbit to remind us that we see/hear Divinity all around us: 

Just remember, ""Our God is an Awesome God!"" 

READ This All the Way, and send it back please! 
This will give you the chills.....GOOD Chills! 

A young man had been to Wed. night Bible Study. The pastor had shared
about listening to God and obeying the Lord's voice. The young man
couldn't help but wonder, Does God still speak to people?"" 

After service, he went out with some friends for coffee 
and pie, and they discussed the message. Several different ones talked
about how God had led them in different ways.

It was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home.
Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, ""God...If you still speak to
people speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey."" 

As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest
thought to stop and buy a gallon of milk. He shook his head and said out
loud, ""God is that you?""  He didn't get a reply and started on toward
home. 

But again, the thought, buy a gallon of milk. The young man thought
about Samuel and how he didn't recognize the voice of God, and how
little Samuel ran to Eli. ""Okay, God, in case that is you, I will buy
the milk."" It didn't seem like too hard a test of obedience. He could
always use the milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of milk and
started off toward home. 

As he passed Seventh Street, he again felt the urge, ""Turn down that
street."" This is crazy he thought and drove on past the intersection.
Again, he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street. At the next
intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he
said out loud, ""Okay, God, I will."" 

He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop.
He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in a
semi-commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst
of neighborhoods either. The businesses were closed and most of the
houses looked dark like the people were already in bed.

Again, he sensed something, ""Go and give the milk to the people in the
house across the street."" The young man looked at the house. It was dark
and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already
asleep. He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat.
""Lord, this is insane. Those people are asleep and, if I wake them up,
they are going to be mad and I will look stupid."" 

Again, he felt like he should go and give the milk. Finally, he opened
the door.   ""Okay God, if this is you, I will go to the door and I will
give them the milk. If you want me to look like a crazy person, okay. I
want to be obedient. I guess that will count for something, but, if they
don't answer right away, I am out of here. 

He walked across the street and rang the bell. He could hear some noise
inside. A man's voice yelled out, ""Who is it? What do you want?""   Then
the door opened before the young man could get away.    The man was
standing there in his jeans and t-shirt.  He looked like he just got out
of bed. He had a strange look on his face, and he didn't seem too happy
to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. ""What is it?"" The young
man thrust out the gallon of milk. ""Here I brought this to you."" 

The man took the milk and rushed down a hallway, speaking loudly in
Spanish. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the milk toward
the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was
crying. The man had tears streaming down his face. The man began
speaking and half-crying, ""We were just praying. We had some big bills
this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any milk for our
baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some
milk."" 

His wife in the kitchen yelled out, ""I ask him to send an Angel with
some. Are you an Angel?""

The young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he
had on him and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward
his car and the tears were streaming down his face.   He knew that God
still answers prayers. 

This is a simple test... 

If you believe that God is alive and well, send this to at least ten
people and the person that sent it to you!

"New Legal Team to Assist RAC","	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

"RE: Columbia Gulf order on negotiated rates","I think we ought to discuss the Order with Columbia Gulf.  Its possible we are ok.  The problem FERC seems to have is that under the negotiated contract it is impossible for anyone but Columbia and the Shipper to know what the rate is at the time of the transaction.  Columbia's deal contains a default rate (based on index differentials) applicable if the parties are unable to agree on a basis price used to determine the ""Negotiated Daily Reservation Charge"".   To avoid the application of the default rate, the ""Negotiated Daily Reservation Charge"" requires Columbia and the shipper to negotiate, and agree,  to a basis number on a daily basis.  The parties did not specify particular index's for the purpose of calculating basis.  Thus, under Columbia's deal only the default rate can be determined at the time of the transaction.  In contrast, Transwestern's deals appear to be similar to Columbia's default rate; i.e., a rate based upon index's where the index's are agreed upon and stated upfront.  Thanks.  Greg

Subject:	Columbia Gulf order on negotiated rates

I received a copy of an order issued by the FERc on Columbia negotiated rate transaction, which includes a formula ie indexed rate.  They accepted the negotiated rate deal but they are requiring  them to file in their tariff within ONE DAY after the rate has been determined the contract and actual rate. ( Each time the actual rate changes during the term)   Just think about this for the upcoming TW_ USGT deal and NNG""- Reliant deals.    Notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing, the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day---  I believe this is FERC's way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals-  they are punishing themselves as well, as each filing will require a notice etc-  so every day they could need to issue an order.   

I feel we need to discuss with Columbia, INGAA and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare.  An alternative would be to require you to post on Internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate, so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate.  I'm sending you guys a copy of the order.

Subject:	RE: TW Overhead WO

We can charge directly but still need some guidance.  For example, it is my understanding that there are 4 WO set up for Red Rock - one for each station to be modified.  Our work is of a general nature, so do we have to further subdivide our charges to each of the stations, or to three of the stations.  Also, some of our time is spent on a general analysis of regulatory strategy involving all capital projects, and it seems like the overhead WO would be appropriate for these charges.  We don't necessarily want to have to have each person charge to 3 or 4 WO for each identifiable capital project and then to 10 or more WO for our general work.  Any specific suggestions, WO numbers, etc. ?

The TW commercial and regulatory team are charging to the TW overhead WO for their time related to TW projects including Red Rock.  Is this how you think we should be handling?

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron. 
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me."" 
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started. 
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985. 
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 
You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.
""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.
""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""

I hate to do this, and do not want to put anyone out, but I need some help.
 
The mosquitoes are terrible.  It is hurting me to look at Kendall (my son) any more, as the number of bites on him have gone into the double digits.
 
I cannot imagine that we are the only ones suffering from these nasty little pests, and I want to do something about it.
 
If any of you have time tomorrow, can you do me this - can you call Harris County Mosquito Control and help me complain?  I figure that if a whole load of us start calling, they won't be able to ignore us.
 
Their number is 713-440-4800.  I get a recording when I call, but their hours are 8 - 5, so maybe we can talk to a live person tomorrow.
 
Thank you for helping me, and ultimately helping everyone.
