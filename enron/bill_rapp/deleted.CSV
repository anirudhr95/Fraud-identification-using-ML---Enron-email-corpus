"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

<br>
Too Good
<br>
<br>
Don't feel bad about feeling full this Thanksgiving.
<br><br>
A recent study revealed that practicing a high level of <br>dietary restraint, such as never allowing yourself to become <br>full when you eat, may lower bone mineral content over time. <br>Of course, this doesn't give you license to stuff yourself, <br>
but you don't have to habitually go ""underboard"" either to <br>
stay in good health.<br>
<br>
RealAge Benefit: Getting the proper amount of calcium and <br>vitamin D daily can make your RealAge as much as 1.1 years <br>younger.

Investment ideas 
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
Advent Software (ADVS)
What can you say about a tech stock that analysts tout even while estimates 
drop? How about: Nice!

By Marc Gerstein
   
Usually analysts like stocks when earnings are growing, and they are most 
bullish on shares of companies whose earnings growth is especially strong. 
That's a major reason why tech stocks have been in the doghouse lately. 
Earnings have been heading south. Whether or not you want to invest in tech 
now generally depends on how patient you are. If you're willing to get in early and 
wait until earnings recover and estimates get revised upward (something that will 
probably be occurring around mid-2002), this is a great time to jump in. If you're 
not so patient, you have to agonize trying to guess the timing of recovery.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
From Russia with love
A troika of telecom stocks that are well-positioned for current trends and gaining 
analyst esteem.

by Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

When shares of Russian-based telecom companies start earning a measure of 
analyst esteem, savvy investors owe it to themselves to take a further look.

To be sure, these three Russian telcos haven't yet attained analysts' highest 
rating, but quite surprisingly--and seemingly out of nowhere--each has an 
average rating better than a neutral 3, and one of them has moved up to an 
average rating of 2 (""buy""). What gives?

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

The Wall Street Alert - Special Investment Report - LQDX
   Smart investors understand that companies with 
government and military applications are especially 
attractive in times of global instability.
   Our current recommendation, LIQUIDIX, INC. of Arizona 
(OTC BB: LQDX), has positioned itself as the leading 
competitor in the high-tech industrial manufacturing 
industry with its customizable array of magnetic fluid 
vacuum seals.
   NASA, Honeywell, ADM, Intel, have already used the 
vacuum seals created by Liquidix. These products benefit 
such important technologies as navigational gyros, 
infrared detectors, heat-seeking missiles, laser sighting 
and night-vision equipment.
   Liquidix has signed contracts with several 
Military/Government Agencies and U.S. National 
Laboratories, including NASA, which have produced 
significant growth in the company.
   Liquidix is one of only three companies in the world to 
produce magnetic fluid vacuum seals and it's the only one 
that is traded publicly in the United States. Because 
costs in this industry are very similar between companies, 
Liquidix has studied and surpassed its competition in 
delivery time. Liquidix can deliver the same product to 
its destination in 1/4 the time of its nearest competitor, 
making them especially desirable for companies who must 
meet an increasing demand for magnetic fluid vacuum seals.   
Liquidix has conservatively estimated that their gross 
revenues for 2002 will increase more than 40% over 2001, 
and by 2003 will increase another 110%. Through strategic 
mergers and acquisitions Liquidix also estimates that 
their profit margins for 2002 will increase by 60% over 
2001, and by 2003 will increase another 200%.

REASONS TO OWN THE STOCK
  1. Liquidix provides magnetic fluid vacuum seals for 
government and military applications that are in higher 
demand due to increasing military activity in the U.S.
  2. Liquidix, through strategic alliances and 
acquisitions, has established itself as the leader of an 
industry that is projected to earn more than $4.5 billion 
dollars by 2002.
  3. Liquidix provides products to industry giants such as 
NASA, HONEYWELL, INTEL, and ADM, virtually guaranteeing 
the growth of this strong company.
  4. Liquidix aggressive and strategic acquisition of 
companies like Advanced Fluid Systems demonstrates a 
strong vision for the future and positions them as a world 
leader in magnetic fluid technology.
  5. Liquidix is one of only three companies in the world 
to produce magnetic fluid vacuum seals and it is the only 
one that is traded publicly in the U.S.
  6. Facilities owned and operated by Liquidix in the 
United States and Europe have given the company a foothold 
on both sides of the Atlantic, with opportunities to break 
into additional international markets.

<br>
RealAge Cost: Taking too many medications or taking them <br>improperly can make your RealAge as much as 4.5 years older.

								Trading in your saltshaker for a bottle of soy sauce may help reduce your risk of blood clots.
<p>
A recent study revealed that soy sauce contains antiplatelet compounds that may help thin the blood. This, in turn, could help reduce the risk of clotting and stroke. Just remember, however, that soy sauce is high in sodium. If you choose soy sauce to season your food, use it sparingly, just as you would table salt.

"Organizational Changes","Re: Organizational Changes

Over the last several quarters, EES has successfully implemented a number of new business models, organizational structures and processes.  The result has been tremendous customer contracting in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe in 2001.  In all cases, EES's large consumer market share has expanded and we have rapidly increased our market penetration in the small consumer market - Enron Direct.  This effort, in itself is impressive, especially given that at the same time, EES has had to significantly restructure and re-tool its execution capabilities, systems and mid and back offices.  I can assure you that these processes, systems and capabilities are improving.  This is only the result of a lot of hard work from back to front across EES, EES risk and Enron Networks.

In that light, I am pleased to announce a number of organizational changes which demonstrate our continued commitment to the European market and the creation of a new exciting channel in the Enron Direct USA business.

A)	EES Europe:

Effective immediately, Sean Holmes will be moving to London to manage EES Europe.  We believe that Sean has the broad based experience in the EES business model, products, retail energy risk management and demand side management to take the European business to next level. Charlie Crossley-Cooke will manage our small consumer (Enron Direct) franchise.  This franchise has continued to grow, in the UK and on the continent, and has provided significant income to EES in 2001. Enron Direct will also continue to provide mid and back office services to EES Europe. Paul Turner will manage our large consumer business in Western Europe.  Paul will be replacing Stuart Rexrode who will be returning to EES in Houston.  Over the last few quarters, our penetration of this market, primarily in the UK, has grown dramatically with completed contracts with Sainsbury, Guiness, Kraft and Pirelli.  Many of these transactions include gas, power and demand side management.  We would like to thank Stuart for all his hard work toward the continued growth of the European franchise.

We are also pleased to announce the formation of the European Product Group led by Roy Poyntz.  This group will lead the development of new products and services for both the large and small consumer markets.  As in North America, its main role will be to ensure viable and innovative products are continually available in the pipeline to ensure the continued growth of the European business. The Product Group will also ensure product diversity between gas, power and energy efficiency products.  We continue to be committed to the development of the demand side management aspects of our business to differentiate us from our competitors. On a final note, the EES Europe commodity structuring and DSM groups will now report to Sean in addition to Charlie, Paul and Roy. 

As part of this change, Deb Merrill will be assuming the lead role in Deal Management in EES USA replacing Sean.  Deb has been an integral part of EES from many years and we believe she has all the experience and skill sets to effectively manage and build on this integral function in EES USA.

B)	Enron Direct USA - Dealer Network

Effective immediately, Stuart Rexrode will manage this new sales channel inside Enron Direct USA.  Stuart will be building this new more sophisticated agent selling channel by creating franchise like relationships with numerous ""dealers"" across the US.  This dealer network will consist of small knowledgeable entrepreneurs and consultants that have been in the energy markets for many years and have great regional expertise and customer relationships. EES will provide a franchise like program where we provide resources and products to this agent base in exchange for exclusive provision of sales services and customer aggregation.  We hope that this network can provide the customer acquisition velocity and low cost acquisition model benefits of the mass market agents but provide a more sophisticated agent in front of larger clients in order to sell higher value products that include gas, power and DSM.  Phyllis Anzalone and her team are already working on the development of this dealer network and will become part of this group reporting to Stuart.  Phyllis and her team deserve a lot of credit for the identification and build out to date of this newest business model in EES.

In conclusion, everyday we are getting better and more effective.  We should be very pleased with the financial and operating performance of EES for 2001.  We have an EBIT target of $75 million for Q4 which is only $4 million higher than Q3, We will finish the year at approximately $247 million.  This is approximately 10% over 2001 plan and 120% growth in recurring earnings year on year.  The business model is working and we are one step closer to the goal of becoming the leading global energy retailer.  The All-Employee meeting will be on November 1 where we look forward to discussing with you our operational and financial results for 2001 and our plan, strategies and objectives for 2002.

Investment ideas 
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Broadband providers hit the canvas
DSL has fumbled the ball and cable has hit the deck, but the ref 
hasn't counted them out...yet

By Ben Macklin, senior analyst, eMarketer

It has been a tough year for broadband access providers in the US.  
On the digital subscriber line (DSL) front, wholesalers Rhythms 
Net Connections (RTHMQ), North Point and Covad 
(COVD.OB) hit the canvas.  Covad is in the process of getting 
back on its feet, but its future remains uncertain.  On the cable side, 
Excite@Home recently filed for bankruptcy, and numerous 
broadband wireless providers including Winstar and Metricom 
have also dissolved.  But what lies ahead for those that survive?

While DSL technology has fumbled the ball early in the game and 
is now unlikely to ever live up to its promise, cable and satellite 
providers still have a chance to run for daylight. But for the time 
being, dial-up remains the clear market leader.

Indeed, eMarketer predicts continuing growth in the dial-up sector, 
at least for 2002, even though broadband services will become 
more widespread. Dial-up will taper off in the following years, but 
it will still be the most common means of Internet access in the 
home even as late as 2004.  AOL, with its 26 million subscribers 
(not counting Road Runner) as of September 2001, will continue to 
dominate the scene. Its nearest competitors, MSN (7 million 
subscribers), United Online (6.1 million subscribers) and 
Earthlink (ELNK) (4.9 million subscribers) will battle it out for 
second place.  Even if the largest five ISPs after AOL merged, they 
would still fail to rival AOL Time Warner (AOL).

"Feel Good Sale On Vintage Covers","Dear Cartoon Bank Member,

I'm going to take 20% off the price of our New Yorker Vintage Cover prints, 
and here's why:

When I woke up this morning, the sun was shining and there was no 
suspicious-looking powder in my mail.

So I threw away my hazmat suit (which had just come back from the cleaners) 
and started to think that things were getting back to normal even if it was 
a ""new normal"" on its way to becoming an old normal once an even newer 
normal came along.

All this put me in a good mood and now I want to put you in a good mood too.

So throw away your hazmat suit and check out our new Vintage Cover 
Collection online at http://www.cartoonbank.com/covers_1.asp.

You can buy our cover prints framed and matted or just matted (but the 
framed versions are really spectacular and with 20% off, a super great deal.)

Unfortunately, the Pilgrims couldn't buy these unique artistic 
reproductions.  They had to hang colored corn on their walls.

But with our new Vintage Cover collection, you can save the corn for the 
table.

Decorate with cover prints instead.

Visit our site at www.cartoonbank.com.  Our on-line display features a 
popular selection of New Yorker covers from 1925 to 1992.  Some are moody 
and artistic, others are whimsical, even hilarious.  All are perfect moments 
in time.

If you don't see the cover or artist you want, give us a call at 
1-800-897-8666 and we'll search our office database.  While not all covers 
are available, most are.    And with hundreds to choose from, I'm confident 
we can find one that will make you feel as good as I'm feeling right now!

Happy Thanksgiving to you and the family.

Normally yours,

Bob

P.S.  I went to visit my 94-year-old mother the other day.  I told her that 
her beloved granddaughter has a new pony.  ""Pony!  What does she need that 
for!"" she snorted. ""I prefer live humans.""  And that's the beauty of The 
Cartoon Bank's Vintage Cover Collection! You can get a beautiful artistic 
print of a pony or of humans! So what could be bad?



To be removed from our mailing list, mailto:removals@cartoonbank.com with 
""remove"" in the subject field. Please make sure your email uses the same 
email address with which you registered!
Thank you for your interest.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

<b>Tip of the Day</b>
<br>
Driving You Crazy
<br>
<br>
Are you hitting the road for the New Year's holiday? Do your <br>
health a favor and leave aggressive driving habits at home.
<br><br>
A recent study has revealed that people who are in the habit<br>
of driving aggressively may exhibit greater physiological<br>
sensitivity to driving stresses compared to people who don't<br>
drive aggressively. In the study, aggressive drivers tended<br>
to have tenser muscles and higher blood pressure when<br>
exposed to simulated driving tasks.
<br>
<br>
RealAge Benefit: Taking proper precautions when driving<br>
can make your RealAge as much as 3.4 years younger.

At one point, we considered using a bill management agreement for Consolidated Container. I worked on this with Erin Stus. We came up with a draft that I was fairly happy with and it should be the latest draft under my Consolidated Container file on the j drive. If you can't find it there, give Erin a call. She should still have a copy.

Are you the original owner of that laptop or is it a redeployed sysem?  Also, what model?

Subject:	RE: Laptop accessories

Not knowing exactly what model Compaq laptop Bill has makes this an educated guess on my part.  First of all, all new laptops came with both CD and floppy drives so if he is the orginal owner have him check in the bag.  If it was a redeployed system he may not have received all the pieces.  With that said, an internal floppy drive will run about $75 for the Compaq M700 laptop. Other models may vary in price a bit but probably not by much.

Bill Rapp's laptop (Compaq) is not equipped with the device that allows a 3.5"" diskette to be loaded.  He can run CDs, but not diskettes.  What do we need to order and how much will it cost?  Thanks.

Clock Beater
<br>
<br>
Looking for a health habit that turns back the clock? Recent <br>research reveals that exercise may literally wipe away years <br>of aging.
<br><br>
In the study, a small group of middle-aged men who undertook<br>
a 6-month program of moderate exercise regained the level<br>
of cardiovascular fitness they had enjoyed as healthy <br>
20-year-olds at the beginning of the study. The exercise <br>program reduced their heart rates and improved the ability <br>of their bodies to use oxygen.
<br>
<br>
RealAge Benefit: Exercising regularly can make your RealAge <br>as much as 9 years younger.

								Are you looking for a health habit that turns back the clock? Recent research reveals that exercise may literally wipe away years of aging.
<p>
In the study, a small group of middle-aged men who undertook a 6-month program of moderate exercise regained the level of cardiovascular fitness they had enjoyed as healthy 20-year-olds at the beginning of the study. The exercise program reduced their heart rates and improved the ability of their bodies to use oxygen.

							<br>
								RealAge Benefit: Exercising regularly can make your RealAge as much as 9 years younger.

<b>Tip of the Day</b>
<br>
Red Heads
<br>
<br>
You can make a more nutritious salad by sprinkling in<br>some red cabbage.
<br><br>
One cup of chopped red cabbage will add about 50 <br>milligrams of vitamin C to your salad, and will add fiber, <br>folate, and potassium, as well. What's more, some studies have <br>revealed that a high intake of cruciferous veggies such as <br>cabbage may be protective against certain kinds of cancer, <br>including bladder and breast cancer.<br>
<br>
RealAge Benefit: Eating a diverse diet that includes <br>5 servings of vegetables per day can make your RealAge <br>as much as 4 years younger.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Press Release
SOURCE: Dynegy
Dynegy Issues Statement On Enron Merger Status
HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 21, 2001--Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN - news) Chairman and CEO Chuck Watson today said he is encouraged by 
Enron Corp.'s report this morning that it has closed the remaining $450 million credit facility secured by the assets of Northern Natural Gas Pipeline and 
has received a commitment from its lead bank to extend the $690 million note payable obligation described in Enron's recent 10-Q filing. 

``We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance
 with the previously announced agreement,'' he said. 

Watson also noted that ChevronTexaco recently reiterated that it has ``full confidence in Dynegy's disciplined management approach to complete the 
merger and to build a new company into an industry leader.'' ChevronTexaco owns 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. 

Dynegy Inc. is one of the world's top energy merchants. Through its global energy delivery network and marketing, trading and risk management 
capabilities, Dynegy provides innovative solutions to customers in North America, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. 

Certain statements included in this news release are intended as ``forward-looking statements'' under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
These statements include assumptions, expectations, predictions, intentions or beliefs about future events. Dynegy cautions that actual future results may 
vary materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. Some of the key factors that could cause actual results to vary from 
those Dynegy expects include changes in commodity prices for energy or communications products or services; the timing and extent of deregulation of 
energy markets in the U.S. and Europe; the timing of required approvals for the Dynegy/Enron merger and the success of integration and cost savings 
measures relating to the merger; the effectiveness of Dynegy's risk management policies and procedures and the creditworthiness of customers and 
counterparties; the liquidity and competitiveness of wholesale trading markets for energy commodities, including the impact of electronic or online 
trading in these markets; operational factors affecting Dynegy's power generation or Dynegy's midstream natural gas facilities; uncertainties regarding 
the development of, and competition within, the market for communications services in the U.S. and Europe; uncertainties regarding environmental 
regulations or litigation and other legal or regulatory developments affecting Dynegy's business; general political, economic and financial market 
conditions; and any extended period of war or conflict involving the United States or Europe. Moreover, Dynegy's expectation that the acquisition will 
be accretive to earnings in 2002 and beyond is based upon achieving certain sales projections, meeting certain cost targets and successfully integrating
the acquired assets. More information about the risks and uncertainties relating to these forward-looking statements are found in Dynegy's SEC filings, 
which are available free of charge on the SEC's Web site at http://www.sec.gov.

Investment ideas 
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Gone digital
Companies with digital in their names seem to be on a roll.

By Dave Sterman

Whats in a name? Plenty, if youre talking about the word ""digital."" 
Screening for fast-growing Net stocks, we found that three of them use 
that ubiquitous moniker in their title. Recently, we chronicled the bright 
prospects for Digital Insight (DGIN).

This week, were looking at the other digitals, and found a pretty 
ompelling investment case for each of those as well. Both DigitalThink 
(DTHK) and Digital River (DRIV) are taking advantage of the unique selling 
properties associated with the Web.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Charge!!!
Consumers came to the rescue of retailers, and individual investors 
will come to the rescue of the street.

by Charles Payne, founder, chief executive officer and principal analyst, Wall 
Street Strategies

Last week saw a marked contrast to the previous week as the Northern Alliance 
went from the Keystone Cops to a liberating rebel force, pushing the Taliban 
back on their heels (or on their toes, as they scatter to caves and tunnels in 
the southern part of Afghanistan). Wall Street mavens and the media suggested 
that stocks were pushed higher by the war victories, and while I agree that 
the prospect of a short war is a positive element for the market, I believe 
that the week's success had some domestic ingredients as well. In fact, I think 
the most telling moment of the week came when retail sales figures were released 
last Wednesday, once again beating expectations. 

In the previous week, many observers were surprised to see that consumer 
sentiment (as monitored by the Michigan survey) came in well above estimates, 
and was quickly dismissed as some type of fluke. After last week, though, I 
dont think anyone can question the resolve of the American consumer.

High Hopes
<br>
<br>
If you're trying to lose weight or recover from illness, having <br>high expectations may help you get the results you want.
<br><br>
A recent review of medical literature revealed that <br>
patients who have positive expectations tend to fare better <br>
than patients who are less hopeful about reaching their goals.<br>
Researchers speculate that positive expectations may trigger <br>
a physical healing response as well as motivate patients to <br>
stick with prescribed therapies.

EES Keeps the Fire Burning

EES Q4 Deals: EES is pounding the pavement, making calls and (of course) making deals. The Third Party Sales Group continues to dominate the small business market in Texas, New York and Massachusetts, currently signing over 2000 new deals each week. Texas, which is known for doing everything in a big way, accounts for about 60 percent of the new deals signed. With success in the three markets already achieved, the Third Party Sales Group has moved into new territory, the Illinois market. The Third Party Sales Group, which was established less than five months ago, has already signed up more than 24,000 customers.

The Mid Market group is also bringing new customers into the fold. In these first few weeks of Q4, the Mid Market group has added Boston Market and Holiday Inn in New York, Moody Gardens and American National Insurance Company in Galveston, the Jewish Community Center Houston, Gulf Coast Retailers Association, El Fenix Restaurants in Dallas and Maxim. 
 
The commercial, manufacturing/industrial and regional commodity groups are continuing to offer EES' products and services to large business consumers and have successfully brought in several large deals over the past few weeks. New customers include Sonoco, Wendy's, Unilever and Sara Lee with gas contracts and Ball Corp, Oil Tanking and Sysco with power contracts in Texas. 

Customer Information and Support: Prior to and following Enron's merger with Dynegy, customers have expressed many questions about EES and where we stand on our contracts. A letter along with a Q&A about EES' position was distributed to customers on November 14 outlining our continued commitment to our contracts and our ongoing efforts to provide excellent customer support. Click here  to read the letter and Q&A sheet.

The Dynegy/Enron Merger
Dynegy and Enron Merger: On November 9, Dynegy and Enron announced an agreement for a merger between the two companies which is expected to confirm the value of Enron's core business, rebuild customer, counter party and investor confidence and strengthen Enron's liquidity. Of the potential options considered outside of a merger, few could provide ""the earnings potential and immediate synergies"" that a combination with Dynegy could provide according to Greg Whalley, Enron president and chief operating officer. 

The new organization will focus on core businesses including wholesale energy markets and commercial and industrial energy users. Enron will continue to act as an independent company until the merger, which is expected to close at the end of Q3 2002, is complete. Click here  to view the press release outlining the merger details and the merger Q&A.

Enron Investor Update Conference Call: Enron held an investor conference call early Thursday morning to provide investors with an up to date overview of the company's current situation. During the call, Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive officer of Enron, reviewed occurrences which led to the current loss in investor confidence and decline in liquidity such as bad investments, ""perceived"" conflicts of interest in related-party transactions, lack of transparency and errors in financial statements. ""We fully understand and regret the combination of events that have resulted in loss of investor confidence,"" said Lay, and we ""are fully committed to fixing the problems."" 

In an effort to restore operational and financial momentum, Enron will be split into Core and Non-Core businesses and Businesses Under Review. 
?	The core businesses which were performing at all time highs prior to the events that lead to the merger with    	Dynegy provide ""significant earnings and cash flow opportunities with unique competitive advantages,"" 		according to Greg Whalley, president and chief operating officer. Core businesses include the natural gas 		pipeline business, and the gas and power, retail and coal busniesses in North America and Europe.
?	Non-core businesses such as broadband and Azurix will be divested and the earnings will be used to repay 		debt and reinvest in core businesses. 
?	Businesses Under Review are potential future markets outside of power and gas wholesale businesses. 
 
The conference call is separated into five sections: Introduction, Business Overview, Business Segment Update, Financial Review and Outlook and Q&A session for easy access to needed information. Click here  to listen to the conference call.

Dynegy and Enron Investor Conference Call: In Monday morning's conference call, Dynegy and Enron executives reviewed the merger details and fielded questions from investors. Chuck Watson, Dynegy chairman and chief executive officer, reiterated the strength of Enron's core business units and the high level of integrity of the people working in the trenches. Watson and Ken Lay also spoke of the advantages that Enron's business units would bring to the new organization with Watson making specific note of EES. ""EES is three to five years ahead of Dynegy's retail unit"" and is an ""earnings contributor and growth engine that will continue in the combined company"" according to Watson. The conference call replay will be available until 5:00 p.m. EST, Monday, November 26. Click here  to listen to the conference call.

Conference Call Slide Show: If you don't have time to listen to the conference, the slideshow presentation is also available. Click here  to view the presentation.

Enron Elects New Treasurer: Raymond M. Bowen, Jr., the former chief operating officer of Enron Industrial Markets, has been elected as the new executive vice president - finance and treasurer. ""Ray has extremely good credibility with the investment community,"" according to Ken Lay and is ""well respected and trusted by banks and other financial institutions.""

Associated Press Writer

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - Concerns about Enron Corp.'s ability to weather its spiraling financial problems sent the company's stock down nearly 23 percent to its lowest level in nearly 10 years. 
The shares on Tuesday tumbled dlrs 2.07 to dlrs 6.99 on the New York Stock Exchange - the lowest since the shares closed at dlrs 7.72 in Feb. 6, 1992 - a day after the company disclosed that it might have to pay a dlrs 690 million debt by next week and amid reports that energy companies weren't selling it power and natural gas for fear they won't be paid.
Analysts were mixed on whether Enron can survive its latest financial storm and if the dlrs 10.5 billion merger between Enron and its rival Dynegy Inc. - expected to conclude by next summer - will fall apart. 
Andre Meade, head of the U.S. Utility Research for Commerzbank Securities, said he doesn't know if Dynegy is willing to take on Enron's headaches if the value of its core business - energy trading - is reduced or collapses. 
""The bid by Dynegy gave (Enron) breathing space but it did not solve all their problems,"" Meade said. 
But Duane Grubert, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein and Co., said, ""Dynegy will do what it needs to make sure the deal will prevail, which still looks attractive to them."" 
Officials with Enron and Dynegy, both Houston-based, said reports of problems with energy trading were incorrect and the merger was not in trouble. 
John Sousa, Dynegy spokesman, said Dynegy will stick with its dlrs 8.7 billion buyout plan. 
""We continue to do business with Enron. We are one of their largest customers and they are one of our largest customers,"" Sousa said. 
Late Monday, Enron filed restated third-quarter earnings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that increased its loss for the period by 3 cents a share to 87 cents. 
The company also disclosed it is trying to restructure a dlrs 690 million obligation that could come due Nov. 27. 
Adding to Enron's financial woes are reports by Dow Jones News Service that for several weeks, companies have limited buying and selling future deliveries of power and natural gas for fear they won't be paid. That could leave Enron unable to do business. 
""It's obvious that they remain in a pretty precarious position and things have evolved in a declining and worsening path,"" said Charlie Sanchez, energy markets manager for Gelber & Associates, a Houston-based energy trading firm. ""I think that there is little in terms of what could renew confidence in any trading."" 
Enron spokesman Karen Denne said reports that Enron was having trouble buying from energy traders were ""erroneous."" 
""We've seen no recognizable change in the number of customers,"" she said. ""Our transaction volume is within the normal range."" 
Denne said the company has received verbal indications it will be given more time to pay off the dlrs 690 million debt that could be due next week. 
Standard & Poor's Corp. on Tuesday said it continued to monitor Enron's credit rating for possible downgrade, which would put Enron's debt in ""junk"" status territory, making it harder and more expensive to borrow money.

								Given the recent headlines regarding anthrax infection, is it a good idea to take antibiotics just in case? Officials say no.
<p>
The FDA is discouraging people from taking antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin as a prophylactic measure. Taking antibiotics without proper diagnosis of a condition could speed the development of antibiotic-resistant forms of infection, as well as put a strain on supplies.

Investment ideas 
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Mobile phone makers eye wireless Internet opportunity
Companies look past current troubles toward growing the mobile data market

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Worsening economic conditions have caused a major strategic shift in the mobile 
handset industry. The segments top companies have begun to de-emphasize phone 
sales and are eyeing the wireless Internet as a key driver of future revenues.

Its no surprise given recent industry performance. Third quarter handset shipments 
were down by 10% over last year. Motorolas (MOT) sales fell by 22% in the quarter, 
and Ericssons (ERICY) phone operations have been so damaging to its bottom line 
that the company finally moved them into a joint venture with Sony (SNE).

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Angelic missions rising
As VC funding slows, angel investors find new wings.

By Carla Drysdale

As the country struggles to its feet after the crash of the new economy, 
exacerbated by the Sept. 11th attacks on the WTC, angel investors have 
been doing their part to help by continuing to provide seed money to startups. 

Angels, entrepreneurs-turned-investors, first earned this moniker during 
depression-era New York by bailing out ailing Broadway theatre companies. 
Since then, angel investments, along with those of venture capitalists, have 
expanded from Broadway to the Internet and beyond. Now, because traditional 
VCs are slowing the pace of investments, angels have new opportunities to 
swoop down to fill in the seed-stage gap.

<b>Tip of the Day</b>
<br>
Nix Nausea
<br>
<br>
Do you occasionally suffer from a queasy stomach? There<br>may be a quick and inexpensive way to get relief.
<br><br>
A recent study revealed that acupressure may help relieve <br>
nausea. In the study, pregnant women experiencing morning <br>
sickness wore acupressure bands on an area of the forearm <br>
just above the wrist, which is thought to relieve nausea when<br>
stimulated. After one day of wearing the bands, the majority<br>
of the women experienced significant relief from their symptoms.<br>
<br>

The amendment that I think you're referring to was not signed. We sent it to Starwood and then nothing happened. If you can't find a hard copy, you can call Rell Tipton at V&E and ask him to e-mail you the latest version of the Starwood amendment that he's been working on. If you can't reach Rell, his assistant, Birdie Cortinas can probably help. Rell's number is (713)758-4506. Hope this helps.

Hi, Bill.  Sorry to bother you again.  I found four original amendments in Travis' office, but what I am looking for is the Amendment to the CMA that pertains to the Offer Period.  Do you recall the one I am talking about?  Did it ever get signed?  

Thanks,

Investment ideas 
-----------------------------------------


1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Beware the ghosts of Christmas 2001
Spirits are hanging over the markets, not all of 
which promise happy returns.

By Rick Wayman, CFA

The market will face some difficult challenges during the next two 
quarters, and investors need to be aware of these issues in order to 
invest wisely. So, in the spirit of the coming season, and with 
apologies to Charles Dickens, I would like to introduce you to 
these challenges as the ghosts of Christmas--Version 2001. 

Our main theme is that the economy is not as good as the market 
currently thinks it is, and that earnings will come under increased 
pressure by issues that have not yet appeared on the Streets radar. 
The combination of these forces could depress stocks near-term, 
but could also result in a classic January rally.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Value without tears
Those who follow our value-oriented screens know that 
value investors don't just wind up buying dogs. 

By Marc Gerstein

All investors risk getting involved with dogs every day. But value 
investors need to be especially sensitive to the matter, since they 
make a regular practice of searching for stocks that look attractive 
based on some simple arithmetic that any investor can do, and on 
answers that anyone can see. If you're searching for value, you 
almost have to presume that anything you uncover is a dog until 
you receive specific evidence showing otherwise.

								Do you want to get as much vitamin C from your frozen veggies as possible? Use a stainless steel pan when you heat them.
<p>
Cooking vegetables usually results in at least some destruction of vitamin C. However, one study revealed that vegetables that were boiled in a stainless steel pan retained more of their vitamin C than vegetables that were boiled in a non-stick pan or a glass dish on the stove top.

Investment ideas 
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Can equipment makers overcome a capex slowdown in 2002?
Analysts believe that a few stocks are worth buying despite continued belt 
tightening.

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

The 2002 capex picture for large carriers is coming into focus, and it isn't 
pretty. The push to control spending will continue, and capex budgets look 
to be slashed by an average of 25 percent next year.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Better safe than sorry
In an insecure world, Corporate America is investing in security software

By Carla Drysdale

If you're like me, a ""virus warning"" in your email inbox isn't likely to faze you. 
You click on it and glance through it, with a vague sense of gratitude that 
the warning will hopefully prevent your computer from imploding. 

So at first I took it in stride when I received a message saying: ""If you receive 
an email entitled 'Bad Times,' delete it IMMEDIATELY. Apparently this one is 
pretty nasty."" 

I thought, okay, and I kept reading. ""It will not only erase everything on your 
hard drive, but it will also delete anything on disks within 20 feet of your 
computer...It will do all your drugs and drink all your liquor."" Now that's a nasty 
virus! While this science fiction scenario might have been written by someone 
who's seen The Matrix once too often, it is a tongue-in-cheek reminder that smart 
hackers can wreak all kinds of havoc. 

Fortunately for the makers of anti-virus software, Fortune 100 companies are 
acutely aware of the problem, and they are keeping security software firms busier 
than ever--and that makes them an attractive target for private equity as well.

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. Picks and pans: Telecom favorites and has-beens
Charles Payne rates 17 telecom stocks that sank like hot air balloons for their 
ability to regain altitude or not.

By Charles Payne, founder, CEO, and principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies 

The telecommunications sector's equipment makers has been at the root of all 
the heartache felt by investors over the last two-years; it represents the 
bloated inventories and even more bloated valuations; investors thought they 
were gliding to a land of early retirements, vacation homes and endless toys when 
the balloon began to lose air (it didn't pop, but behaved more like a hot air 
balloon that descended faster and faster as it approached a hard landing). 
Like visionaries in love with a concept, investors are still in love with 
the telecommunications space and will continue to bet on the balloon recovering 
altitude and taking flight once more. I agree that some of these balloons will 
indeed become airborne, but getting them off the ground will be trickier than 
advertised.

2. Upwards revisions: Better and better
Rather than taking the sector as a whole, investors should consider individual 
opportunities.

By Dave Sterman

Recessions are something of a double-edged sword for investors. On the one hand, 
sales growth slows for many of their portfolio companies, taking share prices 
on a southbound trajectory. But for those with cash to spare, they have a rare 
chance to buy quality companies at fire sale prices.

With that in mind, we went screening for long-term winners in the telecom sector 
that are now quite cheap. We specifically sought out stocks that are now fairly 
inexpensive when compared to their historical earnings growth rate. As the  
accompanying table shows, these stocks have a PEG (price/earnings ratio in 
relation to earnings growth) of below 0.7. 

And to make sure that analyst sentiment corroborates the attractive valuation, 
we insisted these stocks be supported by at least three ""strong buy"" ratings, 
and that analysts have raised their ratings over the last three months.

3. Upside potential: Unusual support looms for tower stocks
Debt burdens and zoning laws may seem like unlikely benefits, but there you 
have it.

By Dave Sterman

Toss another sector into the telecom rubble. Shares of cell tower operators 
are hitting new lows and now sell for just a small fraction of their peaks. 
Curiously, on many levels, the sector is fairly healthy; revenues are strong, 
and major players have been able to avoid the cutthroat price wars that have 
characterized the rest of the telecom industry.

That apparent disconnect could spell an opportunity for investors with a strong 
stomach for a long and bumpy ride. These firms are saddled with eye-popping 
levels of debt, but should soon benefit from a much more rational operating 
landscape. Weaker players are on the ropes, and their eventual demise will enable 
the stronger players to get back on their feet as they garner a bigger slice of 
the pie.

4. International wires: From Russia with love
A troika of telecom stocks that are well-positioned for current trends and gaining 
analyst esteem.

BYLINE: Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

When shares of Russian-based telecom companies start earning a measure of analyst 
esteem, savvy investors owe it to themselves to take a further look.

To be sure, these three Russian telcos haven't yet attained analysts' highest rating, 
but quite surprisingly--and seemingly out of nowhere--each has an average rating better 
than a neutral 3, and one of them has moved up to an average rating of 2 (""buy""). 
What gives?

5. Changing directions: Mobile phone makers eye wireless Internet opportunity
Companies look past current troubles toward growing the mobile data market

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Worsening economic conditions have caused a major strategic shift in the mobile 
handset industry. The segment's top companies have begun to de-emphasize phone 
sales and are eyeing the wireless Internet as a key driver of future revenues.

It's no surprise given recent industry performance. Third quarter handset 
shipments were down by 10% over last year. Motorola's (MOT) sales fell by 22% 
in the quarter, and Ericsson's (ERICY) phone operations have been so damaging 
to its bottom line that the company finally moved them into a joint venture with 
Sony (SNE).

Investment ideas 
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
Stimulus is the key going forward
Investors themselves, and not any single outside force, may 
generate a further market rally.

By Charles Payne, founder, CEO, and principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

With Thanksgiving smack dab in the middle of the week, it was hard determining 
what the market wanted to do or where investors' heads were at. After all, the 
market seemed to be running on empty until the holiday-shortened Friday 
session, when the market zoomed. Of course, sticking with the engine analogy, 
nay-sayers will say that the market was just rolling downhill, benefiting from an 
abbreviated session that saw lighter-than-normal volume. I would agree that 
Fridays session wasnt an apples-to-apples comparison with regular sessions--it 
was more like running a soapbox derby racer versus an open-wheel Indy-type 
car that the market typically runs during a full session. According to those folks 
that dont believe in the current market rally, Fridays results were amusing and 
even entertaining, but of no enduring value.

It would be easy to write the session off as a day-race that held little value in the 
grand scheme of things, but that would be a big mistake. In the soapbox derby, 
gravity draws the homemade racers down a modest hill. The same could have 
happened to stocks on Friday. Instead stocks climbed up that same modest hill. 
Stocks defied both gravity and the naysayers by trading higher and higher as the 
day went on. There is a message in that achievement: I think it tells us that when 
left to its own devices, the market wants to rally higher. Sure, when there are 
earnings reports, economic data, brokerage downgrades, wars, unemployment, 
fear, and warnings from corporate America, the race becomes akin to handling a 
high-performance race car and turning corners at 180 miles an hour. It isnt as 
easy as it looks.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Models of success?
Surviving Internet players have better business models, but share 
prices may still be too high for some.

By Dave Sterman

In a few weeks, 2001 will come to a close, putting the wraps on a forgettable year 
for the Internet sector. Many firms have already headed for bankruptcy, and other 
weaker players are also expected to shutter operations later in the winter. 

But investors are clearly focusing on the eventual winners in the Internet space, 
as share prices for healthier companies have been soaring in recent weeks. This 
week, we went looking for net stocks that are still growing and appear firmly in 
the ""survivor"" category.  

We specifically looked for Web-oriented companies that are boosting sales at a 
heady clip. As the accompanying table shows, these stocks have also seen their 
shares rise sharply, leading to the question: are they still a bargain?
