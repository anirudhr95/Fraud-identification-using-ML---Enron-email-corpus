Midland Power bill is passed due for the month of October.  The amount is 90,148.57.  I told Roger Wieck at Midland Power a check would be mailed today or Monday, and please do not turn off the power to the compressor.  Mark Knippa said he would call Roger Wieck at 515-386-4111.  Karen Gruesen informed me that the payments have not been released by the Cash Management Team.

"SoCalGas Unbundling","The CPUC published the SoCalGas unbundling order yesterday however due to Outlook problems I was unable to distribute it until today.  Attached is a direct link to the order for your review.  Since I'm using the website link to Outlook to send this e-mail, please let me know if you can't open the attachment and I will send it again when Outlook is back up in Omaha.  The order is about 163 pages in length so if you don't have a good copier and want a hardcopy please give either myself or Blair a call and we will provide it for you. 
 
Significantly for Transwestern is the section on Intrastate Transmission Capacity and the Open Season process.  This can be found on pages 41-58 with the Open Season discussion on pages 44 and 45.  On pages 126 and 140, the commission directs SoCal to include an additional 375mm/d of backbone (including receipt point) capacity in the open season process.  This is important because it includes the 50mm/d at Needles (per SoCal's exhibits in the system adequacy docket).  In the Comprehensive Settlement, Appendix B, North Needles is listed as having capacity of 750mm/d of Primary Access Rights from Transwestern.  It would be my recommendation that we need to encourage SoCal to revise this Appendix B as directed by the Commission to include the 50mm/d as capacity with Primary Access Rights from Transwestern as they had previously indicated in the Systems Adequacy Proceeding.  
 
SoCalGas was directed to file an Advice Letter to establish tariff revision to implement this order within 15 business  days of the effective date (December 11,2001).  Assuming two holidays for Christmas and New Years Day, this would make their filing date January 3, 2002.  If we all agree that we need to encourage SoCal to add the 50mm/d as part of the open season process, then this needs to be done prior to their Jan. 3rd filing.  Steve/Lorraine, please let me know if I can be of assistance.  Following their filing, interested parties have 20 days to file a protest and/or comments on an Advice Letter filing (January 23, 2002).
 
Please review the order or pertinent portions and advise of any comments you may have for our response.  I'll be in the office this week and on vacation between Christmas and New Years Day however I can be reached at home anytime.  My home number is (402) 330-3860.  gh

Drew and Greg,

	Andy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as ""President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division"".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  I wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. I would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.

<b>Tip of the Day</b>
<br>
In Good Time
<br>
<br>
If your New Year's resolutions include losing weight, give <br>yourself the best chance to succeed by making changes<br>gradually.
<br><br>
In one study of people who were successful at losing<br>
weight, making gradual changes over a long period of time <br>
appeared to be one of the keys to keeping the weight off.<br>
Instead of drastically reducing your calorie or fat intake,<br>
make small, sustainable, incremental changes to your diet.
<br>
<br>
RealAge Benefit: Maintaining your weight and body mass <br>index at a desirable level can make your RealAge as much <br>as 6 years younger.

"Pacific Gas and Electric - Transwestern Concerns"," I received a call from Jack Foley from the PG&E Credit Risk area regarding concerns to their exposure from TW. He cited that due to the' CC' S & P rating they had concerns regarding their monthly prepayment to TW of approximately $ 1.8 M, our marketing of their excess capacity, and the Operating Agreement at the interconnect regarding indemnification of the PCB cleanup.
He stated that PG&E has exposure as a result of TW marketing their excess capacity which at present TW has paid PG & E it's portion. However, we are due to remarket in January for their Spring/Summer capacity where we bill, collect and remit to PG &E. Also, he advised that per the Operating Agreement at the interconnect, dated June 27, 1995, there is an indemnification for PCB cleanup and that we pay PG & E $ 300,000 to $ 400,000 per year and the agreement runs to 2007. He added that there is a reaffirmation of the 1995 agreement dated May 28,1999, with Steve and Lou as the signers. 

In order to alleviate their concerns, Foley proposed, 1) TW drop the prepayment requirement and 2) provide security/collateral to secure the remarketing and PCB cleanup.

Please review and advise your comments.

Regards.

"PG&E's Gas Accord II","The CPUC has issued a Notice of the Prehearing Conference for PG&E's Gas Accord II  filing to be held on January 7, 2002.  Prehearing conference statements are to be filed by January 2, 2002.  You may recall that the PG&E filing in October was a request to simply extend their current rates for two additional years for the period of Jan. 1, 2003 through Dec. 31, 2004.  They based their request on the unresolved bankruptcy reorganization plan and uncertain gas markets.  

Dan Douglas provided us a summary of the filing and my recollection is that after reviewing the filing and his summary we were of the opinion that the rate extension probably would have minimal impact on TW however their reorganization plan to convert their backbone system to an interstate pipeline via a filing at FERC could certainly have an impact.  In that regard, Jeff Dasovich has scheduled a conference call on January 8th with PG&E to discuss their FERC filing and TW will be participating in that call.  

Given our initial reaction to this filing, to what extent do we want to particiapate in this proceeding and do we want to use Dan?  At minimum we had intended to have Dan file a prehearing statement for us.  However given our cash concerns, before calling Dan I wanted to make sure we were still on the same track.  Below is the link to the Prehearing Notice.  gh

Mr. Roger Wick


Midland Power

As we discussed this morning, even though Northern Natural Gas is not a party to the subject ENA/Midland contract, we would be adversely affected should the power service at that location be shut off.  I appreciate your agreeing to notify me (as a courtesy) in advance (402) 398-7061 of any such cessation of service prior to it occurring.

In answer to your specific question, the appropriate party to contact who represents ENA is Mark Knippa, who can be reached at (713) 853-3463.  Only he or whomever he directs you to can speak for ENA.

I understand you just received several documents from ENA and wish to review them before commenting further regarding what Midlands future actions might be.  I also understood you to say that in any event you would not discontinue service over the weekend and not without 24 hours notice so that someone could meet your folks at the site.

Contacts of value to you might be:

ENA Mark Knippa  (713) 853-3463

NNG Tom Gilbert, Regional Director Operations (515) 226-2075
NNG Pierre Marion, Operator at Hubbard Station (319) 269-5003

"FW: Operational issues","Ugh.  Call me when you get in--I've got a 1:30 conf. call but otherwise am clear.  Seems to me we will, at minimum, need to have gas control and commercial folks on high alert to persuade/bully people into not screwing us for a while.  Thanks.  DF

Drew we need to talk today about the operational issues that we are likely to face when TW files bankruptcy.  Basically I believe parties will start shorting us gas and TW is the least prepared of any of our pipes to deal with this as we have no penalty provisions,. No OFOs.  We may need emergency FERC help with this.  I will be in the office by noon

"RE: PG&E's Gas Accord II","After reviewing the Pre-hearing conference statement, I feel that at this juncture all that may be needed is for TW to enter an appearance. I don't believe that we currently have a position as to ""whether PG&E's proposed resolution of the issues raised by parties in their protests is agreeable"" such that we could file a statement as the judge has requested. Therfore, unless someone can summarize the parties positions and their impact on TW I would suggest that we use Jeff Dasovich to file an appearance for us since that would be the least costly alternative. If anyone has other suggestions please let me know.

Subject:	PG&E's Gas Accord II

The CPUC has issued a Notice of the Prehearing Conference for PG&E's Gas Accord II  filing to be held on January 7, 2002.  Prehearing conference statements are to be filed by January 2, 2002.  You may recall that the PG&E filing in October was a request to simply extend their current rates for two additional years for the period of Jan. 1, 2003 through Dec. 31, 2004.  They based their request on the unresolved bankruptcy reorganization plan and uncertain gas markets.  

Dan Douglas provided us a summary of the filing and my recollection is that after reviewing the filing and his summary we were of the opinion that the rate extension probably would have minimal impact on TW however their reorganization plan to convert their backbone system to an interstate pipeline via a filing at FERC could certainly have an impact.  In that regard, Jeff Dasovich has scheduled a conference call on January 8th with PG&E to discuss their FERC filing and TW will be participating in that call.  

Given our initial reaction to this filing, to what extent do we want to particiapate in this proceeding and do we want to use Dan?  At minimum we had intended to have Dan file a prehearing statement for us.  However given our cash concerns, before calling Dan I wanted to make sure we were still on the same track.  Below is the link to the Prehearing Notice.  gh

"Legal Edge Signon Changes","Dear Legal Edge User,

If you are using the Legal Edge portal, please read this very important message.

We wanted to inform you that changes have been made to access the Enron Legal Edge portal.

What to Expect
When accessing the legal edge portal at http://legaledge.corp.enron.com/tibco/, you will be prompted for a user name and password as usual.  However, the user name has changed. You will no longer log into the portal with your legal edge passwords. Your access will be controlled via the standard Enron network directory. Therefore, effective immediately, you will login using the same user name and password used to login to your local workstation, your CORP ID. 

In addition to the different user name and password, there will be another change. Due to the application upgrade, any personalization you have made to the portal in the past will be lost. As those changes made are associated with your old legal edge portal user name, these personalizations will not automatically be applied to your CORP login. Therefore, do not be alarmed if you do not see all of the content you saw before. Simply, re-configure the portal for your CORP id to see the same content you saw before. Unfortunately, there is no way to get around this issue.

Benefits
- Only one user name password to remember (Use CORP network id and password)
- Not prompted for login for other applications participating in Single Signon
- Once you login once, you will never be required to login again from that workstation (unless you click the logout link)

Effective Date
The Legal Edge portal / Single Signon integration is effective Friday, November 9.

Forward Email to Administrative Staff
Please forward this email to your the administrative staff of your department, so they can access the portal site. Thank you.

Contact Us
If you would like to provide feedback for the Single Sign-On effort, send an email to sso@enron.com. If you have issues or concerns regarding this change, please contact the Resolution Center at ext. 3-1411.


Regards,
The Legal Edge and Single Signon Teams

Subject:	FW: Pacific Gas and Electric - Transwestern Concerns

In regard to the requests made by PG&E and concern for their Transwestern exposure, the following is my proposed response. Please advise any comments or concerns.

1. The prepayment mechanism remain while PG&E remains in Bankruptcy. It is projected that they would emerge December 2002.

2. Reject the request to post collateral to secure their Capacity Release transactions. We would offer that although TW is presently rated ""CC"" by the rating agencies we take exception to the rating and have initiated discussions regarding a review. If necessary we would offer the non public financials on TW based upon execution of a Confidentiality Agreement.

3. Reject the request to post collateral as the Indemnification does not prescribe.

I am planning to respond December 19.

Regards.

Greg,

In regard to the issues below, I would propose the following responses. The reason for the email is I have received a followup message from Foley @PG&E.

1. PG&E remain on prepay as long as they are operating in Chpt. 11

2. I would decline on the posting of collateral on Capacity Release transactions. We disagree with the Rating Agencies on the downgrade. I would offer the Form 2 and Form 11 for their review and if PG&E would be willing to execute a Confidentiality Agreement, we would provide the non public financials for their reassurance.Kevin Howard is in communication with the Agencies for a review.

3. I would look for your direction on how to respond on the PCB issue.

Also, I am planning on forwarding my responses internally so all will be aware in the event they are contacted by PG&E.

Thanks and Regards.

Subject:	Pacific Gas and Electric - Transwestern Concerns

 I received a call from Jack Foley from the PG&E Credit Risk area regarding concerns to their exposure from TW. He cited that due to the' CC' S & P rating they had concerns regarding their monthly prepayment to TW of approximately $ 1.8 M, our marketing of their excess capacity, and the Operating Agreement at the interconnect regarding indemnification of the PCB cleanup.
He stated that PG&E has exposure as a result of TW marketing their excess capacity which at present TW has paid PG & E it's portion. However, we are due to remarket in January for their Spring/Summer capacity where we bill, collect and remit to PG &E. Also, he advised that per the Operating Agreement at the interconnect, dated June 27, 1995, there is an indemnification for PCB cleanup and that we pay PG & E $ 300,000 to $ 400,000 per year and the agreement runs to 2007. He added that there is a reaffirmation of the 1995 agreement dated May 28,1999, with Steve and Lou as the signers. 

In order to alleviate their concerns, Foley proposed, 1) TW drop the prepayment requirement and 2) provide security/collateral to secure the remarketing and PCB cleanup.

Please review and advise your comments.

Regards.

"RE: Richardson Products Co.","I would agree, as long as the payment was before Jan 1, so that they would be current before the next month flows began.    To the extent that they are not current then they do not meet the creditworthiness standards.     So as a solution to the whole thing, they pay on monday and we will forget the bad credit issue.    They pay after that and they are reported as a late payor/non-creditworthy.   It's at least a choice for them to make.

"RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding","I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about ""Shipper Imbalances"" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order (""OFO"") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

"ELM Finance Course Offerings","
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

Subject:	Transwestern Red Rock Expansion

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

Hope you had great Holidays and will have a Happy New Year!

When you get back, please fill out forms for all of these transfers.
None are from a marketing affiliate, so we do not have to send advance notice to the ETS Solution Center or give them an initial interview/training.
When you give the forms to me, I will sign and date them as approved as of today.
Don't forget to copy the elecronic versions of the forms to the ""Transfer"" folder.
You will have to create a new subfolder for 2002.
Also, please save Tracy's e-mail to the ""Reports"" folder.
The name of the saved document should include the last names of all five transfers.

What is the usual process on something like this?  Do we get a chance to respond to the protest before the FERC makes a decision on whether to hold a Tech Conf?  What is the timeline for any other protests to come in?  What is the timeline for FERC to decide?

For your info, we have received a protest and or reguest for Tech Conference or hearing from the CPUC regarding the USGT transaction starting Nov 1, 2001.  they raise the market power issue, the pricing, the volume, the policy of market based rates.  We expect a similar protest from IS, and also the issue regarding the alternate point use.  The volume on this transaction is for 400,000 per day with the negotiated rate provision only relating to the alternate path to Calif.   More to come.

"Switzer v. Chevron, et al","
	Kathy,

	You helped me on this before.  Plaintiffs are now pressing for a deposition on December 5 of a Rule 30(b)(6) corporate representative of TW in this matter in Houston at Susman, Godfrey's office.  You have already sent to me a list of contracts that might be relevant.  

	Bill Rapp got a telefax just recently on this from a Wes Hahn, who is apparently acting as a consultant/expert in this case for defendants.  Hahn has suggested that he appear as TW's corporate rep in this matter.  Hahn advises that he was an officer of TW and Enron ""at the time that this contract was in force and when it was terminated.""  I guess he means the processing contract between plaintiffs and Chevron that was terminated around 1996 when Chevron sold the Leedey plant to Dynegy.

	Let's talk tomorrow about how many contracts we have, how long they might take to review for privileges, etc., who would be the right corporate representative for TW, and so forth.  If you can think of anyone else who should be involved, please let me know.

	Given that Becky Zikes has actually worked for TW some years ago as a contract administrator, I'm going to ask her to attend our conference, as well as Barbara O'Banion, who just recently joined the Unit as a contract legal assistant.

	I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.

	Britt

	P.S.:  Dari, I included you because a processing plant was involved and thought you might be interested.  Do you want to be kept in the loop?

"1-URGENT - Outlook Email Notification (new)","OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: October 23rd

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

Subject:	BCAP Meet & Confer


The meet and confer in the SoCalGas/SDG&E 2003 BCAP was held as scheduled in San Francisco this morning.  Anticipating that today's meeting would be short and not very substantive, we decided I should participate by phone.  That turned out to be the right call, as the meeting was over by 10:15 a.m. and primarily focused on procedural matters.
 
The meeting started with SoCalGas giving an overview of the company's application, as well as the embedded cost study and revised testimony filed yesterday.  SDG&E then gave an overview of its application (SDG&E will file its embedded cost study shortly).  Both SoCalGas and SDG&E noted that they may need to submit revised BCAP applications if and when the Commission takes action in the Gas Industry Restructuring (""GIR"") proceeding, the Combined Core Portfolios application, and other pending gas proceedings.  Most significantly, the Revised Proposed Decision in the GIR approves most of the proposals covered by the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement (e.g., establishing a firm receipt point rights program).  If the Revised Proposed Decision is adopted, that would significantly narrow the scope of the BCAP.            
 
Next the parties discussed the procedural schedule.  The Office of Ratepayer Advocates (""ORA"") started things off by claiming it could not possibly have its ""reports"" on the BCAP applications (actually direct testimony) ready before mid March.  The rest of the discussion dealt with trying to fit the rest of the schedule in between ORA's testimony and January 1, 2003, the scheduled start of the next BCAP period.  The result is as follows:
 
Nov. 27        Pre-hearing conference statements
Dec. 04        Pre-hearing conference
Mar. 22        ORA direct testimony
Apr. 19        Interested parties direct testimony
May 10        All parties rebuttal testimony
May 16        Second pre-hearing conference
May 21        Hearings (up to 4 weeks)
July 19        Opening briefs
Aug. 09        Reply briefs
Nov. 12        Proposed decision
Dec.  28        Final decision           
 
The meeting ended at that point.  
 
We are reviewing SoCalGas' embedded cost study, etc., and have started contacting the noncore parties to get their take on things.  We will prepare a memo reporting the results of same. 
 
Best regards,

Sylvia, we have a new attorney from EES Legal ( Bill Rapp) starting in our group on October 22nd.  Will he need a new ID & Password set up with Lexis?  He probably has one already under EES Legal but I wasn't sure how that works.  Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Subject:	USGT Negotiated Rate Filing/ Response to CPUC Protest

Attached is a draft of Transwestern's response to the protest filed by the California Public Utility Commission in Docket No. RP97-288-017. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. 

I have gotten some additional information from Mark on USGT's use of westward capacity, which I haven't had the opportunity to review or incorporate in the attached draft. From what Mark has told me, it further supports the statement in our response that USGT has not made significant use of its westward capacity and that the CUPC's claim that Transwestern is being transformed into a pipeline that is dominated by shippers using negotiated rates is greatly exaggerated. 

We need to file the response on Wednesday. Therefore, I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon tomorrow. Thanks.

Charlie,

	I think your summary is very good. I would like to add that although Midland cannot discontinue service to ENA for failure to pay the $88,816.33 and $39,881.55 invoices, Midland can shut off service if ENA fails to pay any future invoices. So, it's imperative that someone from Northern very closely monitor the situation with ENA and Midland to ensure that ENA makes the necessary payments. In addition, the bankruptcy court may require ENA to provide Midland with ""adequate assurance"" of future payments. If required, this will most likely take the form of a cash deposit or a letter of credit. Again, if ENA fails to provide this adequate assurance, Midland may discontinue service.

Subject:	Hubbard (ENA)

After the meeting yesterday and speaking to Bill Rapp and several others today I believe I can summarize the Hubbard/ENA circumstances as they exist right now:

1)  The Hubbard Compression Services Agreement is with Enron North America (ENA) and ENA has filed for bankruptcy.
2)  The outstanding Oct. ($88,816.33) and Nov. ($39,881.55) Midland Power Coop electric bills to ENA have not been paid, and probably won't be until the bankruptcy proceeding unfolds (if at all).
3)  Under bankruptcy law, a utility cannot discontinue service to a debtor for not paying invoices outstanding at the time bankruptcy is filed and Bill Rapp has asked ENA's bankruptcy attorneys to provide the attached notice to Midlands Power Cooperative.
4)  Under supervision of the bankruptcy court, future invoices received after bankruptcy was filed (Dec 2) will be paid by ENA (if they have the cash?).
5)  ENA's nomination of 2,010 dth/d of ""Monthly Fuel Gas Payable"" from NNG has been confirmed and is flowing.  (This is their source of cash!?)
6)  Gas Accounting will continue to pay the ""Monthly Demand Charge"" ($64,549), and the ""Monthly Peak Compression Service Charges"" (ranges from $300 to $40,000).  The next payment is not due until the end of December.
7)  ENA's O&M payment to NNG for motor operation ($4,072.82) will be billed on the 20th of each month.  One month's payment should have been outstanding when bankruptcy was filed and therefore not paid, however, it was actually paid to NNG on Dec. 6th.
8)  ENA's next $320,000 ""Peak Associated Payment"" is not due to NNG until July 1, 2002.

There is no certainty when dealing with a bankrupt entity, however, this is where we are today.  The theme I keep hearing is business as usual. 

Tom,

Someone from Operations should probably follow-up with Midland Power (I suggest a boat load of empathy regarding their $128,000 in limbo) after they get the ENA letter.

?UNRESOLVED MANAGEMENT ISSUES

  Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing, or are you in a pick-and-choose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues when it comes to choosing legal research resources?

     --What do you do with a Federal question that properly demands a national look across all thirteen Federal circuits?

     What's not to like?

--TheLaw.net is less than $1 a day for an individual annual subscription to our Solo Edition. Even less per day, per workgroup user. See, http://www.thelaw.net/susbcribe.htm

Subject:	Color Laser Printer

The Color Laser Printer in my cube is up and running now!  :-)  

For those of you who had previously added this color printer to your selections, you'll need to delete that old icon because it's totally different this time.  Here's how you delete it:

""Start"" (in the lower left-hand corner of your monitor)
""Settings""
""Printers""
Highlight the printer you want to delete (call me if you're unsure which one)
Press the delete button on your keyboard
Make sure that's the one you really want to delete, and click ""YES""

Here's how you gain access to the new one:

""Start""
""Run""
In the box that says ""Open:"" type in the following (without the underlining):  \\wnahou-1005919\HPColorL
""OK""
""YES""
This printer has now been added to your printer selections

Lee, You don't have to do anything because I already added it to your computer.

PLEASE NOTE:  If you're printing to LEGAL paper, you'll need to manually change the paper cartridge before you select print.  If you call me, I'd be happy to change the cartridge to LEGAL for you, but I ask that you change it back to LETTER once you print so that it's not an inconvenience to others.  Mucho thanks!

Call me if questions.   Thanks for you patience in getting this up and running again!  :-)

<b>Tip of the Day</b>
<br>
Bubble Trouble
<br>
<br>
Are you planning on toasting the New Year but don't want <br>to drink something that will go straight to your head? If so, <br>pass on carbonated cocktails.
<br><br>
The air bubbles in champagne and carbonated mixers such <br>as tonic water cause the liquid to remain in your stomach <br>longer, increasing alcohol absorption. If you want to keep a <br>clear head, limit yourself to a drink or two and choose a <br>non-carbonated drink such as white table wine.
<br>
<br>
RealAge Cost: Drinking too much alcohol can make your <br>RealAge more than 3 years older.

Subject:	Northern Natural Gas - Marketing Affiliate Compliance

I'm a new addition to the gas pipeline legal group, having recently transferred from the EES legal department. Among other things, I'll be handling Northern Natural's compliance with the marketing affiliate rule. 

An issue has come up with Northern as a result of the recent changes at Enron Corp.

Andy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as ""President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division"".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  We wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. We would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

"RE: Northern Natural Gas - Marketing Affiliate Compliance","great--thanks for the update

Subject:	RE: Northern Natural Gas - Marketing Affiliate Compliance

	Actually, there was one new development late yesterday. Frazier wasn't entirely comfortable with having Andy Fastow in that role in the first place since he may have had access to transportation/capacity information in his capacity as CFO of Enron Corp. The same concern would, of course apply to Andy Fastow's successor. That was why Frazier had suggested Cindy Olsen. I spoke with Mary Kay and told her about this concern. She understands, but continues to feel that we should be able to come up with someone who is more substantively involved in Enron's underlying businesses but who does not have access to transportation/capacity information. I'll work with Frazier to see if we can identify someone. So, let's hold off for now in contacting Jeff McMahon. I'll keep you updated. Thanks.

Subject:	Northern Natural Gas - Marketing Affiliate Compliance

I'm a new addition to the gas pipeline legal group, having recently transferred from the EES legal department. Among other things, I'll be handling Northern Natural's compliance with the marketing affiliate rule. 

An issue has come up with Northern as a result of the recent changes at Enron Corp.

Andy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as ""President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division"".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  We wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. We would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

most upbeat perspectives on the future of e-business came from 
Tom Thomas, current CEO and chairman of Haht Commerce, and 
former CIO of Dell Computer (DELL) during the 1990s.

Taking the long-term view of e-business over the next decade, 
Thomas compared the current economic climate in 2001 to that of 
1991--a time when the United States was in the middle of a 
recession, but at the beginning of a decade when the deployment 
of new technologies would bring immense opportunity for growth.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Broadband goes mainstream
That sound you hear may be media finally streaming and screaming 
through fat pipes

By Dave Sterman, equity research columnist

Who needs a race car when the local speed limits are 10 miles per hour? 
That was the lesson learned by many Internet-oriented business models 
that delivered services geared towards high-speed access, only to find 
that most surfers were still connected to the Web by a dowdy 56K dial-
up modem. The promise of (high-speed) broadband connections has been 
so slow to materialize that many start-ups ran out of cash before ever 
garnering a large audience. Entire sectors, such as Web-based animation, 
have come and gone.

But just as the hype has cooled, it now looks like the promise of 
broadband may finally be realized as we head into 2002. Penetration 
rates are rising again, and could soon reach the critical mass necessary to 
make broadband a mainstream technology. Roughly 10.7 million U.S. 
households now have broadband access, representing about 16 percent of 
all households online, according to research firm the Yankee Group. 
That's up some 60 percent from 12 months ago.

Subject:	RE: Hubbard (ENA)

Charlie,

	I think your summary is very good. I would like to add that although Midland cannot discontinue service to ENA for failure to pay the $88,816.33 and $39,881.55 invoices, Midland can shut off service if ENA fails to pay any future invoices. So, it's imperative that someone from Northern very closely monitor the situation with ENA and Midland to ensure that ENA makes the necessary payments. In addition, the bankruptcy court may require ENA to provide Midland with ""adequate assurance"" of future payments. If required, this will most likely take the form of a cash deposit or a letter of credit. Again, if ENA fails to provide this adequate assurance, Midland may discontinue service.

Subject:	Hubbard (ENA)

After the meeting yesterday and speaking to Bill Rapp and several others today I believe I can summarize the Hubbard/ENA circumstances as they exist right now:

1)  The Hubbard Compression Services Agreement is with Enron North America (ENA) and ENA has filed for bankruptcy.
2)  The outstanding Oct. ($88,816.33) and Nov. ($39,881.55) Midland Power Coop electric bills to ENA have not been paid, and probably won't be until the bankruptcy proceeding unfolds (if at all).
3)  Under bankruptcy law, a utility cannot discontinue service to a debtor for not paying invoices outstanding at the time bankruptcy is filed and Bill Rapp has asked ENA's bankruptcy attorneys to provide the attached notice to Midlands Power Cooperative.
4)  Under supervision of the bankruptcy court, future invoices received after bankruptcy was filed (Dec 2) will be paid by ENA (if they have the cash?).
5)  ENA's nomination of 2,010 dth/d of ""Monthly Fuel Gas Payable"" from NNG has been confirmed and is flowing.  (This is their source of cash!?)
6)  Gas Accounting will continue to pay the ""Monthly Demand Charge"" ($64,549), and the ""Monthly Peak Compression Service Charges"" (ranges from $300 to $40,000).  The next payment is not due until the end of December.
7)  ENA's O&M payment to NNG for motor operation ($4,072.82) will be billed on the 20th of each month.  One month's payment should have been outstanding when bankruptcy was filed and therefore not paid, however, it was actually paid to NNG on Dec. 6th.
8)  ENA's next $320,000 ""Peak Associated Payment"" is not due to NNG until July 1, 2002.

There is no certainty when dealing with a bankrupt entity, however, this is where we are today.  The theme I keep hearing is business as usual. 

Tom,

Someone from Operations should probably follow-up with Midland Power (I suggest a boat load of empathy regarding their $128,000 in limbo) after they get the ENA letter.

"IMPORTANT     Re: SCG Advice 2837-A","Bill....will have the draft to you in about 30 minutes....however, wanted to
note that the SoCalGas advice letter was filed on November 1, meaning that
our comments are due TOMORROW, and not today.  When we were talking while I
was in the airport yesterday, I was thinking it was the 20th and not the
19th.  Comments on advice letters are due 20 days after filing, meaning
TOMORROW.

"RE:  EAP","I am appalled at the lack of seriousness with which some of you have responded to this heartfelt message.  I, however, am already taking drugs (or will be again shortly) - (legal prescribed drugs, of course) and have no need for any such assistance.  I truly believe that Enron will rise again.  And I am content to work in the shadow of such great lawyers as Drew and Greg (if they had been higher up, this would never have happened!)  As you can see, I am still completely capable of performing all of my duties - particularly the suck up requirement (although I have felt that Louie was surpassing me in this role with his previous message).

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Can you go ahead and add Louis P. Soldano to the NNG org chart.
He will be VP and Assistant General Counsel reporting to Drew.
While the effective date is the same as the date for Kevin, the date on the charts should be today's date.
(We always use the date of posting for the ""Updated"" date.)

Also, please add a job description for Lou to the Job Description posting for NNG.
There is already a job description for him on the TW posting.
Just use that description.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Subject:	TW Regulatory Matters Note -- Red Rock Draft

Please include the following paragraph in the TW regulatory matters Note:

On July 16, 2001 Transwestern was authorized to abandon and replace certain compressor station facilities located in Arizona (Red Rock Expansion).  The new compressor facilities will create 150,000 Mcf per day of incremental firm capacity on the western portion of Transwestern's system which terminates at the Arizona/California border.  Transwestern estimated the cost to abandon the existing units to be approximately $.4 million, and the cost to install the new units to be approximately $92.9 million.  The proposed in-service date for the Red Rock Expansion is June 1, 2002.  [Pryor, Tony]  Pursuant to an open season held by Transwestern late in 2000, a total of 106.7 Mcf per day has currently been subscribed under firm contracts.   [Pryor, Tony]  Transwestern has begun limited construction activities, and is awaiying additional environmental-related approvals to complete the project.

Here are the changes to the OBA.  Please review.  Also, please look at para 5(c).  Since this gas will only be a San Juan supply, we deleted the Permian and Anadarko price basins.  So, if the TW San Juan pricing information goes away, I would like to use El Paso San Juan Pricing instead of averaging the other two basins.  


Questar is coming in for a late lunch, do you think we can have this ready by then?


Thanks,  Kim.

"RE: Transwestern - Dispute with SoCal Gas","Bill good questions.  Lets discuss.  Do you know what the statute of  limitations is and when the clock starts.  Your insight would be appreciated.  To date, TW has only filed at FERC based on the thought we thought the issues were FERC issues and thought the FERC process would provide the least expensive and most expeditious forum.  The belief was that a state court would defer to the agency. TW's real hope is to get a settlement through mediation or, if we need to, some other form of FERC ADR.

Subject:	Transwestern - Dispute with SoCal Gas

	
	Greg,

		Thanks for sending me copies of the pleadings in the enforcement action that we've filed against SoCal Gas at FERC. Just a quick question. Should we initiate a state court action against SoCal Gas now so as to minimize any claims that could potentially be cut off by the applicable statute of limitations? I notice that the controversy goes back to 1996. It may take a while for FERC to resolve this. Have we concluded that even if FERC rules in our favor we would have to file a separate action in state court to enforce our rights under the transporation agreement(s) with SoCalGas? Even if we file a state court action now, SoCal Gas would probably argue that the state court action should not proceed until FERC reaches its decision. I don't know how strong an argument this is, but even if SoCal Gas keeps us from moving forward with a state court proceeding, would merely filing suit in state court stay the statute of limitations? I'm sure you've thought through these issues already. I'm just trying to get up to speed. Thanks.

"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

Subject: TW Operational Issues - Conference Call


With the possible inclusion of TW in a bankruptcy petition, we need to put our heads together to discuss the likely operational scenarios.
My concern is that parties with outstanding OBA balances due them will immediately begin to short us gas.  I see this happening as follows -- the marketer/producers will nominate/confirm a certain receipt quantity; we'll schedule a corresponding delivery quantity; then the marketer/producers will short us to offset against outstanding OBA balances.  If actual receipt flow is below scheduled, then TW can cut the delivery nominations, but without flow control at all points and without any tariff penalties (e.g. OFOs and the like), I don't see TW having any hammer to keep from losing line pack.

A conference call is scheduled for 3 PM CT this afternoon to discuss.  The call in number is 877-930-8819 (code 184262#).  

Let's discuss the following:
*	How realistic is the scenario described above
*	Who are the players that are likely to short us (Duke, Williams, etc)  and to what extent can they claim that they are entitled to short us to work off the OBA?
*	If producer/marketers short us on the receipt side, we can immediately cut deliveries (at least on paper).  What is the revenue impact of this (i.e. how much daily revenue is tied up in commodity/volumetric deals).
*	And, even if we cut deliveries on paper, to what extent do we have flow control to make this a physical reality?
*	Would any emergency FERC help (such as penalty authority) help for the points where we don't have flow control?

SoCalGas is circulating a draft pre-hearing conference statement for parties to sign on to, if they wish (please see attached).  Given Transwestern's position in the BCAP, it makes sense to sign on to SoCalGas' generic PHC statement.  Please take a few moments to review the same and let me know your thoughts.  SoCalGas has asked for a response by Tuesday noon.  Thanks.

Subject: A.01-09-024 PHC Statement draft
To: Parties Who Participated in the A.01-09-024 (SoCalGas and SDG&E BCAP) Meet and Confer: 
  Attached is a proposed PHC Statement as required by ALJ Brown in her Ruling of November 5, 2001.  Per that Ruling, this Statement must be filed within 10 days of our meeting (which by my calculation would be the 26th of November).  I would REALLY like to get it filed on the 21st if possible, before the Thanksgiving weekend.
  I tried to keep the Statement simple, while reflecting the consensus views articulated at the meeting.  I tried not to go into too much detail on the description of some of the outstanding CPUC proceedings that may affect this case, but wanted to give the judge some flavor for each proceeding.  I ask that each of you let me know by noon next Tuesday (the 20th) if you want to ""sign on.""  I will incorporate any non-substantive edits you may have.  For substantive edits (hopefully there will be few if any) I will do my best to incorporate.  However, let's remember that none of us want to be de-positioned by what is said in this document so argumentative statements will be ignored.  If only nonsubstantive edits are received, I will file on behalf of all participating parties without further review.  If substantive changes are made, a second review will be provided.
  I hope we can keep this from becoming an unwieldy exercise.  I ask for your cooperation and appreciate your input.  If you want to provide your individual PHC Statement, fine.  Just let me know so I can take your client's name off this one. 
Thanks again.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"RE: Transwestern Response to FERC Data Request - USGT Negotiated Rate Filing","
 	I am not sure who prepared the detail schedule for Data Request No. 4, but we have a few questions:

	  The letter agreement dated 2/6/2001, effective November 1, 2001, states 
		1.  Primary points - east to east flow  rate equals $0.025 demand rate and a maximum commodity rate which is 			$0.0147 inclusive of surcharges.   Why does the schedule have $0.0092 as the primary path rate?  Also since the 
		question asks for the transportation charged, we thought we would add the demand rate and the associated MDQ.
		
		2.  Alternate points - east to west flow - rate equals negotiated rate - but in no event shall the resultant commodity be 		less than $0.0246/MMBtu.  Why does the schedule have a rate of $0.0245/MMBtu?

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of TW's response to the FERC data request in the USGT negotiated rate proceeding. Please note that our response to Data Request No. 1, contemplates that we will provide to FERC copies of the other bids that were received on this capacity. We could attempt to summarize this other bids, but I think the better approach is to just provide copies. 

A schedule of actual volumes transported and actual rates charged USGT is attached (this is the Schedule C that is referenced in our response to Data Request No. 4). This will need to be updated next week prior to filing. I do not have the other attachments to the responses in electronic format. I can of course provide paper copies of these to anyone who would like to see them. 

I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon on Monday, December 10. Thanks.

Attached for your consideration is a draft motion to stike testimony related
to the embedded cost proposal in the SoCalGas/SDG&E BCAP.  I have drafted
this motion for EGA, but we would prefer to present it as part of a larger
group.  I have sent you this draft because you seem to represent parties who
might have similar concerns about the embedded cost proposal.
Would your clients be interested in co-sponsoring this motion?  If so,
please let me know as soon as possible.  Ideally, we would have a loose
group identified as the Moving Parties or something similar to sponsor the
motion.  I've dated the motion for Monday, because I think it would be most
effective if the motion is public when we discuss the schedule at Tuesday's
prehearing conference.
I would also appreciate any comments, edits, additions, or suggestions you
may have.  For example, we could use some more examples of other uses of
marginal costs in gas regulation.  Note that the wonders of Word's
footnoting function make this a little difficult to read on the screen.
If you're interested in joining in this motion, please let me know no later
than 10 a.m. Monday, December 3, and earlier is better.
Please keep this draft confidential for now.
Thanks,
Brian

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Subject:	FW: Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles

The posting process as discussed below in Steve Kirks email is what we believe is the best way to handle the sale of any incremental Needles only capacity.  

 In regard to new generally available capacity, for example as a result of a ROFR contract not rolling over,  the capacity would be posted as generally available, and again, per the tariff we are not required to agree to amend a primary point.  We would suggest use of a posting/open season that follows the turnback capacity for sale with the parameters for bidding laid out, including the time period for which we are accepting bids.  If no acceptable bids are received, and a shipper asks to amend their primary point, the tariff provides the right to decline unless agreed.  However, if you have given a shipper the contractual right to change their primary point ie, request an available point, you will have to accept the request.   Hope this helps and concurs with our discussion today.

Subject:	Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles

Based upon our understanding of the request from TW Marketing, here is our suggested position on the posting and awarding of potential take-away capacity at SoCal Needles from approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.

TW would post on its website a notice in the capacity section that, based on information provided by SoCal regarding an expansion on their system, the take-away capacity at SoCal Needless may be increased by __Dth/day for the period of approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.  Shippers would be advised that the actual start date would depend on SoCal completing their system modifications. The posting would say that TW would accept requests for such capacity during a stated period of time (a minimum of 3 business days).  TW would award the capacity to the shipper(s) willing to provide the greatest cost commitment. The greatest cost commitment would be defined as those revenues above and beyond the current revenues which Transwestern already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.

Call me and I'll arrange for us to meet to discuss this further.   sjk

Subject:	FW: SCG Advice 2837-A

After discussing with Lynn and Glen, we think that we would like to file comments in this proceeding concerning an issue we have had since this has been implemented on Nov 1.  In instances where SoCal happens to call their OFO in the Intraday 2 cycle, it can cause Transwestern to have Shipper imbalances because we do not have an opportunity to pass-along these reductions to our upstream parties.  We think we would like to file a letter that may mention our general support of the ""direction"" of SoCal's changes, but that we do have an issue that has developed since actual implementation that we are currently working on with them.  Lynn & I worked on this rough general description we thought could be incorporated into a brief letter.
	
		""If SoCal calls an OFO in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCal.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is unable to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.""

Lynn thinks if we are unable to resolve this issue with SoCal, TW could have high Shipper imbalance exposure.

Glen and Steve:
 
The attached supplemental advice filing by SoCalGas replaces the  changes to Rule 30, Transportation of Customer-Owned Gas, proposed by AL2837.   The purpose of this filing is to  describe the new internal receipt point operating procedures that SoCalGas is  implementing, and to request Commission authorization to include the revised  operating procedures in Rule 30. SoCalGas says this step is being taken in  anticipation that it will be replaced with a system of firm tradable intrastate  transmission rights in Gas Industry Restructuring (GIR) proceeding, I.99-07-003.  
During  the GIR panel hearings, several parties requested that SoCalGas publish its  windowing criteria in tariffs to facilitate a better understanding of the method  used to allocate receipt point  capacity.  SoCalGas agreed to make  such a filing, and D.99-07-015 directed SoCalGas to file an advice letter adding  windowing information to its tariffs.  To comply with this directive, on August  6, 1999, SoCalGas filed AL2837, which has not been acted on by the Commission.  
Customer complaints about SoCalGas' windowing  procedures have convinced SoCalGas that it should replace its internal  windowing operating procedures with a system that is open to the maximum  operating capacity at each SoCalGas receipt point.  SoCalGas is making these internal  operating changes effective November 1, 2001.  SoCalGas held meetings with upstream  pipelines on October 17, and with interested customers and stakeholders on  October 18, regarding the upcoming changes.  They were invited to ask any questions in  the days leading up to the meetings. 
Comments and/or protests are due on November 21.  Have a good  weekend!

Investment strategies 
-----------------------------------------

What's in store
Investors get ready to ride into smoother waters  
 
By Carla Drysdale, columnist 
 
As we bid farewell to a year in which many of us dealt 
directly with loss of lives, jobs, and investments, the 
Big Ball of 2002 is poised to bring in what we hope will 
be a brighter new year. Now, more than halfway 
through the fourth quarter, the venture capital market 
is still far from robust. Where will it go from here and 
which will be the startups that drive VC investments in 
2002? 
 
For the moment, venture capitalists are putting most 
of their money into saving existing businesses, rather 
than starting new ones. According to data from 
VentureWire, a division of New York-based 
Technologic Partners, halfway through the fourth 
quarter, seed money and first-round financing 
accounted for just 12 percent of all disbursements, 
down from 25 percent in the first quarter.

Subject:	TW Regulatory Matters Note -- Red Rock Draft

Please include the following paragraph in the TW regulatory matters Note:

On July 16, 2001 Transwestern was authorized to abandon and replace certain compressor station facilities located in Arizona (Red Rock Expansion).  The new compressor facilities will create 150,000 Mcf per day of incremental firm capacity on the western portion of Transwestern's system which terminates at the Arizona/California border.  Transwestern estimated the cost to abandon the existing units to be approximately $.4 million, and the cost to install the new units to be approximately $92.9 million.  The proposed in-service date for the Red Rock Expansion is June 1, 2002.  [Pryor, Tony]  Pursuant to an open season held by Transwestern late in 2000, a total of 106.7 Mcf per day has currently been subscribed under firm contracts.   [Pryor, Tony]  Transwestern has begun limited construction activities, and is awaiying additional environmental-related approvals to complete the project.

Attached is a revised draft of the letter. The only change from the prior draft is to the volumes in the first sentence of the second paragraph. I've changed the contracted capacity figure from 120,000 Mcf to 106,700 per feedback from Keith. I think this is now ready to file, except that we will need to fill in the blanks. Please confirm this and give me a call at your convenience so that we can discuss the logistics of the filing. Thanks.

Subject:	Marketing Affiliate Compliance - Northern Natural

		

Drew and Greg,

	Andy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as ""President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division"".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  I wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. I would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.

"RE: your digits","Bill: 
 
Great to hear from you.  To be sure, it's jazz, not classical.  I've
still got some growing to do.  I think of you every time I put on The
Essential Stan Getz (sp?).  Great recommendation.  I've bought some Nina
Simone lately -- most recently Best Of and Blues.  
 
I did see Run Lola Run -- great movie.  Haven't been going to the movies
a lot lately b/c of Alex (my new son).  It's a fair trade though.  I'll
pick up ""Momento"" next time I'm at Blockbuster, and check out the
classical discs you recommended.  
 
Work is good -- I'm not sure if you know what we do -- we buy people out
of their lp interests before the term of the partnership.  Esentially,
providing liquidity to an otherwise illiquid market.  There's a lot of
crap on the market these days, but every now and then you get someone
selling good interest too.  It's mentally stimulating and professionally
accretive, so I'm very happy.  Thanks again for the referral -- that was
very helpful in making it all happen.
 
Well, I'll scan my recent disc purchases to see if there's any other
buys I think you ought to put on your list.
 
All the best,
Mark

Mark,
 
        Great to hear from you! The last few weeks have definitely been
a difficult period. I still can't believe it. I'm doing fine and
actually think that things areb eginning to stabilize. 
 
        So, how's the baby doing? And how are you doing? John W. called
about a week ago and said he thought you were doing well and seemed to
be enjoying your new job (I guess it's not so new anymore). You
definitely made the right decision to leaveS tratum. As you've probably
heard, they haven't been able to raise any money and now plan to
liquidate. I think they're down to four or five people in New York and
about the same number in Houston. 
 
        My address is as follows: 714 Camelot Lane, Houston, Texas
77024. 
 
        Again it's really good to hear from you. Best wishes. (Oh yeah,
in case you haven't already seen the following movies, I highly
recommend them: ""Run Lola Run"" (German with English subtitles) and
""Memento"" (American) - both are available on videotape.) (Also, if I
remember correctly, you like classical music, so you mighte njoy Murray
Perahia's (sp?) recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations.) Take care.

"RE: Hubbard (ENA)","I visited with Charlie Graham this AM.  To the best of operations knowledge, the past due statement for October(past due Dec. 2nd.) was mailed Dec.5th.  Midlands normal practice is to discontinue service 10 days after mailing the past due notice.  I think it is safe to assume that we must have the attached letter in the appropriate Midland Officials hand before the 15th.

Charlie has agreed to represent Operations and call Midland power and to assure the letter is received by Midland asap.

Charlie,  the following are contacts we have used in the past for Midland.
Roger Wick---515-386-4111  (most likely the best starting point)
Patrick Minnick---712-297-5738  Key Accounts Executive
Norm Fandel---515-386-4111   Director of Marketing


Jerry, we should probably visit about this on the outage call this afternoon.  We'll need to get planning to run some capacity numbers just in case.

Subject:	Hubbard (ENA)

After the meeting yesterday and speaking to Bill Rapp and several others today I believe I can summarize the Hubbard/ENA circumstances as they exist right now:

1)  The Hubbard Compression Services Agreement is with Enron North America (ENA) and ENA has filed for bankruptcy.
2)  The outstanding Oct. ($88,816.33) and Nov. ($39,881.55) Midland Power Coop electric bills to ENA have not been paid, and probably won't be until the bankruptcy proceeding unfolds (if at all).
3)  Under bankruptcy law, a utility cannot discontinue service to a debtor for not paying invoices outstanding at the time bankruptcy is filed and Bill Rapp has asked ENA's bankruptcy attorneys to provide the attached notice to Midlands Power Cooperative.
4)  Under supervision of the bankruptcy court, future invoices received after bankruptcy was filed (Dec 2) will be paid by ENA (if they have the cash?).
5)  ENA's nomination of 2,010 dth/d of ""Monthly Fuel Gas Payable"" from NNG has been confirmed and is flowing.  (This is their source of cash!?)
6)  Gas Accounting will continue to pay the ""Monthly Demand Charge"" ($64,549), and the ""Monthly Peak Compression Service Charges"" (ranges from $300 to $40,000).  The next payment is not due until the end of December.
7)  ENA's O&M payment to NNG for motor operation ($4,072.82) will be billed on the 20th of each month.  One month's payment should have been outstanding when bankruptcy was filed and therefore not paid, however, it was actually paid to NNG on Dec. 6th.
8)  ENA's next $320,000 ""Peak Associated Payment"" is not due to NNG until July 1, 2002.

There is no certainty when dealing with a bankrupt entity, however, this is where we are today.  The theme I keep hearing is business as usual. 

Tom,

Someone from Operations should probably follow-up with Midland Power (I suggest a boat load of empathy regarding their $128,000 in limbo) after they get the ENA letter.

"RE: ENA Capacity Release","Bill,

I've made a couple of changes related to ENA having two contracts that we want to market via this method.  Please check my comments and look to see if any of the other language needs to be changed for the additional agreement.  The letter looks great to me.  Thanks for all of your help on this.  Once we hear back from you, we will tender to ENA for their execution so we can proceed forward in selling this capacity.

Thanks, Kim.

Subject:	Columbia Gulf order on negotiated rates

I received a copy of an order issued by the FERc on Columbia negotiated rate transaction, which includes a formula ie indexed rate.  They accepted the negotiated rate deal but they are requiring  them to file in their tariff within ONE DAY after the rate has been determined the contract and actual rate. ( Each time the actual rate changes during the term)   Just think about this for the upcoming TW_ USGT deal and NNG""- Reliant deals.    Notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing, the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day---  I believe this is FERC's way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals-  they are punishing themselves as well, as each filing will require a notice etc-  so every day they could need to issue an order.   

I feel we need to discuss with Columbia, INGAA and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare.  An alternative would be to require you to post on Internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate, so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate.  I'm sending you guys a copy of the order.

Linda,

	This looks fine. I just want to confirm that we do not countersign this transportation service request when we receive it from the potential shipper. Instead, we process the request and generate a transportation agreement that we send to the shipper for execution. When we receive an executed transportation agreement from the shipper, we countersign it and begin service. Is this correct?

"RE: SoCalGas Response to TW Protest of AL 2837-A","	Glen, I had a conversation with Pat Davidson (SoCal) yesterday.  Things have been going smoothly,
	because SoCal has not been calling any OFO days.  She felt like we would not have an issue until
	spring and at that time, there is an expectation that SoCal could be calling more OFOs.  We agreed
	to continue talking, but that does not resolve the issue completely.  Thanks. Lynn

Attached is the SoCalGas response of our mild protest to their advice  letter 2837-A.  The relevant language is on page 5 of their letter and has  been highlighted for your convenience.  In part, they state that:   
 
""These types of reductions are no different from today's  practice of allowing customers to reduce nominations in the fourth scheduling  cycle.  The flaw is not in SoCalGas  new procedures.  SoCalGas provides  customers with notice of an upcoming OFO two hours prior to scheduling cycle  closing times.  Within those two  hours, customers can make changes to their nominations and still meet the  scheduling timeline as defined by GISB standards.  Even if SoCalGas cuts nominations in  cycle four because customer reductions don't reduce deliveries enough to avoid  operational problems, changes in cycle 4 are within GISB standards.  Transwestern is supposed to be complying  with those GISB standards and seems to state that it is unable to do  so.""
 
They go on to state a willingness to  work with us on the issue.  There is no procedural option for us to respond  to their response.  At this point, our option is to meet with Energy  Division staff to discuss the issue further, should we feel the need to do  so.  
 
Have a good weekend!
Dan

"Good to hear from you!","

Good morning -

I am glad that things have started to stabilize at Enron.  On the side 
lines, we still have our fingers crossed for all of you.

Thanks for asking about Caleb.  He did not/has not gotten pneumonia yet but 
it has been a struggle.  He does not respond to cough medicine at all, in 
fact it makes him worse.  What I finally got the hang of is using Vicks 
Vapor Rub.  Other than feeling great, I really had no idea that it could 
work wonders so at least I have gotten to add new ""remedy"" info to my list 
<g>.

I am still hoping that we can get together before Christmas.  I don't know 
what your schedule is this week but mine should start to loosen up towards 
the end.  You aren't open for Friday are you?

Regardless, it was really good to hear from you and thanks for keeping us in 
your thoughts.

Lili

P.S.  I am sending this to your work address but will be careful not to use 
too often.

Subject:	Northern Natural Gas - Marketing Affiliate Compliance

I'm a new addition to the gas pipeline legal group, having recently transferred from the EES legal department. Among other things, I'll be handling Northern Natural's compliance with the marketing affiliate rule. 

An issue has come up with Northern as a result of the recent changes at Enron Corp.

Andy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as ""President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division"".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  We wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. We would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.

"re: Starwood Questions","Bill,

I hope your new job is treating you well.  Sorry to bother you but I had two more questions regarding Starwood that I am hoping you can answer.  They both regard the DSM projects.

1. If Starwood chooses not to use their own capital for DSM projects, is EES obliged to provide lease financing?

2. Related to the above, if we are obliged, are we limited in the rate we can charge?  i.e. Could we charge a ""discouraging"" rate?  The language in the MLA Section 2.2 seems to be adequately vague that if we were having trouble raising capital ourselves, we could pass those costs through as ""such other factors as are customarily considered by lessor parties providing lease financing for similar equipment and terms.""  

These questions came up when RAC looked at our summary documentation.  I am hoping these are quick questions for you.  Please let me know.

Thanks again,
Chris

"RE: answer to cpuc protest","I think we could wind this up with a quick conference call tomorrow a.m.  Greg and I had some additional thoughts on how to handle the issue that this contract is not for 40% of primary capacity - it is not like an El Paso/Dynegy, Enron or El Paso deal without necessarily getting into the alternate issue of sham transactions.  Also, Kathy R. checked and as of today, IS have not filed a protest.  Maria

"FW: Organizational Change","
One of my goals as ETS General Counsel is to assure that the group is organized in a way that allows all of us to provide quality services to our clients in the most efficient manner possible.  One of the ways to do this is to modify our internal organization to better track the ""functionalized"" organization that ETS has recently adopted in the operations and commercial areas.  Additionally, we must continually revisit the way we allocate our resources to reflect client priorities.  Accordingly, I am pleased to announce that Colleen Raker will begin reporting directly to me, effective immediately.  Richard Melton, Lee Huber and Kim Wilkie will report to Colleen.  Colleen's team will have primary responsibility for serving the ""new business generation"" efforts within Steve Hotte's IT group and Phil Lowry's Operations group.  Additionally, Colleen's team will focus on asset purchase and sale transactions and financings, while Colleen and Richard will take lead responsibility on pipeline security efforts led by Mike Nelson's team.  Each of these lawyers will also continue serving the numerous other clients they assisted before this organizational change.

Lou Soldano's group will continue its emphasis on serving the needs of the rest of Phil Lowry's organization, including the key area of right of way acquisition and other legal requirements related to pipeline expansions.  Greg Porter's group will continue its focus on   commercial and regulatory activity on the NNG and TW systems.  Greg's group gets reinforcements on Monday, as Bill Rapp is joining us from EES.  Bill will focus on TW matters, and will coordinate closely with Tony Pryor, Maria Pavlou, and Greg and Dot as he gets up to speed on the busy TW docket.  Dot McCoppin's group will continue its role supporting all commercial and regulatory activity for Citrus/FGT.  Dot's group will also assist with TW matters as appropriate.

Given the dynamic business we are a part of and the small size of our group, the organizational structure outlined above is intended to be very flexible.  Each of us will continue to be called on by clients to assist with projects that don't fit neatly into the above structure.  That is part of the challenge we face, but also part of the fun we enjoy!  

Please join me in congratulating Colleen on her new responsibilities and in welcoming Bill to the group on Monday!

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Meditation Primer

Studies show that practicing mindfulness meditation may 
significantly reduce stress, anxiety, and depression.

One way to practice mindfulness meditation is to merely 
sit quietly for 10 to 20 minutes while concentrating on a 
single object or on the flow of your breath. When your mind 
begins to wander, note the new thought or sensation and 
then gently bring your concentration back to your original 
focus. 

RealAge Benefit: Taking care of your emotional health and 
well-being can make your RealAge up to 16 years younger.

"New Legal Team to Assist RAC","	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

Subject:	RE: Transwestern Red Rock Expansion

Keith,

	If I understand your change to the second paragraph correctly, the new compressors at Stations 1, 2 and 3 will be completed and placed into service within the one-year deadline in the FERC order. The removal of the existing units at those stations, however, will not be completed until six months after that. My general feeling is that as long as the old units are taken out of service by the one-year deadline and are no longer operational, we should be ok and don't need to ask FERC for an extension. The ordering paragraph from the FERC order requires that the new facilities be placed in service within one year from the date of the order. It does not impose a similar deadline for the abandonment of the existing facilities. I take it that we would not operate the old and the new facilities at the same time (i.e., continue to operate the existing compressors after we've installed and placed into operation the new compressors), since this would result in TW operating compression in excess of its certificated capacity. As long as we don't do that, I don't think there's any need to ask for a separate extension for the abandonment.

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

Please include the following paragraph in the TW regulatory matters Note:

On July 16, 2001 Transwestern was authorized to abandon and replace certain compressor station facilities located in Arizona (Red Rock Expansion).  The new compressor facilities will create 150,000 Mcf per day of incremental firm capacity on the western portion of Transwestern's system which terminates at the Arizona/California border.  Transwestern estimated the cost to abandon the existing units to be approximately $.4 million, and the cost to install the new units to be approximately $92.9 million.  The proposed in-service date for the Red Rock Expansion is June 1, 2002.

We need to take Andy Fastow off of our board of directors on our web site - he was the officer for our sales marketing division.  What do you think about replacing him with Cindy Olsen?  Maria

"RE: Transwestern Red Rock Expansion","Bill,

Thanks for including me.  I have no further comments or suggestions.  In fact I like the idea of requesting an extension versus deleting this portion of the project and reducing our capability to contract the remaining capacity that Station 4 provides.  Hopefully the market will step up and need this capacity prior to 2003.  Thanks again.

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

Steve,  

Earlier this month when SoCalGas filed this Advice Letter I had routed it for information.  This filing to change Rule 30 in their tariff will document the changes effectuated by SoCalGas on Nov. 1 as it relates to the elimination of Windowing.  Given our record and testimony in the GIR proceeding and the Systems Adequacy proceeding I hadn't intended to comment on this Advice Letter however I wanted to make sure you agreed with that position.

Glen and Steve:
 
The attached supplemental advice filing by SoCalGas replaces the  changes to Rule 30, Transportation of Customer-Owned Gas, proposed by AL2837.   The purpose of this filing is to  describe the new internal receipt point operating procedures that SoCalGas is  implementing, and to request Commission authorization to include the revised  operating procedures in Rule 30. SoCalGas says this step is being taken in  anticipation that it will be replaced with a system of firm tradable intrastate  transmission rights in Gas Industry Restructuring (GIR) proceeding, I.99-07-003.  
During  the GIR panel hearings, several parties requested that SoCalGas publish its  windowing criteria in tariffs to facilitate a better understanding of the method  used to allocate receipt point  capacity.  SoCalGas agreed to make  such a filing, and D.99-07-015 directed SoCalGas to file an advice letter adding  windowing information to its tariffs.  To comply with this directive, on August  6, 1999, SoCalGas filed AL2837, which has not been acted on by the Commission.  
Customer complaints about SoCalGas' windowing  procedures have convinced SoCalGas that it should replace its internal  windowing operating procedures with a system that is open to the maximum  operating capacity at each SoCalGas receipt point.  SoCalGas is making these internal  operating changes effective November 1, 2001.  SoCalGas held meetings with upstream  pipelines on October 17, and with interested customers and stakeholders on  October 18, regarding the upcoming changes.  They were invited to ask any questions in  the days leading up to the meetings. 
Comments and/or protests are due on November 21.  Have a good  weekend!

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of TW's response to the FERC data request in the USGT negotiated rate proceeding. Please note that our response to Data Request No. 1, contemplates that we will provide to FERC copies of the other bids that were received on this capacity. We could attempt to summarize this other bids, but I think the better approach is to just provide copies. 

A schedule of actual volumes transported and actual rates charged USGT is attached (this is the Schedule C that is referenced in our response to Data Request No. 4). This will need to be updated next week prior to filing. I do not have the other attachments to the responses in electronic format. I can of course provide paper copies of these to anyone who would like to see them. 

I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon on Monday, December 10. Thanks.

Morris, 

Just wanted to give you an update on the electrical supply for the ENA/Hubbard Agreement.  I spoke with Bill Rapp and he informed me that at this point we can not negotiate a backup contract with Midland Power until ENA terminates their agreement.  Bill prepared a letter to send Midland Power covering the bankruptcy which Midland Power now has in their hands.  

I also spoke with Charlie Gramm and Mark Knippa.  Mark stated that ENA is in the process of getting the past due bills current and wish to continue providing electrical power for the compression.  Mark said this payment should happen in the next couple of days.  Mark did talk to Midland Power last week and explained the situation and felt confident that they would not shut off power.  Mark also stated that by contract that if ENA can not meet their obligations that gives NNG that right to purchase power directly from Midland Power.  Mark indicated at this point ENA wants to continue with the contract.

Charlie spoke with Midland Power today and was assured that they would not cut off power prior to Dec. 15th and being that the 15th was on a weekend that they would not shut off power over the weekend.  Charlie stated that the individual he talked with at Midland Power wanted to review some information that he had just received and that they would touch base later today or no later than in the morning.

To sum it all up we should have power to at least Monday and should have some additional information later today or early tomorrow on the long term solution.

I will keep you updated and let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks 

Jeff

Will it be necessary to obtain the consent of the lenders before Transwestern may enter into any transaction with an affiliate? Are there de minimis exceptions?

Mark Knippa talked to Roger Wieck (Midland Power Cooperative) this morning and let him know that he should be receiving payment of at least October's (approx.. $88k) past due electric bill yet this week.  Mark also was to let him know that ENA plans on continuing to operate and pay the electric bill into the future.  Mark will follow-up later this week to see if the payment was made.  If I don't hear from Mark or Midland by Wednesday or Thursday, I will check with Midland to see where things are.

I think we could wind this up with a quick conference call tomorrow a.m.  Greg and I had some additional thoughts on how to handle the issue that this contract is not for 40% of primary capacity - it is not like an El Paso/Dynegy, Enron or El Paso deal without necessarily getting into the alternate issue of sham transactions.  Also, Kathy R. checked and as of today, IS have not filed a protest.  Maria

Subject:	RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding 

I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about ""Shipper Imbalances"" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order (""OFO"") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

Subject:	RE: PG&E's Gas Accord II

After reviewing the Pre-hearing conference statement, I feel that at this juncture all that may be needed is for TW to enter an appearance. I don't believe that we currently have a position as to ""whether PG&E's proposed resolution of the issues raised by parties in their protests is agreeable"" such that we could file a statement as the judge has requested. Therfore, unless someone can summarize the parties positions and their impact on TW I would suggest that we use Jeff Dasovich to file an appearance for us since that would be the least costly alternative. If anyone has other suggestions please let me know.

Subject:	PG&E's Gas Accord II

The CPUC has issued a Notice of the Prehearing Conference for PG&E's Gas Accord II  filing to be held on January 7, 2002.  Prehearing conference statements are to be filed by January 2, 2002.  You may recall that the PG&E filing in October was a request to simply extend their current rates for two additional years for the period of Jan. 1, 2003 through Dec. 31, 2004.  They based their request on the unresolved bankruptcy reorganization plan and uncertain gas markets.  

Dan Douglas provided us a summary of the filing and my recollection is that after reviewing the filing and his summary we were of the opinion that the rate extension probably would have minimal impact on TW however their reorganization plan to convert their backbone system to an interstate pipeline via a filing at FERC could certainly have an impact.  In that regard, Jeff Dasovich has scheduled a conference call on January 8th with PG&E to discuss their FERC filing and TW will be participating in that call.  

Given our initial reaction to this filing, to what extent do we want to particiapate in this proceeding and do we want to use Dan?  At minimum we had intended to have Dan file a prehearing statement for us.  However given our cash concerns, before calling Dan I wanted to make sure we were still on the same track.  Below is the link to the Prehearing Notice.  gh

If enough of us want to go (must be at least 20) I I can coordinate a group and hopefully, get us really good seats at a bit of a discount.  I plan to shoot for a Sunday matinee.  Meanwhile, I'm going to get exact ticket prices, etc.  I do know that this event is in great demand and that the orchestra tickets range from approximately $78 to $131.  I will also get prices for other parts of Jones Hall.

Also, I am planning to look at Sunday dates in August.

Be so kind as to shoot me an e-mail so that I'll have an idea how many tickets would be involved.

Subject:	Transwestern Credit Agreement

Steve and Kim,

	I spoke with Drew after the staff meeting today regarding what limitations would be imposed by the new credit agreement on Transwestern's dealings with its affiliates, most notably ENA/EWS. Drew said that this and a number of other issues are still being negotiated and that it's not yet clear where we'll wind up. Obviously, we'll try and negotiate as much flexibility on the affiliate issue with the banks as possible. Drew indicated that the agreement should be finalized in the next day or so and that he would issue guidance on this and other issues as soon as it is.

Subject:	Transwestern Response to FERC Data Request - USGT Negotiated Rate Filing

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of TW's response to the FERC data request in the USGT negotiated rate proceeding. Please note that our response to Data Request No. 1, contemplates that we will provide to FERC copies of the other bids that were received on this capacity. We could attempt to summarize this other bids, but I think the better approach is to just provide copies. 

A schedule of actual volumes transported and actual rates charged USGT is attached (this is the Schedule C that is referenced in our response to Data Request No. 4). This will need to be updated next week prior to filing. I do not have the other attachments to the responses in electronic format. I can of course provide paper copies of these to anyone who would like to see them. 

I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon on Monday, December 10. Thanks.

"What Enron Did Right","A great editorial in the Wall Street Journal today.

Manager's Journal:
What Enron Did Right
By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the
vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires),
competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and
dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being
an icon is risky business. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from
grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.

   Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron
became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor
of conflicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles
drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements
were all a mirage.
   We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under
investigation. We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts
of interest is needed. High profitability does not justify breaking the
law or ethical norms. But no matter how the current issues resolve
themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an
enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value.


   -- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and
electric power industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open
market of bidding by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to
enter or exit. Enron was the leader in pioneering this business.

   Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S.,
and is spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have
been consumers, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen
competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The
contrary experience of California, the poster child of those who would
re-regulate the power industry, is an example of not enough
deregulation.


   -- Innovation and the ""de-integration"" of power contracts. Under the
old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were
offered a one-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system
was inflexible and inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you
can only buy manure by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that
could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer.

   To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its
constituent parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc.,
and offered customers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's
investors did too, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by
inventors. Arguably, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph
Schumpeter called the ""process of Creative Destruction."" But creative
destroyers are not necessarily likable, pleasant folks, which may be
part of Enron's problem today.


   -- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended
the logic of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper
company, for instance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper
plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run
all those disparate activities better than smaller, specialized firms.
Enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with
inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of
""customers"" and ""suppliers."" Enron envisioned creating free markets for
components within the integrated chain on the bet that the free-market
terms would be better than those of the internal operations. The
development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by which divisions
of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the
economy.


   -- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated
environment, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a
single dedicated pipeline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could
be supplied from a number of possible sources, opening the customer to
the benefits of competition, and the supplier to the flexibility of
alternative sourcing strategies. Enron benefited from controlling
switches on the network, so that they could nimbly route the molecules
or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use,
and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons. This
policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tremendous value
for both customers and suppliers.


   -- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could
easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of
the trading risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal
controls. Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we
judge to be among the best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of
Enron Online, where Enron made new positions valued at over $4 billion
each day, it became essential to have up-to-the-second information on
company-wide positions, prices and ability to deliver.

   The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading
losses by the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's
ability to finance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and
trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite,
counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance. It was the
erosion in equity, rather than trading risk, that destroyed the firm.


   -- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's
corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood
stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal,
slow, and full of excuses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline
company -- Enron only 15 years ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron
became bumptious, impatient, lean, fast, innovative, and demanding. It
bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to
start new businesses, create markets, and transfer within the firm.

   Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and
an open-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization
and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe
the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs.
This was a lightning rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could
serve as a model for more hide-bound enterprises to emulate.

   Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the
transformation of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet
corners of the business economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in
almost every area in which it did business. It thrived on volatility.

   The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D
establishment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover
following Enron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and
time-consuming antitrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to
find a way to make Enron's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all
should hope, because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to
reinvent themselves and remake their industries.

I talked to my Supervisor and here is what we can do, PNMGS will not accept or confirm any nominations under Off-System Transportation Contract T39817.  This will put the Contract in an ""INACTIVE"" status instead of total Termination of the Contract.
Prior to any  future expectation of Off-system Transportation, pursuant to Contract T39817 between PNMGS and TWPC, there will then be an updated and current determination on the Financial Responsibility as set forth under ARTICLE XII. FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.   PNMGS will then decide what, if any, steps will need to be taken prior to such Off-system Transportation.

"ELM Course Offering--Gas Business Understanding","
GAS BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING----NOVEMBER 26, 2001

An introduction to the gas industry that will address the issues that face the team daily.  Players in the market, supply/demand and many other factors are examined, including the various markets across the U.S.  The day culminates with a real-life marketing simulation. Using business concepts learned throughout the course, participants compete against each other to market their gas supply to a California electric generator.   And just as in the real world, teams can ultimately either strike it rich or lose their shorts!

For those of you who had previously added this color printer to your selections, you'll need to delete that old icon because it's totally different this time.  Here's how you delete it:

?	""Start"" (in the lower left-hand corner of your monitor)
?	""Settings""
?	""Printers""
?	Highlight the printer you want to delete (call me if you're unsure which one)
?	Press the delete button on your keyboard
?	Make sure that's the one you really want to delete, and click ""YES""

Here's how you gain access to the new one:

?	""Start""
?	""Run""
?	In the box that says ""Open:"" type in the following (without the underlining):  \\wnahou-1005919\HPColorL
?	""OK""
?	""YES""
?	This printer has now been added to your printer selections

Lee, You don't have to do anything because I already added it to your computer.

PLEASE NOTE:  If you're printing to LEGAL paper, you'll need to manually change the paper cartridge before you select print.  If you call me, I'd be happy to change the cartridge to LEGAL for you, but I ask that you change it back to LETTER once you print so that it's not an inconvenience to others.  Mucho thanks!

Call me if questions.   Thanks for you patience in getting this up and running again!  :-)

To: Parties Who Participated in the A.01-09-024 (SoCalGas and SDG&E BCAP) Meet and Confer: 
  Attached is a proposed PHC Statement as required by ALJ Brown in her Ruling of November 5, 2001.  Per that Ruling, this Statement must be filed within 10 days of our meeting (which by my calculation would be the 26th of November).  I would REALLY like to get it filed on the 21st if possible, before the Thanksgiving weekend.
  I tried to keep the Statement simple, while reflecting the consensus views articulated at the meeting.  I tried not to go into too much detail on the description of some of the outstanding CPUC proceedings that may affect this case, but wanted to give the judge some flavor for each proceeding.  I ask that each of you let me know by noon next Tuesday (the 20th) if you want to ""sign on.""  I will incorporate any non-substantive edits you may have.  For substantive edits (hopefully there will be few if any) I will do my best to incorporate.  However, let's remember that none of us want to be de-positioned by what is said in this document so argumentative statements will be ignored.  If only nonsubstantive edits are received, I will file on behalf of all participating parties without further review.  If substantive changes are made, a second review will be provided.
  I hope we can keep this from becoming an unwieldy exercise.  I ask for your cooperation and appreciate your input.  If you want to provide your individual PHC Statement, fine.  Just let me know so I can take your client's name off this one. 
Thanks again.

I would agree, as long as the payment was before Jan 1, so that they would be current before the next month flows began.    To the extent that they are not current then they do not meet the creditworthiness standards.     So as a solution to the whole thing, they pay on monday and we will forget the bad credit issue.    They pay after that and they are reported as a late payor/non-creditworthy.   It's at least a choice for them to make.

I've made a few changes as marked.  We should talk about whether or not we will accept immediate payment for the Nov. bill sufficient to bring them back to credit worthiness for their ongoing business or require them to provide additional security or Letter of Credit.  Comments?

For your info, we have received a protest and or reguest for Tech Conference or hearing from the CPUC regarding the USGT transaction starting Nov 1, 2001.  they raise the market power issue, the pricing, the volume, the policy of market based rates.  We expect a similar protest from IS, and also the issue regarding the alternate point use.  The volume on this transaction is for 400,000 per day with the negotiated rate provision only relating to the alternate path to Calif.   More to come.

Fred, Mark and Brian,

First of all, congratualations to Fred.

Second, I wonder if each of you could give ETS a litttle help.
We monitor all Enron companies to determine which companies sell gas.
We have to do this to comply with the ""Marketing Affiliate Rule.""
We think we have most of the producers, gathers and processers identified.
But, just to make sure could each of you send me a list of each of the companies you handle.
Specifically, we need the name of any of these companies in which Enron has a 10% or greater interest.
If you could identify each as a producer, gatherer or processer, it would help.
Also, we need to know whether the company sells gas at any point other than its own facilities.
Please call if your have any questions.
Thanks for your help.

Frazier King

Subject:	Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John
