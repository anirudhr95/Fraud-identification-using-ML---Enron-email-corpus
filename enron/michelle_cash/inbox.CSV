"Survey Question Review","Michelle,

Our group has been asked by EEL (Liz Barrett) to deploy the attachment survey.  We (HRGIM) would like to ensure the language of the survey is consistent with the policies and procedures of Enron Corp.  Legal (Jon Chapman) has reviewed the document.  Any insight you can provide is appreciated.

 

Regards,
Milton

P.S.  Liz Barrett's comments are below regarding the rationale behind the ethnic descriptions in the survey.

 ""I worked with Jon Chapman on the survey, so it has been comprehensively done over by legal!  The reason why I've chosen these categories are that they are the accepted categorisations by the Commission for Racial Equality, who are the governing body on race relations in the UK, and are aligned to their counter-parts in Europe.  If we do have a legal challenge, we will be asked to provide data in this fomat, rather than the US descriptors which are not as relevant to the European ethnic profile (for instance 'Hispanic' is not a meaningful category for Europe, whereas it is very significant for the US).  I'd prefer to map the US definitions onto the European ones, but to collect the European data in the CRE's format.""

"RE: lake worth project","Mike,
I know of no hold up here.  I spoke to Michelle Cash and she had not
withheld or said different to retaining this counsel.  I would suggest that
you call Michelle (713-853-6401) anytime you have a concern with regard to
the progress of any labor and employment matter handled by outside or inside
counsel.  And if Stubley is concerned about who he would like to work with
in Florida, he is equally able to call Michelle and discuss it.

As for a review of the training on union avoidance by Ogletree Deakins, by
copy to Michelle, I'll ask for her input here.

I saw the correspondence from Mr. Fitzgerald regarding his meeting with the
Mayor of Lake Worth.  I interpret this as a public official saying what is
expected, neither favoring the picketers or us, just saying he will up-hold
the law.  We appreciate that.

SCALIA CONTROVERSY COULD DELAY NLRB NOMINATIONS

Resistance in the Senate to moving on the controversial
nomination of Eugene Scalia as labor solicitor could delay
approval of nominees to the National Labor Relations Board,
GOP sources tell BNA. Senate Republicans are pushing for a
floor vote on President Bush's pick for the Labor
Department's top legal post, but several Democrats are
protesting the nomination.

Before lawmakers adjourned for the week-long Thanksgiving
recess, Senate Republicans thwarted an attempt from the
Democrats to unanimously approve the nomination of Dennis P.
Walsh (D) to the NLRB, according to a GOP aide. While
Republicans have no substantive objection to Walsh as an
NLRB member, they are insisting on a floor vote for Scalia
before other labor-related nominations are considered,
sources say.

Threats to hold up NLRB nominations are ""not going to
advance the debate"" on Scalia, according to a spokesman for
Sen. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the committee with
jurisdiction over labor-related nominees. An aide to Senate
Majority Leader Daschle (D-S.D.) tells BNA that several
Democrats who are not on the Labor Committee have expressed
concerns about Scalia and want to research his positions
before allowing his nomination to come to the floor. . . .

GEORGIA COURT OVERTURNS $45 MILLION AWARD IN BREACH OF
CONTRACT SUIT

Overturning a $45 million judgment for a sales
representative who was fired without being paid commissions,
base pay, severance pay, and company stock, the Georgia
Court of Appeals orders a new trial on damages for breach of
an employment contract but not various tort claims
(""ServiceMaster Co. v. Martin, ""Ga. Ct. App., No. A01A1093,
11/15/01). As a sanction for ServiceMaster's discovery
abuse, the trial court entered a default judgment for Ray
Martin on liability for breach of contract and tort claims.
A jury awarded Martin over $1 million in compensatory
damages, prejudgment interest, and attorneys' fees and $135
million in punitive damages. The trial court, however,
reduced the compensatory damages amount to $461,000 and the
punitive damages to $45 million.

The appeals court rules that the default resulted in
ServiceMaster admitting to all the well-pleaded allegations
in the complaint but did not bar the company from showing
that Martin could not recover on certain theories even if
the factual allegations were admitted. The appeals court
decides that the admitted facts establish the company's
liability for breach of contract but not for tortious
interference with property, breach of duty, or fraud.
Punitive damages are not available for breach of contract. .

PROSPECTS DIM FOR CHANGES TO FLSA COMPANIONSHIP EXEMPTION

Numerous concerns have been raised about a Clinton
administration proposal to broaden Fair Labor Standards Act
coverage of domestic service employees who provide certain
""companionship services,"" dimming chances for final action
on the plan. Among concerns are those raised by the Bush
Small Business Administration, which asserts that the Labor
Department did not meet its obligations under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act when it analyzed the impact the proposal
would have on small businesses. There is not ""enough
information to provide an adequate basis to support a
finding"" that the proposal would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,
the agency says

Employers in the home health care industry are stridently
resisting the change. In comments to the Labor Department,
they insist that the current regulations interpreting the
companionship services exemption are legally valid and
reflect the intent of Congress when it amended the FLSA to
provide for the exemption. However, the Service Employees
International Union, whose members include workers who
provide in-home personal care, contends that the  current
definition of companionship services is ""clearly
inconsistent"" with the FLSA because it defines such services
to ""include an unlimited amount of ordinary domestic
services."" . . . Page C-1

DOL OFFICIALS GRANTED IMMUNITY IN LONGSHORE CASE

A disgruntled marine machinist whose former employer was
challenging his entitlement to benefits under the Longshore
and Harbor Workers Compensation Act cannot sue the Labor
Department's Office of Administrative Law Judges or members
of its Benefits Review Board for rulings they made in the
course of considering the challenge, the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of California rules (""Olsen v.
Herman, ""N.D. Cal., No. 00-3165 MMC, 10/31/01). ""ALJs and
judges serving on the BRB are entitled to absolute immunity
for performing judicial acts,"" the court says. The court
also bars charges against a district director with the Labor
Department's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs who
was involved in the proceedings.

The charges were brought by Tom Olsen, who was injured while
working as a machinist aboard a vessel and awarded
compensation for permanent and total disability under the
longshore law. Olsen's former employer, Triple A Machine
Shop Inc. subsequently initiated review proceedings under
the law, claiming that Olsen's physical condition and
employment status had changed since he was awarded benefits.
The review was referred to a Labor Department administrative
law judge, a move that Olsen resisted and prompted the suit
against the DOL officials. . . . Page A-9

SEVENTH CIRCUIT NIXES OFFICER'S FREE SPEECH CLAIMS, $175,000
AWARD

A jury should not have awarded a city police officer
$175,000 on her claim that she was fired in violation of her
right to free speech, the Seventh Circuit rules, reversing a
district court's grant of judgment for Draphy Durgins in her
suit against the city of East St. Louis, Ill. (""Durgins v.
East St. Louis, "" 7th Cir.,  Nos. 00-3271, 00-3486,
11/16/01). Durgins had pressed for the discipline of two
fellow officers in a horseplay incident and subsequently was
fired for resume fraud.

Finding that Durgins failed to raise a First Amendment
Claim, Judge Easterbrook notes that communications about
personnel matters are not covered by the First Amendment.
Even if they were covered, he says, ""resume fraud is not
protected speech.""

The court also finds that Durgins's claims should have been
dismissed at the outset because she split her theories
between state and federal courts instead of seeking a
consolidated proceeding. . . . Page A-5

"various updates","While you were out, it was a bit crazed as you expected.  I'll hit some highlights for you:

Botchlett and Straub position statements: went out on Wednesday.

Chapman:  I sent the Ok. lawyer a letter and hired Lyn Mattson to investigate.  

Roome:  Spoke with Trey (we had a case against each other a while back and get along well) and sent him a letter.  Left Haedicke a message asking if we should give anyone in particular a head's up that they mentioned the SEC investigation.  He says don't need to pass along.

Anthony Sexton:  Got out that separation agreement. 

Ken Rice:  Sent Mark Haedicke a memo outlining the non-competition obligations and potential issues.  CC'd you on it.

Kitchen/Nettleton:  Further discussions with T&F, Oxley, Marcus, Tim Callaghan, etc.  Sounds like Marcus is happy.  We're getting packet for consular process out to T&F, they send to London, and we think that with some luck (depending on FBI delay on background check), January or February may hold their interviews.  Marcus decided not to switch to J&G.

RIF:  I helped out on some connected stuff, including helping Kerry with release language and speaking with counsel in Mexico so HR can determine what needs to go into calculations for analysis of shutdown of all Mexico ops.

Internet Use:  Prepared a memo for Oxley.  He hasn't responded about whether he wishes to use it.  He walked someone out the door (without talking to legal) for posting on the internet from work.

New Hire:  I did what Vance says was the final new hire orientation.  :(   We'll talk on your return about figuring out how to tell new hires what they need to know.

Hope you had a good trip and a happy Thanksgiving!

Here is the offer letter template - the offer consists of an offer letter, a term sheet and a summary of terms and conditions.  We assume that we would be obligated to pay the guaranteed minimum bonus even if the employee were laid off prior to February.  (I know a lot of non-A/A's get guaranteed minimum bonuses in their offer letters as well - the Global Compensation database  should have a comprehensive list).

I was wondering if you had read this.  You have to know that people at Enron are getting 5 ratings that do not deserve them.  There is a very big problem.  Even though my situation is not an executive situation, Enron has been my life for 14 years.  I have been a dedicated, hard-working, employee that did not in any way deserve to be forced out of a position because the bosses got along better with other individuals in the group.   I questioned procedures, and shared my knowledge, came up with better ways of doing things and look where it got me.  I was not given the recognition I deserved because of corrupt individuals that were afraid for their own jobs,  now I am leaving and they get to stay.  It looks like this is happening even at high levels.
 
I have been looking every day at postings.  It's not looking promising since I have only until November 18.

The technical questions are light and will be largely dependent on the type of asset we are pursuing (pulp or paper).  We can have the techical gurus draft their questions.  The formatting is messy but we can fix that when we complete it.  Have you sent me the info we discussed last week?  If so, as of today I haven't received it.

Mr. Lay and Dave Delainey:
 
Since, I was terminated from Enron Energy Service's on  Friday, November 16, 2001 before the Thanksgiving holiday and did  not received a check on November 30, 2001.    
 
Please advise when I will receive my vacation owe to me of  73 hours, and when I will receive my severance?   Especially  since I was terminated from my job before Enron  officially declared bankruptcy.   
 
Ashley Kerr, HR Specialist replied via  email stating that;  Per the HR Service Connection the process of paying vacation out  30 days later is to ensure that any outstanding balances owed by the employee  can be taken care of (for i.e. - any Energizer charges you have in November will  be taken out of you vacation on 12/15.)  
 
But it was not  what Ms Kerr, HR Specialist outlined in her handwriting the day I  was terminated on November 16, 2001.  She explained and outlined the dates of what amount I would  be receiving on the payroll of November 30, 2001, December 15,   December 31, 2001 and on January 31, 2001.
 
Didn't you all received a check  on November 30th?  I hope that  Fastow and Skilling didn't received any kind of payment on November  30, 2001 from Enron's payroll.  
 
I await for your response, so that I may take care  of my bills.

Hi Fran,

 

I know you must be really bogged down with  questions, so my apologies in advance for bugging you, but if you could track  down an answer for me it would be much appreciated.  

 

I am running the Houston Marathon for the Leukemia  Society.  I made a fundraising commitment of $2000.  I have raised  $1000 and have been waiting for the Enron match of $1000 from the matching gifts  program.  The request was submitted well in advance of the cutoff  deadline that was announced via e-mail a few weeks before the layoffs.  The  Leukemia Society has not yet received the match.  If Enron does not come up  with the match, I am personally on the hook for this $1000, and in light of the  small severance situation, it is going to be really tough for me right  now.

 

Do you have any information on whether or not  the Enron commitment will be honored as was communicated in the  e-mail?  Do you have any idea when the funds will be sent to the  Leukemia Society?  Any information you can provide right now will be much  appreciated, so that I can pass it along to the Leukemia  Society.  

 

Thank you,

 

Elizabeth Hutchinson

Thank you for your reply. I have been in training all day and will be there for half a day tomorrow. 
 
I did not list it on the compliance cert., because after reading the 62 page code of ethics, I felt the book was outside the parameters articulated in the book. After you came and talked to our class, I felt it was still outside the parameters but would be best to notify you so there would be no question later. (Yes, I did read the entire code of ethics!)

Hello, Michelle!
 
You came and spoke to my new hire class last Monday. I have a pending book deal with Zondervan publishing and wanted to make sure that there was no problem re the confidentiality agreement. 
 
I am certain there will be no problem. I have been a minister for 22 years and have a proposal being pitched by the senior editor at Zondervan to their editorial review board. The book will draw on my leadership/team-building experiences in the church and will be written from the perspective of a minister / mba. It will have nothing to do with Enron.
 
Please let me know when would be a good time to come by.
 
All The Best,

Subject:	PRC Process



				

	I have long thought that the PRC Process needs to be changed in order to better provide the appropriate feedback and motivation as well as rewards that a good review process should.  I hope you will consider my thoughts carefully since I have had active involvement in the process from its inception and believe that I can offer some advice that should be considered.  

	It appears that the results of the process have become too demoralizing to the employee being reviewed.  Even those that do well are suspicious of the process and don't particularly like it.  It causes a great deal of stress on employees and creates an atmosphere of cynicism among the people that should be supportive of it.  There is a belief that the process is arbitrary and that no one gets a fair hearing based on their performance but rather the results are skewed by the negotiating skills and argumentative success of any particular reviewer.  The biggest single complaint seems to be the fact that an employee can be told after one review period that they are excellent and six months later be told they are only satisfactory or worse.  While the employee's performance may have suffered during that period of time, the message that they hear is not necessarily that their performance has declined but rather that they as an individual are not valued and are not as good as they were six months earlier.  We are mixing the message between the worth of the individual and the results of their performance.  The following is my recommendation to improve on this system:

	SEPARATE THE PERFORMANCE CATEGORIES INTO THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES   

	
	1.  Employee Skill, Competency and Character  - This category measures a persons inherent skill, talent, intelligence and commitments to Enron's values.  This determinant should not change drastically between each review period since it measures whats inside a person and that should only change slowly or with the development of new skills or the hiring of new and better qualified employees.  In this category a person could be told whether they are excellent or superior or average and know that they have an opportunity to improve on that ranking through their own effort while also realizing that we are continually trying to raise the bar with new hires.  This particular performance measurement is also a measure of the success of our hiring and training program.

	2.  Employee Performance - This a measure of how well an employee is performing the tasks of any particular job.  This measure could fluctuate much more than the first since each person's performance can vary greatly over time based on many different circumstances.  This measure would also distinguish those employees who may not be considered to have the best skills or greatest intelligence but who through sheer hard work and determination are outstanding performers.  It should also help identify those who are under performing and not living up to their potential as measured by the first category.  This category also measures our skill as managers and leaders of people since it is often the managers job to motivate people to perform above and beyond their own capability.

	3.  Results - This is a measure of the financial performance and result of the effort of any individual employee.  I believe this criteria is most suited to the commercial employees and should be the major determining factor (but not the only on) in annual bonus payments.  This should be closely correlated to the Job Performance criteria but it may not always be since some people may be working on a long term project which has a payback at some future date or in the other extreme someone could have lucked out by being in the right place at the right time and gaining the benefit from it without the appropriate effort.

	In addition to these three categories I would also reduce the Job Descriptions that are included in the PRC process.  I think it is a waste of time to include clerks,  assistants, accounting personnel and other non manager commercial support people in the process.  Very little is gained by them or by management and a tremendous amount of stress and ill will is created.  I would also reduce the amount of time spent on the PRC at mid year and only focus on the first two performance categories at that time.  I would also change the time when the PRC review is done since now it happens in the summer when many people are trying to scheduled vacations and at year end when there is so much other business activity going on.  I think a March, September schedule would work much better.

	There are probably many other ideas to improve the PRC process and I am sure that you are working on them.  Please give my ideas some thought and see if they don't merit some consideration.

PAST DISCIPLINE CAN BE CONSIDERED IN REVIEW OF POSTAL
FIRING, JUSTICES SAY

In reviewing the reasonableness of a U.S. Postal Service
worker's termination for cumulative misconduct, the Merit
Systems Protection Board may consider past discipline of the
employee even if those actions are being grieved, the U.S.
Supreme Court rules, reversing a Federal Circuit decision
(""USPS v. Gregory, ""U.S., No. 00-758, 11/13/01).

Writing for the court, Justice O'Connor acknowledges that a
federal employee may be faced with a board decision that
reaches a different result than the grievance arbitrator
ultimately might reach, or never have his or her grievance
resolved because a collective bargaining agreement requires
union withdrawal of a grievance when the board issues a
final decision. There is nothing unfair in those results,
however, the court says, because a union-represented federal
employee who elects to pursue a board appeal does in fact
receive an independent review of the reasonableness of the
agency's discipline.

 Nevertheless, the court remands the case involving Postal
Service employee Maria A. Gregory--who was accused in
September 1997 of deliberately inflating an overtime
request--because one of the three minor disciplinary actions
relied on by MSPB in its ruling was decided in Gregory's
favor by an arbitrator prior to the its decision. . . . Page

SUPREME COURT LETS STAND RULING THAT UNION'S TORT CLAIMS NOT
PREEMPTED

The U.S. Supreme Court lets stand an appeals court ruling
that the National Labor Relations Act does not preempt state
law tort claims by union representatives who were detained
by a nonunion contractor for trespassing on its jobsite
(""Rainbow Constr. Co. v. Radcliffe, ""U.S., No. 01-424,
""cert. denied"" 11/13/01). Rainbow Construction Co. sought
review of a June decision by the Ninth Circuit that allowed
four representatives of the Bay Counties District Council of
Carpenters to proceed with claims of false arrest, false
imprisonment, and malicious prosecution.

The union representatives inspected various publicly
financed construction projects in Mendocino County, Calif.,
to investigate allegations that contractors were not
complying with prevailing wage and health and safety rules.
On three occasions, Rainbow made citizen's arrests of three
of the union representatives, who were then taken into
police custody. The county district attorney prosecuted all
four officials for criminal trespass. California trespass
law does not allow property owners to exclude persons
engaged in lawful union activity. The Ninth Circuit decided
California's interests in protecting its citizens were
sufficient to avoid preemption. . . . Page AA-2,  Text E-1

IOWA MAYTAG WORKERS END STRIKE AFTER ACCEPTING THREE-YEAR
CONTRACT

Workers return to Maytag's Middle Amana, Iowa, manufacturing
plant after voting to accept a new contract, effective
immediately and running until September 2004. The vote ends
a seven-week strike by some 1,800 employees represented by
the Machinists at the refrigerator and microwave oven
manufacturing plant.

The new contract addresses three issues that prompted the
strike: mandatory overtime; a two-tiered wage system; and
health insurance premium increases. Ed Miller, business
representative for IAM Local 1526, says although union
members are not entirely satisfied with the changes, they
approved the contract in the belief it was the best that
could be achieved this year. The union recommended approval
of the pact. According to Miller, the contract calls for an
hourly pay increase of $1.47 over term, with a 60-cent raise
this year, 46 cents next year, and 41 cents in late 2003.
Average pay at the plant is currently $14.40 per hour. New
hires will receive 80 percent of the previous minimum pay
and will not reach the top of the pay scale as quickly as
under the previous contract.

Maytag proposed increasing mandatory overtime to 12 hours
per week per worker, but the union was able to keep it to
eight hours per week per employee, Miller says. Union
negotiators were less successful in addressing their
concerns with health insurance, and the new contract
includes both higher premiums in the last year of the
contract and reduced benefits. A Maytag spokesman says the
company is pleased with the contract agreement. . . . Page

HIGH COURT REFUSES TO CONSIDER VICARIOUS LIABILITY FOR
SEXUAL HARASSMENT

The U.S. Supreme Court refuses to review an appeals court's
decision upholding a jury's verdict that a mine owner was
vicariously liable for sexual harassment because the company
failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent the harassment
of a female miner by her male boss (""Eddy Potash Inc. v.
Harrison,  ""U.S.,  No. 01-383,  ""cert. denied,"" 11/13/01).

Eddy Potash Inc., which operated an underground potash mine
near Carlsbad, N.M., asked the justices to overturn the
Tenth Circuit's decision to affirm a jury's finding for
Jeanne Harrison. In this case's second trip to the Supreme
Court, Eddy Potash urged the court to revisit its decisions
in """"Faragher v. Boca Raton"""" and ""Burlington Indus. Inc. v.
Ellerth"" because, it argued, those decisions did not address
whether an employer should be held vicariously liable for
sexual harassment by a supervisor where both the employer
and the employee have acted reasonably. . . . Page AA-3,

WORK CHANGES AFTER HARASSMENT CHARGE JUSTIFY TRIAL ON
RETALIATION CLAIM

A Philadelphia Housing Authority worker can proceed to trial
with her claim of illegal retaliation under Title VII of the
1964 Civil Rights Act, based on her allegations that she was
given additional work and shift changes after participating
in the sexual harassment complaint of a co-worker  (""Jenkins
v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, ""E.D. Pa., No. 00-CV-609,
10/24/01).

Monique Jenkins established ""sufficient evidence of a
possible causal link"" between her claim of the job changes
and her protected activity under the federal civil rights
law to warrant a trial, Judge Buckwalter of the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
holds.

Although dismissing Jenkins' other claims against her
employer, the court finds that comments from some of her
supervisors, who referred to her as a ""snitch"" and ""not a
team player,"" support her allegation of retaliation. . . .

"Y/E PRC and Contractual Bonus Targets","Michelle,

Can you and the comp team help us identify who has contractual bonus targets for performing at the top 25%, 33% or 50% of the PRC ""criteria"" or ""performance scale"".

Obviously we have a number of contracts we entered into between Jun 99 and the beginning of the end of last year which have some sort of wording along the above lines in them. There are some critical questions I would like to get clarity on:

If BU's and support functions simply stop at 10/80/10 in their PRC's how will we deal with these contracts?
Presuming all commercial staff are also relative ranked for bonus purposes separately to the PRC, can we use this scale instead (where it will be easier to identify a to half or quartile performance).
Do we need to ensure that BU's and Functions that have people with such wording do split their middle 80%. If so how should we do this?
Do we need to amend those contracts to wording that is easier to interpret?
What proof or disclosure will we need to those individuals with this wording?

I have a PRC committee meeting Thurs and while I don't anticipate raising this issue in that forum, I'd like to know we are working on a solution.

David

Pls. let me know if you have any questions.

Today, Jeff Donahue requested that Frank Stabler's termination date, as reflected in his separation agreement, be extended from 12/01/01 to 12/31/01 due to his support on the CEG/CEG-RIO divestiture.  If approved, Michelle could you please generate a 2nd amendment to Frank's separation agreement.

Alan 

I just spoke with YH Jo of Kim & Chang. He advises that payment of salaries to employees of ECT Korea Branch will not attract any liability to the branch representative (ie. John Nowlan) notwithstanding that there may not be enough funds to meet all liabilities.

Tiong Hock is still checking on what other liabilities the branch has but his initial impression is that they are mostly inter company debts.

I will double check the  position with PWC Korea when I speak with them later with Chor Lim and Anthony.

Here is the updated memo.  You might have someone review it before you start
using it, especially the part in red.  I wouldn't want anyone to perceive
that you or I are doing anything to discourage students from considering
Enron as their first choice.  I think it does need to be addressed, as I'm
sure you will be asked this with increasing frequency in the upcoming
months.

"RM Simulation Storyline Scripts - Ready for Legal Review","Michelle
Here are my very minor comments. However we still need to wait on any additions, based on meeting with SME's today. One concern is the firing of the learner who performs  bad in the final two scenarios. Do we face any copyright issues using the CNN type themes? In addition, I think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like California or anything that really happen with Enron? (i.e. So-cal Waha) In addition, comments on regulatory issues may be a problem (i.e. California Legislature).

Sheri

When you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. Thus I do believe we need to maybe use a ""Dateline"" type theme for one, and a ""60 Minute"" type theme for another scenario vice just the CNN type theme. In the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers (i.e. title change to manager)?

Kirk -

I have combined all of the storyline scripts (Intro and Scenarios 1-7) for
you to send to Legal for their review. Your comments were incorporated in
the scripts for scenarios 1 and 2.  We decided to refer to the company as
both Energy Incorporated and Energy Inc. rather than using E.I. so that
there is no confusion with Enron International. We will not have a coach
exit for scenario 5 until EOD tomorrow after the Ed meeting.  In reference
to your concern over ""locking in a price"" as collusion, those were
Phillip's words but we hope Legal will decide if we need to change them.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Karen,

Thanks for taking the time to discuss the confidentiality agreement pertaining to the ENA Trading Track.  As discussed, I am following up with a couple of questions regarding the contents of the agreement, specifically item 1.2.  From what I gather, the agreement very broadly covers the financial industry and I wanted to list a few scenarios to see if they are included or not included by the agreement.
- Non energy, non commodity based private equity firms
- Non energy-sector coverage within a mutual fund company
- Non derivatives based hedge fund
- Non energy based investment banking
- Equity research in with non-energy or commodity industry coverage

Please let me know for each of the above what is included and excluded.

Regards,

Gary Linhart

"Enron v. Miller","
Dear  Michelle:
 
     On Tuesday, October 23, I met with Christina Solomon, counsel for Doug  Miller.  The elusive Liz Miller failed to attend, having been called at the  last minute into an all-day meeting.  We have tentatively agreed that we  will meet next week.
 
     Despite Liz Miller's absence, I believe that the meeting was productive.  I  learned the following information:
 
     1.    Doug Miller claims that there are three power grids that  are unrelated, that he worked only in the East for ENA and works only in Texas  for Calpine.  Thus, he claims that his duties and activities do not overlap  in any way with those he performed for ENA.
 
     2.    Calpine did not know of Miller's non-compete at the time  Miller was hired because he believed it had expired.  He brought it to  Calpine's attention immediately upon being contacted by ENA.
 
     3.    Christina argued, as she did in the answer and  counterclaim, that the non-compete agreement was fatally overbroad, as Miller  never had any duties involving the majority of the activities from which the  non-compete purports to bar him. 
 
     In response, I told her the following:
     
     1.    We do not accept Miller's assertion that simply working in  another region will sufficiently insulate our trade secrets, since strategies  may not be confined to a single region.
 
     2.    I pointed out to her that Miller's contract very clearly  states that the non-compete extends three months after employment even if the  contract term has expired.  I also pointed out that he was reminded of his  non-compete orally several times by ENA personnel upon his  resignation.
 
     3.    I explained that the non-compete had been enforced on many  occasions and that it was carefully crafted with an eye to protecting the many  trade secrets to which Miller may have had access.  I argued that  strategies concerning one aspect of ENA's business might impact many other areas  and that, as such, the non-compete was not overly broad.  [She asked what  trade secrets we were trying to protect!!  I, of course, declined to  answer.]  Despite the fact that I believe that these facts are clearly  stated in our petition, she confessed to not having viewed the situation from  the ""trade secret perspective.""    
 
     We ended the meeting with her stating that Calpine and Miller were both  interested in trying to resolve the matter and that she welcomes a proposal from  us.  While she did not elaborate, I believe that they would entertain a  suggestion of some sort of limitation on his activities for some short  period of time.
 
     Please let me have your thoughts about this matter.   Thanks.
 
Best  regards,
Linda  Broocks

Mark/Cindy:

  Trying to follow events from afar.  These are tough times for all but 
don't give up.
  I understand from HR that payouts under the terms of executive employment 
agreements (such as mine with Enron Expat Services) are still a possibility. 
  Would appreciate your best efforts to see that happen.  As you know, I did 
not ask to replace Bruce Wrobel as CEO at EnCom rather I was asked by the 
Company and felt it my duty. I extended by initial 2 year assignment in 
accepting the post when otherwise I would have returned to Houston and 
retired in July.
  I hear the deferred comp plans have been caught up in bankruptcy 
proceedings. To not receive my executive agreement payout would be a double 
whammy at a time when I have two high schoolers taking the SATs for college. 
  At 55 with few prospects of finding work, I am having to bear living costs 
in Tokyo, while getting my gets through the school year.
  You can imagine my chagrin when I learned of the $55MM retention bonus 
payout while I have no payout under my executive agreement nor any 
severance.  Your best efforts on my behalf would be appreciated.  And hang 
in there.

We have reviewed the trust document and appendices.  Our proposed changes
to the Trust are attached.  We have no changes to the appendices.

As we discussed earlier today, there are two other documents that we will
require to establish the account: 1) Authorized Signers who can direct
Wachovia as Trustee (form attached) and 2) evidence of authority to
establish the trust (I have attached a very generic form that can be
modified).  These forms will not be required to open the trust tomorrow,
but are required documentation

On the issue of tax payments, Pam and I discussed W-2 wages vs. K-1
ordinary income, and you have indicated that these payments will be W-2
income.  As a follow-up item, we would like your counsel to write a letter
to us confirming that this is the proper distribution method for this
trust.  In very short order, we will need detailed payment data so that we
can begin setting up the first payments up for distribution on January 4,
2001.  Should these be W-2 distributions (wages), we will also need to know
the Employer FICA amounts.

Please also confirm the number of affiliates listed in Appendix C (3, I
believe), and Participants/Payments in Appendix B so that I can finalize a
fee quote by morning to include in Appendix D.

Please do not hesitate to call me at home this evening at (336) 712-9598 if
you would like to discuss any of this.

Subject: Question on Employement Contract


Why do lawyers at Enron not return calls from ex-Enron employees.  I would just like a clarification on an employement contract that ended a year ago.  Unfortunately it has a clause stating a non-compete of 90-days from when I resign from Enron.  My supposed contact is Michelle Cash.  Thank you in advance for your response.

Attached are the revised EEO and Harassment Prevention policies, and links for all policies.  Lizzette, I noted that you placed a question mark next to the ""Unlawful (under FMLA)"" link.  It is my understanding that the FMLA policy narrative and the related links are going to be revised/updated by Kriste Sullivan and Chris Rahaim.  In our last Project N-Form meeting, we agreed that Kriste and Chris would communicate their changes to Anne Labbe and Sarah Zarkowsky (members of the Content team).

Please let me know if you have additional changes.  Thanks again for your assistance!

Dear Pam/Michelle/Mary Joyce,
 
I have not heard anything from Mr  Lay'soffice yet as a response to the email I sent last week. I am very sorry we have come to this but I have already contacted law firms in Braziland Houstonto evaluate my options for enforcing my contractual rights. I understand Enron is in a difficult situation but the payments were due and the invoice was sent long before Enron got into the present problems. This course of action is not what I want,especially given the fact that there is a serious risk this may become public in Brazil, causing additional unnecessary problems to Enron.
 
Once the lawyers come up with a recommended course of action, and out of respect for Enron and Mr Lay, I will place an additional call informing you and Mr Lay's office of the actions that will be taken. This should take place this week.
 
Please let me know immediately if you hear anything regarding the authorization of the payment. Also please acknowledge receipt of this email.
 
Best regards and once more thank you for trying to resolve this with me over the last few weeks.
 
Diomedes Christodoulou.

"FW: FW: Severance","Okay, now that I have re-read this and understand what Pat is suggesting, the answer is no we (benefits) can't speak to past practices since we were never part of the past practice.  What I need you to do is assist to make sure that the new practice planned that is being applied by Irma Alvarez's group is consistent with the plan document.  As you and I have discussed, we need to take this in the form of an administrative guideline to the admin. committee for them to bless as well.  

The various heads of HR and the legal group who worked with each HR person on severance will have to speak to past practice.  

As it relates to service, I would like you and Pat to have a discussion about the break in service rules and the interpretation of the word severance in the plan.  If Pat can't help, try Carol Jewett.   Benefits (and its ERISA attorney) need to provide the interpretation of the plan document for those that administer the plan.  We need to do everything possible to help everyone with the development of a tool that accurately calculates the plan benefits per the plan document.  If the document is lacking then we need to fix it (ASAP).  I am not a believer in vague language that is subject to multiple interpretations.

Michelle, since the Plan is not administered centrally, it can be a challenge to learn what past practices were, especially if they differed from different work groups.  I've have always recommended centralized administration because an ERISA plan is required to be administered uniformly and consistently in similar circumstances.   
One place to check about past practices is Cynthia Barrow's group.  You may not know what all past practices were until the conclusion of discovery related to litigation.   
I don't know what past practices were, but I would start with Cynthia's group which I view as the source and reference point as to what the recommended practices should be.

Per the file, I see a separation agreement that you drafted that indicates the Company will pay for the London apartment through April 30, 2001.  I suggest that be removed since he was asked in May to vacate the apartment.  The lump-sum payment specified at the time was $350,000.  Mary has that changed?  If not, then the calc. would be $350,000 less what he owes on outstanding expense reports which would be $230,505 so for a net payment of $119,495.

This does not address whether he ultimately agreed to reimburse Enron for the tax advances.

Michelle,

The Coal group has a question related to personnel they would acquire from Vulcan if they purchased the marketing rights to their coal.    In this scenario, there are 4 marketing employees which would come to Enron as a part of the deal.   A few things:

In this case, I'm assuming these employees would resign from Vulcan and Enron would extend the appropriate offer.
Secondly, Enron's purchase of the marketing rights will be for an 18mo to 3 year trial period. At the end of the trial period, if Enron returns the marketing rights to Vulcan (or current owner), they want the right to re-call these employees.  George McClellan is ok with the right to recall, but I am not sure how/where to put this in writing ie; in the deal agreement, offer letter, etc.

Thanks,
Shanna

Michelle,
 
Gee, not sure if you've gotten this lovely little bit o' Houston trivia  making its way on the web.  But sure is funny and a nice commentary on how  we use Powerpoint presentations to do just about everything  today.
 
Hey, sent you a Christmas card, um, to your parent's address.  Gee,  where did I put your new address? Want to send it on over for next  year??
 
Unfortunately, won't get to see you in Houston this year b/c, gasp, my  parents are coming to California!  It's gonna be the whole family plate -  Mom, Dad, Laura, Mary and I.  Add Ben and his mom and it's going to be a  terrifying holiday.  Don't you wish you were  here???
 
Karin Snelson might come down, but not sure she wants to join us.   Shoot.
 
Hope all is well with you.  I realize work must just be nuts.   Wishing you a bit o' peace there, too.
 
Cheers,
Suzy
 
PS - just gave notice here at work (a good story, detailed in my  Christmas card), so from now on, it's best to use my personal email (which I  actually  might start checking), which is  suzannethomas@yahoo.com

Subject:	Draft ENE OTC Memo Re. y/e PRC

Spoke with Delainey this morning he suggested I draft below and send to him and Greg. Can you help critique (in particular I think this is too detailed);


******************************************************************************************************************************

To: All ENE employees (bar EEL)
From : ENE OTC
Re: Year-end Performance Evaluations, Promotion Nominations, PRC Meetings and Annual Bonus process.

Many employees have been asking questions related to the above and some have asked for further clarification of the changes announced in the Lay it on the line survey results memo relating to the PRC. In this regard and particularly in mind of the significant business matters we must attend to over the next couple of months, we hope the following summary of the above related processes will provide everyone with a clearer picture of how each of these processes will be handled, why, when and by whom.

Performance Evaluations
The ENE OTC believe strongly that all employees should receive a written evaluation summarizing their achievements over the last 6 months, illustrating successes and constructive areas for development and opportunity. It is our intent that this should not replace day to day communication, coaching and feedback to all employees by supervisors, it is an important formal appointment we expect all Enron business units and functional areas to meet. 

Summary of Process			Timeframe				Applicable to	 		Notable changes from the past

PEP the 360 degree, intranet		1. System opens November 9		ALL full, part/reduced time	None	
enabled feedback system will		2. System closes November 30		employees, who joined 
drive the process as follows:		3. Final evaluations are due		Enron prior to October 1, 
1. EE's will select up to 7 		no later than January 31, 2002		2001.
Reviewers they have work with
over last 6 months. These should
be a reasonable selection of
direct reports, peers and managers.
2. Their Supervisor will discuss and
possible edit the above list with them
before approving on-line for distribution.
3. Recipients of f/b requests are
notified electronically and may decline
if they feel they have insufficient data.
4. Managers collate the feedback and
prepare a summarized final performance
evaluation form balancing their views
with those received on-line and setting
any appropriate objectives for next 6
months.

Training for the on-line PEP 360 degree tool will be available from ........................... contact ............. to register. A helpdesk is also available for employees to call with any questions ext...................


PRC Meetings and Promotion nominations
The lay-it-on-the-line survey response outlined our desire to make some changes to the PRC process. As a management team, we believe strongly in the value of regular discussions surrounding what performance and skills are currently valuable, on a relative basis where are they being demonstrated most, who is ready to assume a greater role in the organization and where are they currently deployed. Equally, regularly questioning areas where overall performance may have been disappointing is also critical. Continuing this process is core to our desire to maintain a meritocractic culture and identify new opportunities for employees. In this regard, the ENE OTC has directed Business Units and Functional areas to undertake a very limited number of discussions to focus on the following:

Summary of Process			Timeframe			Applicable to	 		Notable changes from the past
1. Each BU/Functional area will		1.Meetings held between	Analyst, Associates		1. No preferred distribution
conduct a single discussion to		December 1 and 15th		all Manager and above		2. Process not linked to employees feedback
identify it's top 10% and bottom		2. VP/MD promotion		titles employed prior to		(ie no label attached to evaluation document)
10% against the following, criteria:	discussion mid Dec.		July 1, 2001. All other 		3. No longer prime driver of bonus process
Leadership potential							ee's not required to go   		4. Primary purpose; to identify and agree 
Teamwork								thru this forum, promotion	candidates, leadership candidates, 
Enron Intrinsic skills and qualities					recommendations by		deployment of talent within BU's/Functions.
BU/Functional area specific measures				supervisor to BU OTC		5. No prescribed outcome to either top 10%
2. Promotion nominations up to Snr Director				or Functional lead for approval.	or bottom 10%.
decide by each BU/Functional area.									6. No cross calibration of employees outside
3. Attendee's of meetings to be each									BU/Functional area.
BU/Functional areas management team. 									7. Discussions held by each Management team
4. Results of meetings reviewed with ENE								not ""committee"".
OTC.													
5. Management committee meeting to
discuss and agree VP and MD promotion
candidates submitted from each area.

Additional information will follow from each of your BU OTC's or Functional leads regarding the details. Initial plans discussed with the senior management teams indicated no more than 22 meetings in total, which compares with over 200 at the mid year.



Annual Incentive Plan and Equity Award process
The Executive Compensation Committee of the Board will review and agree an appropriate Bonus and Equity pool for eligible employee's in January 2002, based on recurring earnings and in line with the plan. The ENE OTC will allocate this appropriately to each BU and Functional area based on unit perfromance against plan and competitive market data obtained from our external consulting partners. Given our strong pay for perfromance culture, these annual awards are a key element of the Enron compnesation arrangements, with a clear correlation to the Company's overall perfromance against plan, each indivdiual areas perfromance against plan and each individuals contribution. We and the board are committed to ensure our key employees are paid appropriately:

Summary of Process and Timeframe			Applicable to	 		

1. Each area allocated initial				All full part/reduced time employees
Bonus/Equity pools Jan 4, 2002.				as of November 1, 2001.
2. Human Resources provides
quidelines for individual targets
based on market data.
3. Each area recommends payments
to ENE OTC by Jan 11, 2002.
4. ENE OTC reviews numbers and
recommends pool to Board Jan
24, 2002.
5. Employees receive notification
of any awards Jan 28 thru Feb 8, 2002.
6. Cash bonuses scheduled for
payment week of February 8, 2002.
7. Equity awards scheduled for 
approval by board week of Jan 18, 2002.
 


It is our design to reduce significantly the burden of these processes on our personnel, ensure that all understand

Jenny - Enron Human Resources and the Competitive Analysis Group, in coordination with General Counsel, request IT assistance for an ongoing, sensitive project involving numerous outside firms.  In conjunction with Enron Corporate policy, we have requested your group, via Keith Dziadek, generate periodic Call Detail Records (CDRs) involving outside telephone numbers of interest and to log visits to specific URLs.  We have also requested MailSweeper assistance, via Bob McAuliffe and Chris Behney, for the related outside e-mail addresses.  We have already provided a significant list of these numbers, URLs and addresses and will periodically update this list in the days to come.  The duration of this effort is likely to continue for several more weeks.  Thank you in advance for your support and please give myself or one of the principals above a call should you have any questions.  Thanks again, Rus

To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading activities, Enron Wholesale Services (""EWS"") has recently revised its official Policies and Procedures Regarding Confidential Information and Securities Trading (""Policies and Procedures"").  These revisions reflect two major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow process, the ""Review Team"" will play a more centralized role, so that the role of the ""Resource Group"" is no longer necessary.You are required to become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures.  The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department.  Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:
 http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp 
 
If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised Policies and Procedures.  If you have not certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so within two weeks of your receipt of this message.

Jordan,
 
I think this looks good.  There is one other area that you may want to include:  Develop relationships with governmental agencies that enforce discrimination/affirmative action laws, regulations, and Executive Orders.  
 
I have been taking the lead on this, with support from Steve Kean and Cindy, but we are just starting the effort this month.  Steve and I will meet with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs this week, and I am hoping to meet with the head of the OFCCP (and, perhaps folks with EEOC in Washington) later in the month.  I believe that cordial, cooperative relationships with these agencies can be invaluable in our diversity efforts.
 
If you choose to include this activity, it probably would belong in the Communication or Resources sections (it could be included in the section on creation of external relationships).
 
Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Michelle

Attached is the revised summary of the recommendations coming out of the Diversity Subcommittee.  If there are additional comments, please feel free to pass them on.

Is is also my understanding that Jeff is working with Andrea and Michelle regarding the ""metrics'' accumulated with respect to diversity performance with a focus on verification, context, and presentation so as to supplement our recommendations.  In that regard (and after discussing with Kirk), we should begin organizing a formal presentation for the OTC of these materials.  One approach may be as follows:

(1) Convert the Recommendations and Metrics into approximately 5 slides: (a) Slide 1-Overview; (b) Slide 2-What type of data was used as support and why; (c) Slide 3-  Presentation of the metrics and what we believe that data is indicating; (d) Review of Recommendations/Action Items and the supporting Business Case; and (e) Next Steps.

(2) Identify and present key metrics; identify backup slides with data points. 

I am hopeful that we can finalize these items in the next week so we can review with Cindy in early October and be prepared to meet with the OTC sometime in October.

Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.  Thank you for your time. 

Jordan

Subject:	RE: A few questions about the scripts

Mary, based on the most current information:  
1.	A&B employees will receive bonus consideration however the amount is not dependant or determined by their A / B designation.   Accordingly, any mention of bonus in the scripts will need to rely on what we have said in the past, I.E. Bonus will be dependant on financial performance and employee contributions over the past year.  
As result of this interpitation, Bonus, albeit a element of retention, should not be included as an inducement to retention at this time.  (source - Aaron Brown) 
2.	The employees on the D - list are being placed on paid furlough and being terminated at a known date in the future.  That period of earning calculated to be a severance plan offset.   Employees who work up to their specific term date ( C-list) will be receiving their normal pay; then their severance pay, without a severance plan offset.  Michelle Cash is working with Pat Mackin to define the severance plan features that will govern this timing and the corresponding explanations.

"Employment Tax Refund Project","Michelle,

As I indicated in my voice mail this morning, I am working with Janice
Priddy, Manager of Enron Corporate Payroll, on a significant employment tax
refund project.  We are in the process of quantifying potential FICA,
federal unemployment and state unemployment tax refunds related to both
internal and external acquisitions involving employees.  Essentially, if we
are able to determine that the predecessor company had beneficial
unemployment tax rates, we may be in a position to either retroactively or
prospectively take advantage of those rates.  In addition, mid-year
transactions may also result in a refund of amounts paid by Enron in excess
of certain federal and state wage bases (Enron may be entitled to take
credit for those wages paid by the acquired company prior to, but during
the same calendar year, as the transaction).

We obtained Enron Corporate Data Sheets from Kate Cole and Deborah Korkmas
was designated as a legal contact related to several external acquisitions.
We have prepared a short, one page questionnaire, which will assist us in
determining whether a significant refund opportunity exists related to
these particular acquisitions.  According to the Corporate Date Sheets,
Deborah is the legal contact for the following acquisitions:

2000 - Garden State Paper Company, LLC (FEIN: 94-3371710)
2000 - KUCC Cleburne, LLC (FEIN: not listed)
2000 - Tenaska IV Partners, Ltd. (FEIN: not listed)
2000 - Harrier Power Corporation (FEIN: not listed)

Please complete the attached questionnaire for each acquisition with as
much information as possible.  If the acquisition did not involve
employees, just complete the top portion of the questionnaire and answer
questions 1 and 2.  In reference to question 5, since it is unlikely that
you have access to such detailed payroll information, if you could provide
the states in which the predecessor had employment, we will then be in a
position to contact state agencies to gather more detailed information.

Thank you for your assistance in this process.  If you have any questions,
please call me at (713) 237-5346 or Janice at x37839.  Once the
questionnaires have been completed, please return them to me via e-mail at
alexa.r.cutter@us.andersen.com.

Sincerely,

Alexa

"Potential HR Matter","
	Todd Menzing called me up a few days ago to ask if he could send a letter to me about what I understand to be his representation of a former Enron employee against us in an HR matter.  I hadn't heard from him, so I followed up today and learned that he had or was going to send a letter to you.

	Menzing is a former V&E associate.  He called me because he knew me from a case in which V&E was representing a party in a commercial litigation matter, and I was representing an Enron employee in a deposition in that matter.

	Maybe there is an easy, no-brainer answer to what appears to be a potential disqualification issue for both Menzing and his firm (remember the mad cow disease of legal ethics? ) but if you were not already aware of Menzing's prior employer, I thought I'd let you know.

FYI re:  equity grants/phantom equity grants for NuTec and related companies.  Any equity-type grants must go to the Enron Board Compensation Committee for approval, which is not simply a rubber stamp.  There must be significant justification as to why such a plan is necessary.  Do you want to let John know about this, or should I?

I have not addressed the equity/phantom equity in the employment agreement, because I believe that more appropriately belongs in some sort of grant agreement, as indicated by the required Board approval.

Michelle, 

This email confirms our discussion that one of the mandates of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Enron is that they approve all formations of and grants related to any subsidiary equity or phantom equity plans.

Mary and I can and will work closely and quickly with any group needing to get this done.  Mary is responsible for presenting the plan for approval to the Compensation Committee after Tax, Legal, Accounting, Commercial and HR interests are scrubbed.

These types of plans have accounting, legal and tax complexities that need to be worked out and change regularly.  Also, it is very important that no written or verbal promise related to equity grants before Compensation Committee approval is obtained.

Regards, 
Aaron

David,

For clarification, I was present during Mark Stubley's brief training
session over the phone.  I memorialized the key points in a summary email.
Let me know if you or anyone else would like a copy of it.

On the issue of Ogletree training, I had mentioned that it might be more
cost efficient to have someone in Florida conduct the training.  Mike had
indicated a preference to use Mark Stubley at Ogletree.  Of course, since
Mark has done it for us in the past, I am ok with him doing it as well.  I
just was looking at the outside expenditures, as we all have been doing
lately (particularly outside counsel bills), and thought that there may be
some cost savings.  In some circumstances, outside counsel who have to
travel cut their rates a bit for travel time (don't know if Stubley does
that), so the cost differential could be minimal, but I thought I'd raise it
since there are qualified attorneys in Florida who could assist in that
arena.

I'll give Mark a call to finalize the issue of local counsel, which I do not
believe to be significant.  Because Mark has contacted them, they already
have run a conflict check and are ready to go.  All it would take to get
them ""engaged"" would be a phone call.  There should not be any cost incurred
at this point, because they only are on standby, so I think it is good to
line them up.  I'll let you know if Jim Derrick has any issue with their
recommendation.  I also have received recommendations for top-notch local
labor counsel in Florida if we choose to go that route.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Michelle

Mike,

I know of no hold up here.  I spoke to Michelle Cash and she had not

withheld or said different to retaining this counsel.  I would suggest that

you call Michelle (713-853-6401) anytime you have a concern with regard to

the progress of any labor and employment matter handled by outside or inside

counsel.  And if Stubley is concerned about who he would like to work with

in Florida, he is equally able to call Michelle and discuss it.

As for a review of the training on union avoidance by Ogletree Deakins, by

copy to Michelle, I'll ask for her input here.

I saw the correspondence from Mr. Fitzgerald regarding his meeting with the

Mayor of Lake Worth.  I interpret this as a public official saying what is

expected, neither favoring the picketers or us, just saying he will up-hold

the law.  We appreciate that.

                I forwarded our recommendation for local counsel to Michelle

Cash. She

                indicated that Enron might want to use another firm. In the

meantime, we

                will continue to use Cole Fitzgerald.  On September 24, I

copied you (as

                well as Michelle Cash and David Lund) on Cole's

correspondence concerning

                his meeting with the mayor of Lake Worth. So, his

connections should prove

                helpful.

                Lund has provided me a copy of NEPCO's subcontract. Our

review and comments

                should be complete by Friday.

                We conducted the quick, over-the-phone training for the

management team at

                Lake Worth approximately two weeks ago.  We agreed to

conduct on-site

                training when more of the project management team is present

at the site. No

                specific time is scheduled.

                We have not received a plat for the project. We have not

determined the gate

                setup. We have determined, however, that all construction

traffic and

                deliveries would use the southern gate, not the main gate to

the facility.

    RE: PLANETFEEDBACK REFERENCE NUMBER 1177072

Dear Mr. Skilling,

I'd like to bring your attention to a complaint I have with your company's overall experience. I know you appreciate your customers and want to keep them happy, so I am certain you'll want to address this quickly. This incident has infuriated me.

Here's the problem: How DARE you treat your former employees the way you have in the last three weeks!!!  To throw employees who have devoted their lives to make your company great out on the street with no severance and trying to get out of the WARN act is a disgrace.

We were told to wait out the bankrupty, and you would be petitioning the court for a severence in addition to the measly $4500 we received.  It's been like pulling teeth to get information about our termination date, unemployment, insurance, and all of our unanswered questions.  And to top it all off, you gave YOURSELVES $58 million dollars in BONUSES!  Meanwhile, there are former employees out there that have lost their entire retirement, kids who aren't getting a Christmas this year, and families having to sell their homes.  How do you sleep at night?!?!?!

My situation isn't as bad as some, but I got screwed nonetheless.  With only a year of experience, all at Enron, I'm having an EXTREMELY hard time competing with the talented Enron exes.  I have a wedding in six months, student loans, a car note, credit card debt, and I was FOUR DAYS AWAY from closing on a new house that I can't get anymore because I don't have a job.  Frivilous, maybe, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do now with no benefits and desperately trying to fight depression, which doesn't make this any easier.

I hope the bankruptcy court

Here's what I'd like to see happen: Just pay all the employees you've laid off since November the severance you kept telling us we would get.  That and any outstanding monies that the $4500 didn't cover (this includes payment for our unused vacation time!!!).

We will NOT let you get away with this.

My overall experiences with your company have been extremely negative. This incident has discouraged me. I definitely won't recommend you to any of my family or friends.

Again, I am sure you are interested in satisfying your customers, so I hope you'll move quickly on this complaint. Thanks.

Sincerely,
Meredith Stewart

"RE: Weigle EEOC File","Michelle,
We may reap the most benefit by having all the site HR Managers, Site Safety
Supervisors/Nurse Practitioners, Mike Indivero, Tony Bolar Softich(Safety),
Steve Olenik(Safety), Sean Mayer(Construction), Frank Petty(Director of
Construction), Mike Ranz(VP Construction), Bob Black(Manager Of Projects),
maybe a few other home office construction managers selected by Mike Ranz or
Frank Petty in attendance. I think you and Rick need to chair the meeting
because you will lend credibility and importance to the issue. You may even
want to invite whoever is John Gillis's boss(or his designee) to sit in to
emphasize the importance of this issue. Too often I hear ""Enron has plenty
of money"" and ""Thats why we have lawyers"" -the truth being we are the
guardians of our stockholders assets and we have a fudiciary responsibility
to protect those assets for the health and well being of the company, the
stockholders and the employees of Enron Corp. My experience has been that we
do a good deal of back stabbing and finger pointing when HR, Safety and
Construction get together and meet on anything. Liability/Settlement checks
regardless of the amount needs to be an issue along with the improvement of
the employment offer process and who is authorized to make decisions
effecting employment offers. In the end if supervisors or managers fail to
act prudently and in the best interest of the company then there is a
penalty. The penalty being they won't get the opportunity to lose more of
the companies money by making reckless decisions. Thats the approach I would
take with these people. The Weigle case does not need to be looked at like
it only cost us $490.00. This continued reckless disregard we have in our
decision making process is going to hit us big one of these days and we will
replace Foster Wheeler's Blue Island Racial Graffitti charge & settlement as
something the EPC Industry talks about. I may be overreacting here but I've
been in the middle of Nepco's harassment, discrimination other issues for
the last 18 months. Call me if you have any questions. Thanks for asking.

Subject: Retention Trust


We have reviewed the trust document and appendices.  Our proposed changes
to the Trust are attached.  We have no changes to the appendices.

As we discussed earlier today, there are two other documents that we will
require to establish the account: 1) Authorized Signers who can direct
Wachovia as Trustee (form attached) and 2) evidence of authority to
establish the trust (I have attached a very generic form that can be
modified).  These forms will not be required to open the trust tomorrow,
but are required documentation

On the issue of tax payments, Pam and I discussed W-2 wages vs. K-1
ordinary income, and you have indicated that these payments will be W-2
income.  As a follow-up item, we would like your counsel to write a letter
to us confirming that this is the proper distribution method for this
trust.  In very short order, we will need detailed payment data so that we
can begin setting up the first payments up for distribution on January 4,
2001.  Should these be W-2 distributions (wages), we will also need to know
the Employer FICA amounts.

Please also confirm the number of affiliates listed in Appendix C (3, I
believe), and Participants/Payments in Appendix B so that I can finalize a
fee quote by morning to include in Appendix D.

Please do not hesitate to call me at home this evening at (336) 712-9598 if
you would like to discuss any of this.

Peter

	2.  Enron is not able to adjust the immigration time frame regarding an ""Out of status"" situation.  We are obligated to

Fran:

As commented yesterday I will like to leave clear the situation on my H-1B and my transfer expenses in case my working relation with Enron finish in the upcoming days. As mentioned I was hired by MG Metals (now Enron Metals and Commodity Corp.) in June 2000, to work in Houston. In October 2000, when I received my working permit I moved into Houston from Mexico City. Enron took care of all the moving expenses.

In the case my relation with Enron finishes, I need Enron to take care of the moving and relocation expenses as well as any tax derived from the entrance of my house hold again into Mexico. As I heard I need to pay taxes if I stayed outside Mexico, a period of less of two years.

Also as commented yesterday I will like to know if Enron will notify the INS, about the termination of the working relation and if its possible to delay this notification, to have more time to prepare the moving and any other issues.

Please comment.

I spoke with Margaret regarding this issue and let her know that I was

I think we could continue to use the current annual report, but I think that
it would be best to amend the INS forms to show whatever the more accurate

Charles and Alice,

Please advise your opinion regarding the INS forms, there are two places
which refer to:
*	Gross Annual Income: $100 billion
*	Net Annual Income: $979 million
Should these be revised to reflect our recent adjustments and if so,
what would you require to attach to the annual report when submitting
these to the INS?  Or should we continue utilizing only the annual
reports and the figures held within?
Thanks!

Karen,

Thanks for taking the time to discuss the confidentiality agreement pertaining to the ENA Trading Track.  As discussed, I am following up with a couple of questions regarding the contents of the agreement, specifically item 1.2.  From what I gather, the agreement very broadly covers the financial industry and I wanted to list a few scenarios to see if they are included or not included by the agreement.
- Non energy, non commodity based private equity firms
- Non energy-sector coverage within a mutual fund company
- Non derivatives based hedge fund
- Non energy based investment banking
- Equity research in with non-energy or commodity industry coverage

Please let me know for each of the above what is included and excluded.

Regards,

Gary Linhart

David,

Late last week, I received a call from Kristen Kracraft, who does employment law at Dynegy.  She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to Enron or vice versa.  Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all.  At a minimum, I would think that you and Andrea Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions.  With that thought, I have asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol.

In the meantime, Kristen mentioned that one person in Rick Shapiro's group wants to go to Dynegy.  She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok.  Do you know about that?  If not, should you give Andrea a call about it?  I am concerned about the floodgate effect, so I believe we should proceed with extreme caution.

Let me know your thoughts on this.  

Michelle

Hi Fran,

 

I know you must be really bogged down with  questions, so my apologies in advance for bugging you, but if you could track  down an answer for me it would be much appreciated.  

 

I am running the Houston Marathon for the Leukemia  Society.  I made a fundraising commitment of $2000.  I have raised  $1000 and have been waiting for the Enron match of $1000 from the matching gifts  program.  The request was submitted well in advance of the cutoff  deadline that was announced via e-mail a few weeks before the layoffs.  The  Leukemia Society has not yet received the match.  If Enron does not come up  with the match, I am personally on the hook for this $1000, and in light of the  small severance situation, it is going to be really tough for me right  now.

 

Do you have any information on whether or not  the Enron commitment will be honored as was communicated in the  e-mail?  Do you have any idea when the funds will be sent to the  Leukemia Society?  Any information you can provide right now will be much  appreciated, so that I can pass it along to the Leukemia  Society.  

 

Thank you,

 

Elizabeth Hutchinson

Correct.  The payments are to employees, who need the funds to pay the IRS with their returns.

Tim, 

Attached is a list of the Dec 3 offcycle checks that are still being held.  The employees need the payments to pay the US tax liabilities due on their 2000 tax returns (final extension Dec 15).

Also on the list are employees expecting TEQ payments with their Dec 15 paycheck, who also need the funds to timely file their US tax returns.

Subject:	ENA v. Miller


Dear  Michelle:
 
    I  just finished my conference call with Liz Miller (counsel for Calpine),  Christina Solomon, and Steve Schuler (Steve is co-counsel for Miller with  Christina).  Christina had passed along to Liz the various points I made at  the meeting last week, so Liz was prepared to address our primary  concerns.  She made the following points:
         
         (1)    She has talked with several different people at various  levels of authority in Calpine's trading area, and insists that Calpine treats  the power grids as ""completely different"" regions, strategies for which are not  shared internally among those regions.    
 
         (2)    She asserts that ""how we do it at Calpine is totally  different from Enron,"" since Calpine is ""trading around a portfolio of assets  that we own.""  She asserted that Enron, not owning power generation assets,  trades differently.  When I replied that Enron does have power generation  assets, she acknowledged the fact but insisted that Enron's trading style is  vastly different due to the difference in emphasis vis a vis the power  generation assets.
 
         (3)    Liz claims that Miller works almost exclusively in  ""Urcot"" (sp??) in Texas, with some participation in Entergy in Louisiana.   According to Liz, Calpine's strategies concerning these specific regions is  divorced from and not related in any way with any trading Calpine does in the  East or West.  
 
         (4)    Liz is of the opinion that Miller ""is not senior enough  that we would be looking for what he knows.""  He has no role whatsoever in  discussing or formulating strategy for trading.  Miller, she insists, is on  the receiving end only.  He takes orders, dispatching and scheduling  solely in response to orders he receives from others.
 
         (5)    Liz acknowledges that, were Miller in a more senior,  responsible position, she would have the same concerns we are expressing were  the tables turned.  Miller is ""so slotted,"" however, that she believes that  he is not in a position to use any Enron trade secret that he might possess  (though she and Miller's attorneys expressed doubt that he could retain any  critical information, that the most critical information changes on a day-to-day  basis).
 
       We  ended the conversation with the following  understandings:
 
        (1)    Liz  will explore whether Calpine could put Miller in a non-trading function for a  period of two months or so.  
 
                 --She hastened to add, however, that trading is the only area for which  they really have any use for Miller.  She then suggested that she could  explore putting him instead in the West (""I know Enron doesn't even have a  western desk here."").  I believe that any proposal she comes back  with will entail his continuing in some trading  function.
 
        (2)    Liz  will try to determine how Calpine might provide assurances (acceptable to  ENA) that Miller is ""on the receiving end only,"" as she asserts, such that we  would be confident that he is indeed not in a position to use any trade  secrets he may remember.
   
                 --On this point, I was clear that I did not know either what level of assurance  ENA would require or whether this would even be a feasible  alternative.
     
         (3)    I am to explore with ENA whether this additional  information about Calpine's difference in trading strategy and the limitations  on Miller's duties alleviates ENA's concerns about protection of its trade  secrets.
 
                 --Liz seems to believe that if the business people really knew the information  she is giving to me, they would not be concerned about the activities of this  low level person.
 
     Liz has asked that we reconnect later this week to exchange answers to  these inquiries.  I look forward to discussing with you our  response.
 
     Thanks for your assistance.
 
Best  regards,
Linda  Broocks

Subject: ECI Payment


Dear Pam,
 
Based on our conversation earlier today I thought it may be easier if I send this email clarifying the points in the agreement relevant to the disputed ECI payment.
 
I understood that the position taken by Luiz Watanabe is that no payment is currently due under clause 4(b)(i) of the Buyout Agreement because the Rio de Janeiro Project is a merchant project and as such it has no PPA.
 
This is an incorrect interpretation because Clause 4(b)(i) states that the the payment is due upon the EARLIER of the PPA signature date OR the Project PAYMENT date. If you then look at the definition of ""SP/RJ Project Payment Date"" on page 7 it tells you that it is the FIRST to occur of ""Financial Closing"" or ""COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION"". And, finally, if you go to the definition of ""Commencement of Construction"" on page 4 it tells you that it occurs when at least 10% of the payments to contractors have been made. This payment in other words is due many months ago as the project is now 100% complete.
 
If you can confirm this by tomorrow please include it in the payment otherwise proceed with whatever payment has been approved and we can do this one over the next couple of days.
 
Finally, regarding to the Employment Agreement payments I will need, as per our agreement, to have access to the accounting data used to determine the IPP Bonus. I think the best way is for me and my accountants to be provided with the name of an Enron accountant who has the data and authority to discuss them with us so that we can address any issues.
 
Thanks and look forward to hearing from you,
 
Diomedes.

Amy,
 
I assume that you will take a stab at the new set of talking points?  I'm out of office tomorrow, but plan to be in on Wednesday as usual, pending child care for my son, which may get me in a bit later in the a.m. than usual.  I think we can get these done rather easily.
 
David, was there any thought of service arrangement/assignment for those employees who are close on green cards?  They could remain Enron employees, but perform services for Netco via an assignment letter.  Perhaps the folks at Tindall & Foster thought that this idea didn't work well, but it may be an alternative for those folks.  Lizzette has been working on immigration issues.  If necessary, we can get her working on that possibility, if Neil doesn't have it in hand.
 
Hope all is well.

Subject: RE: I am concerned about Networks and NETCO


I suggest we talk first. Call me on the following cell phone 713-962-1490. The difficulty I suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the unknown, but in 10 days we will have everything nailed down. Additionally, people, it would appear, seem to be making certain assumptions about the estate which I believe are false. I can't see the estate continuing to sponsor green cards, or in maintaining the cash balance plan, at least in the form of the past, etc., etc., Bankruptcy isn't pleasant.
 
I would however, like to avoid selling NETCO at the estate's expense, as difficult as this may be.
 
The main points we need to communicate and build around would be;
 
Salary - Everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at least at current levels
Job responsibility - This is entirely Jay and Jenny's call. If they see a person as necessary to do a different job, they need to explain that. Typically, people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the current have, that would be the whole point of why NETCO needs them. Clearly NETCO will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite the same prominence it enjoyed with Enron pre-bankruptcy. Unfortunately, that is lost forever.
Bonus - Plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than Enron's current arrangement, if we perform.
Retention - Two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of cash to be paid to the 700 people in NETCO who didn't get anything in Nov. This would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a commitment for them to stay for 3 months or so otherwise they will have to repay it.
Benefits - These will differ depending on who buys us. However, it each case they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different. On the specific point of pension plan, they have plans that require some vesting period but again the 2 main counter parties have agreed that they will take Enron service into account (i.e. if they have 5 years with Enron and their plan requires 5 years service to vest they will vest immediately, but obviously will get just their first years contribution). Now is someone is 4 years in with Enron, I recognise this is not a great answer, but has to be contrasted with how long there is a position in the estate for them (i.e. is there a job for another 12 months). The last point concentrates too much on negative aspects of what may happen to estate, so I would prefer to avoid too much innuendo here.
VISA's - we have a plan to switch all H1b visa's within 24 hours. This is apparently straight forward and Neil and Tim Callahan and I have discussed logistics with one of the counter-parties in some detail. On L1's, these will take up to 3 weeks to switch to H1's. Of the 70 people identified who have VISA's only about 7 or 8 have L1's. Tindall and Foster tell us this will not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the counter-parties who have agreed our approach. These people should avoid traveling outside US in this 3 weeks, but according to Tindall and Foster will be legit.
Green Cards - No easy solution. Essentially these will have to start from scratch. The counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they will support new applications. However, bear in mind I do not believe the Enron estate will continue with green cards, although this has not been officially proclaimed.
Expat Terms - These will probably be honored by the new company, although each counter-party has indicated a desire to ""normalise"" the terms with those of their own company, over time.
Employment Agreements - We have identified 179 across NETCO. The estate plans to transfer these to the buyer, but it is clear that each prospective buyer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal. As such my working assumption is that the offer letters each NETCO ee receives circa Jan 12, will supercede all previous terms including employment agreements, that individuals may have had. Specifically, I expect that the new employer will not honor future equity, cash retention, target bonus or severance provisions that may be in people contracts. Clearly, there may be some negotiation here.
 
Now, we have other things like Title's, PRC, Promotion dates, Salary reviews, project bonuses, All employee stock option programs, etc., to figure out, but I think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises, after all the new employer will be probably one of the 5 biggest investments banks in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over the last 10 years. There may even be an ability to transfer (after a while to a different part of their organisation, if they have an internal posting process).
 
As to process from here, we want to identify those who DON""T want to go and why. I want to avoid ANYONE receiving an ""offer"" to switch and NOT accepting it. As I mention above, many of the terms of the ""offer"" are unlikely to be a huge surprise, and if people have genuine concerns I want to switch them out now for someone who does want to go. We should have 100% acceptance, not because of bullying or ultimatum's but because we figure out early who had concerns, solving them or switching them out for someone else.
 
Jeanie/Amy/Michelle/Neil - looks like we need new updated talking points for all. Lets get them out Weds.

Subject: RE: I am getting heat from IT.....
Importance: High


David,
I talked with Jay on Friday because I was concerned that Steve Stock and Zhiyong Wei, two senior IT guys, had concerns about Netco and were asking me why it wouldn't be better to stay on the Estate. My whole purpose in discussing this with Jay was to make sure he was aware of their feelings. However, it seems that some of  this miscommunication was and has become an exagerration.
 
I attended Beth Perlman's floor meeting when she communciated the difference between the Estate and Netco. She said that Jay Webb would be talking with everyone that had been identified to go to Netco and that she would be talking with individuals that would be staying on with the Estate. She did tell the employees that if they were identified to go to Netco and had a problem with this then they should talk with her and HR. She also said upon deal closure if the Netco employees receive offers and they turn them down it would be a voluntary resignation.  She urged them to please talk with us now if there are any concerns. She also said that we have requested to offer same salaries, to bridge service, and to pay retention bonuses at the time of deal closure. In addition, she communicated that we have limited information but we would update the group when more became available. 
 
It was never communicated that if they went to Netco they would lose their visas, etc. I have received a lot of questions and concerns about visas but my response is that we are working on this and we have it covered. I have also heard a lot of concerns on the Cash Balance Plan and my response is that we have asked to bridge employees service but we will not know until deal closure.  I have stressed that Netco wants to keep intellectual capital and will most likely make a fair offer to keep employees whole. 
 
In talking with employees identified to go to Netco their biggest concerns are 1) they are not guranteed same benefits, salary, bonus, etc and they feel like they will be bullied into accepting the Netco offer and 2)they are on visas and in the green card process and don't want to start the process over because they don't have enough time left on their visa. I have talked to Neil Davies about the second concern and we are trying to come up with some options. I have talked with the concerned employees about what we requested but I am not sure how else to alleviate their concerns. 
 
I will call Jay first thing Monday morning and discuss how we want to correct this miscommunication. Please keep me updated if you hear anything else. Thanks!
 
Mandy

....Essentially I am guessing that what we asked them to communicate re NETCO and what they did may be two rather different things. While the 1078 miles (I counted them - it broke up boredom of drive) between me picking up voicemails here and what is actually transpiring, it sounds like we a mis-communication mess in IT.

People are suggesting that NETCO guys were told, they had no choice but to go and if they didn't they would lose there visa, etc., etc.,

This was not our intention clearly. We (I thought) made it clear that we would initially work on basis that people could choose to stay with estate but we'd like to talk with them about why. If it's VISA's we have that nailed, they shouldn't be concerned. If it's getting ""offered a lower paid job"" that simply isn't in the plans of the NETCO transaction, unless Beth, Jay and Jenny are wanting to do that before the transaction (can't think why they would). Bottom-line, people will transfer to a SOLVENT, Aplus credit rated company, on the same salary on perform whatever job Jay and Jenny ask them to. The benefits will switch, but we already know that counter parties benefits are fairly generous even by our standards, and they will agree to bridge service for vesting in pension et al. Bonus plan should be very good (current proposals are slightly better than Enron's). Titles, promotions, stock awards and base pay raises we aren't sure about just yet, but my working assumption is they will follow Enron previous practice until agreed otherwise.

On retention, we have requested a pool of retention dollars for all those people who didn't receive anything from the estate in Nov and we plan for this to be paid to employees in the form of a cash ""retention/bonus"" payment on or as soon after deal closure as we can. As you guys know these dollars approximate the annual bonus numbers they might otherwise have received if Enron was solvent.

Help me manage this please.

I have made a couple of modifications to the attendance policy based on a couple of suggestions from the HR Community and Legal.  No major changes.  Jenny has a copy of the revised policy.  Upon her approval, we will send to the other Infrastructure Sr. Directors/Directors for review.

Since we are wanting to include our 5 Canadian employees in Montreal I passed some questions to Dawn Doucet in Calgary.  Our Montreal employees receive payroll and benefits via Enron Canada.

She has referred me to the following employment attorney in Canada.  Please see his contact info below.  Assume someone from your group will want to handle the legal inquiries?

Dawn, Tricia,

No doubt you've seen recent announcements form the CEO and COO of EEL regarding headcount reductions.  To that end EEL has rolled out a voluntary redundancy program.  Following suit, Metals NA is also rolling out a Voluntary Separation Program to all staff in the US and we want to include those employees in Montreal.

I've been working with Michelle Cash to finalise the plan, attached are two documents that will give you a summary of the plan.  In essence, its 2 wks base pay per year of service PLUS 2 wks base pay per 10K of salary for an executed Waiver and Release.

Do you see any issues with making the Montreal staff eligible for this plan?

A general employee meeting is being held tomorrow to announce the roll out and Monday will be the 2 wk kick of the program when employees will receive more detail of the plan.

Practically speaking, we anticipate keeping only 2-3 people in Montreal.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks
Cathy

"Project Fireball (personnel question)","Michelle,

The Coal group has a question related to personnel they would acquire from Vulcan if they purchased the marketing rights to their coal.    In this scenario, there are 4 marketing employees which would come to Enron as a part of the deal.   A few things:

In this case, I'm assuming these employees would resign from Vulcan and Enron would extend the appropriate offer.
Secondly, Enron's purchase of the marketing rights will be for an 18mo to 3 year trial period. At the end of the trial period, if Enron returns the marketing rights to Vulcan (or current owner), they want the right to re-call these employees.  George McClellan is ok with the right to recall, but I am not sure how/where to put this in writing ie; in the deal agreement, offer letter, etc.

Thanks,

"Emails on Terrorism Audit and Consultant","Michelle:

After I sent you my prior emails, Garry Mathiason responded with the
following emails on the two subjects that you raised.  Garry usually has
helpful insights so I thought I would pass them along:

Regarding the terrorism audit, this is an ""external"" threat assessment and
requires a qualified security company.  I think that Johnathan Tal could do
such an audit as well as some other more established security firms.

 <<Johnathan Tal>>

Regarding the HR consultant, the potential list is endless.  I have some top
level contacts with Delotte's Human Capital group.  Meanwhile, I think the
best non-attorney group on downsizing is probably  Right and Associates.
This is an area that we (Littler) have developed into a science.  At Cisco,
HP, AA, AOL, Solection, etc. we have advised on many of this issues.  Call
me if you would like specifics.  Garry

Michelle, here is the local contact for Right & Associates whom I have met:

 <<Joe A. Bowden>>

It does not look like we have an off-the-shelf memo on legal issues related
to Terrorism, but with our workplace violence work, we probably can put
something together less expensively and more thoroughly than other firms.
Let me know what we can do to help.

I have combined all of the storyline scripts (Intro and Scenarios 1-7) for
you to send to Legal for their review. Your comments were incorporated in
the scripts for scenarios 1 and 2.  We decided to refer to the company as
both Energy Incorporated and Energy Inc. rather than using E.I. so that
there is no confusion with Enron International. We will not have a coach
exit for scenario 5 until EOD tomorrow after the Ed meeting.  In reference
to your concern over ""locking in a price"" as collusion, those were
Phillip's words but we hope Legal will decide if we need to change them.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

"","Would you mind checking into something for me?  One of our lawyers was called by someone from Industrial Markets who was laid off.  He indicated that he had an employment contract that has a six month non-compete for involuntary termination.  He said that he called HR to get a waiver of the non-compete so that he could pursue new employment and was told that no waiver would be granted.  Is that our policy or are these issues being addressed on a case by case basis?  I find it hard to believe that we would even think about enforcing a non-compete for someone we've laid off, so why not grant the waiver?

"RE: Question","My draft response would be:

The objective is for BU and Functional leads to identify their top and bottom 10% for discussion surrounding the issues you raise, as well as what the leadership believe is necessary in order to meet their business goals and whether these people could be better deployed in other areas or on other challenges. In relation to promotions, we would expect to see a high correlation between those promoted and those highlighted in the top 10%, however, leadership will review nominations for promotion from both the top 10% and the 80%. As a point of clarification, promotions of non-exempt employees takes place at outside this process and is a matter for the individual BU's leadership and supervisors.

Please see the note below which is the result of a brief (4 hour review) by CC. Somewhat predictably, the main conclusion of the review is that, because we haven't followed the model contract relating to data transfers published by the EC, we may not have ""adequately safeguarded"" employees' positions especially since we missed bits out, changed the emphasis from time to time and accorded ourselves rights not otherwise envisaged by the master contract
 
Fundamantal points seem to be

we give no rights to employees to sue under the contract 
we seem to be confused as to whether we are getting consent from employees or relying on the model contract as we seem to be suggesting that we will do both 
we don't make it clear what we are doing with other data (other than employee date) and don't deal with sensitive data 
we impose a burden on Corp to comply with the contract and the laws of the exporter whch is a double whammy 
we don't expressly deal with international transfers 
we have missed a whole host of provisions out from the Model Contract 
we can change the uses for which employee data is used

 
How do you want to take this forward ?

Subject: Data privacy policy and intra-group agreement


Dear Sarah

Further to our correspondence earlier this week, you asked me to look at the documentation that you sent me from a data privacy perspective.  As requested, I set out below what I believe are the significant issues in relation to the relevant documents. 

Preface to policy

*     In relation to the ""Prefatory Statement To Employee Data Protection Policy"" I note that this prefatory statement and the associated policy relate only to employee data and it is therefore unclear what steps Enron is taking in respect of other data.

*     The last paragraph on the first page of the prefatory statement states that ""we are implementing the Employee Data Protection Policy attached to this Preface in an effort to assure employees and the appropriate regulatory agencies that we have in place data protections that are comparable to those mandated by the Directive and other similar data protection laws"".  Enron's obligation is to ensure that it complies with applicable data protection laws.  To the extent that the policy only relates to employee data it will not satisfy regulatory authorities or others that Enron is complying with data protection laws in respect of any other data.

Policy

*     In relation to the policy itself, this does not identify or require employees to comply in a comprehensive way with the various data protection principles under the UK Act or the Directive.  Where principles are reflected, the relevant provisions are on occasion slightly misleading.  For example, the policy says that data is kept ""as long as necessary"".  The relevant data protection principle is that data should ""not be kept for longer than is necessary"" (a difference in emphasis). It seems to me that the policy is seeking largely to fulfil the requirement that individuals (employees in this case) are properly informed of the processing of their data.  This requires Enron to inform individuals of the data controller (or its representative), the purposes of processing and any other information to enable the processing to be fair.  In this regard, section 2 identifies the purposes of processing employee data.  Have checks been made to ensure this is an accurate and reasonably comprehensive description of the purposes for which employee data are processed?

*     Section 2 of the policy states that Enron companies do not access sensitive data ""in making employment decisions described in (i) and (ii)"" of section 2.  To what extent is any sensitive employee data processed by Enron and to what extent have any notices or consents been given or obtained in relation to such data? 


*     In relation to the consent sought in section 3, this does not clearly seek consent to international transfers of data.  The policy also seeks to deem consent stating that by continuing as an employee of an Enron Company"" the employee agrees to the use of his or her data as described in the policy.  It is unclear whether such a deemed consent would be effective.  To what extent is it possible to seek employees' actual consent (e.g. as part of an annual agreement by employees to abide by applicable group codes of conduct, guidelines or policies)?

*     In relation to section 3, this provides that Enron may expand the uses to which employee data is put as described in this policy.  Unless employees are properly informed of or aware of any such changes, it is unlikely that any such changes will be lawful.

*     In relation to section 4, this states that ""we have not established general guidelines for the use, disclosure and retention of personal data. Obviously, the purposes for which we will process personal data, the type of personal data in question and relevant regulatory requirements will guide us in such matters"".  It is unclear what the purpose of this wording is bearing in mind that it would not offer any comfort to regulators that applicable data protection laws are being complied with.  From an employee's perspective, it is not very informative.

*     In the second paragraph in section 4, the policy provides that each individual who is retained by an Enron Company is responsible for ensuring that he or she takes into account the principles established by this policy.  As mentioned above the policy does not clearly address all relevant principles identified in the Directive.  

Master Agreement

*     The master data protection agreement only relates to intra-group transfers of employee data.  What is happening in relation to transfers of other data?

*     To the extent that consents by employees to processing and international transfer of their data have been or can be obtained (e.g. through employees agreeing to a policy that addresses this issue and) then this document would not be necessary as relevant conditions permitting international transfers would have been satisfied.  To what extent can employees' consents be obtained to international transfers?

*     The provisions in this document appear to be based on the European EU model contract.  However, they do not cover all the relevant provisions of the model contract and to the extent that relevant provisions are covered, they tend to be paraphrased in slightly inconsistent ways.  As a result, the question is to what extent can this document be relied on to ensure ""adequate safeguards"".  The EU decision adopting to the model contract states that ""the scope of this Decision is limited to establishing that the clauses in the Annex may be used by a controller established in the Community in order to adduce adequate safeguards within the meaning of article 26 (ii) of Directive 95/46/EC"".  The Decision does not state that similar terms adopted by particular entities will also offer adequate safeguards.  The more that the Master Agreement differs from the EU model contract, the less certainly an entity can have that there are adequate safeguards in place. 

*     Although many provisions in the model contract have been paraphrased in the Master Agreement, I could not find provisions in the Master Agreement corresponding with a number of provisions in the model contract, for example: clauses 2, 3, 4(b),  5(e), 6, 7(1), 9 and 11 of the model contract, and the detailed description of the processing in Appendix 1 of  the model contract.  In relation to Appendix 2, it is unclear where the following are reflected:  Appendix 2, paragraph 3;  the various information requirements in paragraph 6(a) and paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 of Appendix 2.

 *     In relation to the Data Importer - is Enron Corp. the only relevant data importer of employee data from Europe?

*     In relation to the definitions in the master data protection agreement, it is unclear why this does not use the same definition as the model contract.   For example, the definition of ""data processor"" identifies relevant entities that are ""not a member of the corporate group"".  Why are Enron Corporate Group members/excluded from the definition of data processors? 

*     The master data protection agreement does not address the question of sensitive data and no definition of sensitive data is included.  Are any sensitive data transferred? 

*     In relation to section 3(e), this lists again the various purposes of processing employee data.  The description of relevant processing should presumably track the description in the policy to which Enron Group companies are bound.  It is therefore unclear why it is necessary to list again the various purposes of employee processing rather than simply cross-referring to the policy.


*     Paragraph 3(f) states that data exporter will be responsible for obtaining any necessary consents from the data subjects with respect of the processing of personal data.  To the extent that consents are obtained they should also cover international transfers of data.  To the extent that appropriate consents to the international transfer of data is obtained then this agreement is unnecessary.  Again therefore the question is to what extent consents to international transfer of data by employees can be or will be obtained?


*     Clause 3(g) provides that the purposes for which data may be processed can be expanded and that the data importer will endeavour to inform the data exporter of additional purposes of using such data.  This does not conform with the strict ""purpose limitation"" in paragraph 1 of appendix 2 of the model contract.

*     Whereas clause 5(b) of the model contract entitles importers to either abide by the principles identified in the model contract or the laws of the data exporter (which need to be annexed to the contract), the master agreement addresses both these requirements (see in particular paragraph 5(b)).  As a result, to this extent it imposes a potentially higher standard than that required by the model contract.  How does Enron Corp propose to comply with the laws of multiple countries as per clause 5(b)?

*     Clause 9(b) provides that the ""data processor will observe the obligations of a data controller"" - this might mean for example that a data processor needs to register for data protection purposes with applicable data protection regulators.  What legal obligation is this clause seeking to address?

The above comments are based on the UK Act however it is likely that similar obligations will apply in other jurisdictions.

 In light of the above, the key issues are as follows:

*     To what extent is it possible to obtain consents from employees to international transfers?  To the extent this is possible then it is likely that an intra-group agreement will not be necessary;
*     To the extent that such an agreement is necessary, we would normally suggest that this is done substantially on the terms of the model contract.  To the extent that the relevant terms differ from the model contract then there is a risk that the relevant provisions do not offer ""adequate safeguards"" as provided by the Commission decision.  If however, Enron proposes to make transfers under the terms of the master agreement then I would suggest the master agreement should be reviewed in detail so as to ensure that to the fullest extent possible, it accurately reflects all the relevant provisions of the model contract more closely, in particular in relation to rights of relevant data subjects to enforce the contract as a party to it.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like to discuss this further.

Yours sincerely


Lawrence Milner

Attached is the latest draft of a memo outlining the changes to severance, vacation, et al.  While I know that we don't have a decision on severance, Michelle Cash and I have discussed most likely only being able to include a link to the restated plan.  If we do that, any language in the memo related to severance will be very generic.  I've also added information about the suspension of the Educational Assistance Program.  (Q: Rick, is the cut off date Nov. 2002, or should it be 2001?)  Let me know your thoughts when possible.  We'd like to send this as soon as we get word from David that a plan has been selected.

 
Michelle, when we know which plan is selected, we'd still like to have some summary language/talking points we can provide HR generalists and supervisors to help them briefly explain the plan as they are talking with employees.

Just to confirm, the information provided pertains to company #0985, correct?  That is the only EES company that we are preparing bankruptcy analysis for at this time.

Also, is it possible to breakdown the gross payroll on 11/30 by salaried and hourly employees?

H. Break-down of amount of all payroll taxes?
I. Amounts owed in respect of unused vacation?
J. Amounts owed to employees for reimbursement for business expenses etc.?

"Papiers Stadacona Employee Communication","Michelle:
Thanks for taking a look at this memo that Andre Sarasin of Papiers Stadacona would like to send out to his employees today. Please note that this will be issued in French, so this English translation is not perfect...but it least it gets the main message across. Please let me know what you think--both Peter and Cheryl have approved this. 

Thanks,
Jennifer
x3-9964

The management of Papiers Stadacona met yesterday and this morning the union representatives as well as the staff personnel to answer their questions concerning Papiers Stadacona's situation and its owner's.

Mr. Sarasin repeated that the activities of Papers Stadacona are profitable and he has the conviction that it is in the interest of all parties concerned to continue the operations of Papers Stadacona and the Quebec Mill.

In several circumstances during the last quarter of century, the different owners of our company have had financial difficulties and, in every case, the Quebec Mill continued to operate for the simple reason that it is profitable. Mr. Sarasin believes that the present situation is no exception to the rule.

On the other hand, concerning questionings on the pension plan of employees, we are to be reminded that these funds are completely independent from the Company. Indeed, these are placed in trust with the Royal Trust and no creditor can have access to these funds.

The current situation can evolve quickly, but whatever is the result, our strategy is to fill our obligations, i.e. to make papers and board of quality, to control our costs and to continue to improve our productivity and the efficiency of our mill.

Traditional ranking with the correct people addending the meetings.  Pay grid determined by OOC.

Analysts and Associates

Ranked as per Billy Lemmons %'s and then pay grid determined by OOC
I would like to see 25% - 65% - 10%.  Billy disagrees.  This would provide for a quick meeting rather than trying to split them into 4 groups with the top one excluding some awesome people.

Managers/Directors

Ranked from 1 to 100 in as many clusters as the groups see fit.  We are going to combine managers and directors into one table.  The ranking is based on this years performance is directly related to pay.  We will have two meetingss - one for traders and one for other commercial staff (orig/finance/etc).  We will not have a pay prc but will take the results of the rankings and work with individual leaders after the meetings to ensure the appropriate compensation.

We will also determine promotions during this meeting using different criteria.

VP's

We will rank all our VP's from 1 to 100 with a group of selected people - some VP's and some MD's.  
This too will be directly related to pay.

FIRING CONTRACTOR, HIRING NONUNION CREW WAS ULP, SPLIT BOARD
DECIDES

A company that owns and manages a building in New York City
committed unfair labor practices when it abruptly ended its
relationship with a contractor that supplied the building's
cleaning crew and then refused to rehire those workers
because of their union affiliation, the National Labor
Relations Board rules in a 2-1 decision (""E.S. Sutton Realty
Co.,  ""3367 N.L.R.B. No. 33,   9/28/01 [released 10/17/01].
).

Reversing an NLRB administrative law judge, Chairman Hurtgen
and Member Liebman rule that E.S. Sutton Realty Co.
unlawfully refused to hire five workers after it ended its
contract with Crisfield, their former employer. In addition,
Sutton was a successor employer obliged to recognize and
bargain with the workers' union, Local 32B-32J of the
Service Employees International Union, the board rules. The
majority criticizes the NLRB administrative law judge for
resolving in favor of Sutton various inconsistencies in
testimony by Sutton employees. But Member Walsh dissents,
rebuking the majority for second-guessing the ALJ's
credibility assessments. . . . Page AA-1

NINTH CIRCUIT: SUPERINTENDENTS NOT LIABLE FOR UNIONS'
INADEQUATE NOTICE

Public school superintendents in California who deducted
agency fees from the paychecks of nonmember teachers are not
liable for unions' failure to provide an adequate
explanation of the basis for the fee calculation, the Ninth
Circuit rules (""Foster v. Mahdesian, ""9th Cir., No.
00-15028, 10/15/01). Reversing summary judgment granted to
four nonmember teachers, the appeals court holds ""[a]ction
more serious than the routine collection of fees is
required"" to trigger a public employer's duty to ensure that
its employees receive adequate financial disclosure. The
appeals court applies its 1997 decision in ""Knight v. Kenai
Peninsula Borough School District"", which held that a public
employer's duty to ensure proper notice arises when a union
takes action against a nonmember for failure to pay agency
fees.

The four teachers unions, locals of the California Teachers
Association, did not appeal a district court ruling that the
unions' financial disclosure was not adequate under the U.S.
Supreme Court's 1996 decision in ""Chicago Teachers Union
Local 1 v. Hudson"". . . . Page A-1

ANTI-NEPOTISM POLICY BARRING HUSBAND, WIFE UPHELD BY SIXTH
CIRCUIT

A newly wed Tennessee woman, who was forced to leave her job
because of a public utility company's policy barring the
employment of married couples, loses her challenge to the
constitutionality of that policy before the Sixth Circuit
(""Vaughn v. Lawrenceburg Power System, ""6th Cir., No.
99-00012, 10/19/01).  However, the court holds that her
husband, who was also fired following an altercation about
the anti-nepotism policy, can proceed with a claim of
retaliatory discharge under the First Amendment.

 ""The rule of exogamy in Lawrenceburg Power System's
anti-nepotism policy does not violate the fundamental right
of marriage"" and ""advances a legitimate governmental
interest,"" Judge Boggs writes for the appeals court, in
rejecting Jennifer and Keith Vaughn's argument that the
policy violated their First Amendment rights of association.
But he finds that Keith Vaughn's discharge--arguably because
he was speaking out against the policy--could be the basis
of a constitutional claim. . . . Page A-5,  Text E-1

JUDGE REFUSES TO AWARD INSURANCE BENEFITS  TO WIDOW OF
IMPROPER ENROLLEE

The widow of a deceased employee of Oce-USA Inc.  cannot
recover benefits under the group life insurance plan, the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois
rules, finding the employee was not eligible for coverage
when he enrolled (""Ostler v. Oce-USA Inc., ""N.D. Ill.,  No.
00 C 7753, 10/4/01).

Judge Kocoras finds that recovery of life insurance benefits
that would have been paid if Tim Ostler had been eligible
for coverage under the plan would not be ""appropriate
equitable relief"" under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act. The court rejects the Second Circuit's
reasoning in a similar decision in ""Strom v. Goldman Sachs &
Co."" Judge Kocoras says he disagrees with the Second
Circuit's conclusion that Title VII ""remedies can be
imported into an ERISA context, because the rationales
underlying the two statutes are simply too different.""

While Ostler was on short-term disability leave, Oce-USA
offered a new group life insurance plan. Ostler elected to
participate in the plan, and Oce-USA began deducting plan
premiums from his paycheck. After Ostler's death his widow's
benefit claim was denied because Ostler was not a qualified
participant in that he did not fulfill the requirement that
he be an employee ""active at work"" at the time coverage
began. . . . Page A-3

COURT AFFIRMS VERDICT FOR WORKER WITH BAD BACK; DENIES
PUNITIVE DAMAGES

An assembly line worker for a trucking parts firm who was
fired after three work-related back surgeries provided
sufficient evidence of disability discrimination under the
Americans with Disabilities Act and unlawful retaliation for
filing a workers' compensation claim to support a jury
verdict in his favor, the Eighth Circuit decides (""Webner v.
Titan Distrib. Inc."", 8th Cir., No. 00-2941, 10/9/01).
Affirming, for the most part, a judgment for plaintiff
Randall Webner, the appeals court rejects the argument by
Titan Distribution Inc. that Webner does not have a
disability covered by the ADA. ""Viewing all the evidence ...
we conclude that a reasonable jury could have determined
that Webner's back injury had substantially limited his
ability to work, to twist, to bend, and to stand, in
addition to limiting his ability to lift,"" Judge Hansen
writes for the appeals court.

The court, however, vacates a punitive damages award.
Observing that a plaintiff seeking such damages under the
ADA must show that the defendant acted with ""malice or
reckless indifference to the plaintiff's federally protected
rights,"" the court says Webner failed to prove Titan knew it
was violating the ADA or was indifferent to breaching that
law. . . . Page A-4

"RE: Sharon Davis EEOC Charge -- Jenks, Oklahoma","I think reinstatement is a good result if there's an opening for her.  My sense is that Ben, after his investigation, thinks there are gaps, including credibility gaps, in our defense.  Did he tell you that, despite what he had been told initially, he thinks that Davis was replaced with a pretty little giggly thing? Suggest we see if she'll agree to a probationary period of 90 days on the front end--not a PIP, just a probationary period because she'll be a new employee who was not interviewed and hired by the folks at the new site.

Subject: Sharon Davis EEOC Charge -- Jenks, Oklahoma



The EEOC investigator on the Sharon Davis charge called me earlier this week to make a settlement proposal.  Ms. Davis would like to be reinstated to work at another NEPCO job site at the rate of pay at which she was employed while working at Jenks.  She would not, however, like to go to El Dorado, as she believes the people who mistreated her now are working there.

I told the investigator that I wasn't sure whether reinstatement was an option at all, given the reasons for her discharge.  I asked her what the alternative would be.  While she is obtaining that information, I told her that I would raise the reinstatement route with you.

Although Ms. Davis was terminated for undermining the brass-in, brass-out rule by leaving her station, the investigation revealed several mitigating circumstances for her actions.  One, the power was out completely.  She previously had indicated a fear of working on the site at night, but she had no flashlight or any way to reach anybody from the site.  Second, there is the contention that the security guard came by and told her to leave.  Third, this offense is not a terminable one under the NEPCO progressive discipline policy (although of course that policy provides for flexibility based on the circumstances).  Ben's investigation revealed some other reasons why he was concerned about how Ms. Davis had been treated; he can provide detail, if we want.  

The bottom line is that I do not see this as a slam dunk situation, and I believe that some sort of resolution would be fruitful.  What that may look like remains an open question.

Let me know your thoughts. 

Michelle

Good morning, and I hope that this e-mail finds you well.  The reason
for my message is to follow-up with you regarding the conversation
myself, Darlene Donlan, and Greg DeLuca from our organization had with
you a few weeks back.  We had discussed making additions to the Enron
master PWD and getting copies of Enron's Code of Ethics, background
check requirements, and Enron's benefits package regarding the
indemnification clause.  Darlene, who is one of TEKsystems' Controllers,
sent to your attention a copy of the revised PWD with payment terms and
TEKsystems' services, and Mark has been working and communicating with
myself regarding the other requested information.  I just wanted to
follow-up with you to see what additional steps, if any, that TEKsystems
may need to take in order to continue moving forward in the contract
execution process.  If there is any additional information you may
require of us on our end, please let me know and I will be happy to help
assist in any way possible.

I know that you are extremely busy, and that you probably have other,
more pressing matters to spend your time on.  Any feedback you could
provide would be appreciated  and most helpful.  Thank you once again
for your time and consideration, and I look forward to your response.

Respectfully,

"Subsidiary Equity or Phantom Equity","Michelle,

This email confirms our discussion that one of the mandates of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Enron is that they approve all formations of and grants related to any subsidiary equity or phantom equity plans.

Mary and I can and will work closely and quickly with any group needing to get this done.  Mary is responsible for presenting the plan for approval to the Compensation Committee after Tax, Legal, Accounting, Commercial and HR interests are scrubbed.

These types of plans have accounting, legal and tax complexities that need to be worked out and change regularly.  Also, it is very important that no written or verbal promise related to equity grants before Compensation Committee approval is obtained.

Here's some basic data on this ee:

Date of Hire: 		12/18/2000
Supervisor:		James Scribner
Bus. Unit:		ENW - Energy Operations
Mid Yr. 01 Rating:	5
Comments:		Scribner became supervisor when Tammie's previous supervisor left Enron (approx. mid yr.).  Short tenure with Enron may be part of the reason why 			her relative ranking was a 5. (HR rep is researching and will confirm)

HR Rep has met with supervisor and assured me perf. review will be done this week.  The HR rep also spoke with Tammie.  We are addressing Tammie's question in the last sentence below.  As a result of her MY01 rating, she would normally get a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) in addition to her performance review.  Due to the review being so overdue, my recommendation would be to drop the PIP and only do the review as it is unreasonable to expect Tammie could accomplish the milestones in her PIP by the time her group does their PRC meeting (M. Cash to provide legal opinion on this issue).   I have advised the HR Rep and supervisor to further explain to Tammie the relative ranking process and the role it plays in Enron's culture and ongoing performance management process.  

I'll forward additional information as I receive it.

"RE:","This is basically how it was handled last year, except they are splitting Orig and Trading.  Regarding Assistants - we need to provide them the bonus targets rather than OOC just deciding.  Regarding noncommercial - again, we need to provide the targets (as we discussed earlier this week).

The biggest issue we have is how to use GCS and avoid the manual excel spreadsheet-GCS-excel spreadsheet exercise we went through last year.  We are working with Jeanie Slone and GCS team on this.  

VP's have to go through the final Corp-wide PRC, so that is one more step for the VP's and the ENA meeting outcome should be consistent with how all are rated going into the final meeting (ie., 10/80/10, 1-100).

Here is our plan on PRC.

Assistants:

Ranked 1,2,3 by supervisors - pay determined by Me and Louise.  No meetings.

Non Commercial but in North America:

Traditional ranking with the correct people addending the meetings.  Pay grid determined by OOC.

Analysts and Associates

Ranked as per Billy Lemmons %'s and then pay grid determined by OOC
I would like to see 25% - 65% - 10%.  Billy disagrees.  This would provide for a quick meeting rather than trying to split them into 4 groups with the top one excluding some awesome people.

Managers/Directors

Ranked from 1 to 100 in as many clusters as the groups see fit.  We are going to combine managers and directors into one table.  The ranking is based on this years performance is directly related to pay.  We will have two meetingss - one for traders and one for other commercial staff (orig/finance/etc).  We will not have a pay prc but will take the results of the rankings and work with individual leaders after the meetings to ensure the appropriate compensation.

We will also determine promotions during this meeting using different criteria.

VP's

We will rank all our VP's from 1 to 100 with a group of selected people - some VP's and some MD's.  
This too will be directly related to pay.

Cheers as you Brits say

Thank you for helping us work towards sign-off from Enron Legal. Seeing as
you haven't been closely involved, I thought you'd like an update on our
media production tasks.

As you know, we are completing our planning phase for the production of the

enjoyable to work with.  Below is an email from Steve, the director for our
storyline video, explaining where we are in the production process.

Hey Sheri,
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving! I can't believe it's over
already! Anyway...we've shuffled the schedule around, securing the 6th and
7th of
December for the shoot in the studio. We're working on finalizing the
edit dates to reflect that shift. Chris is moving to hold all talent for
those dates.

I guess it's now in the hands of legal! As soon as we confirm the edit
suite
availability
we'll revise and post the new schedule. We're scheduled for our weekly call
tomorrow but if
anything comes up just give me a buzz!
Thanks Sheri!

Hello Steve and Chris -

Recently, there were changes to the overall number of our scenarios in our
simulation. There will be seven scenarios versus the nine we have been
discussing. These changes result in:
        Deletion of 2 intro and 2 exit videos
        Deletion of six interview questions (see more detail below)
        No additional characters. We will still need all characters (and
        talent) that we have casted for.

Laura has been working with John to make the required edits to the scripts.
We have recieved today (mid-day).

Based on our last discussion, I'd like to recommend we set the date for our
shoot for the end of the first week in Dec. Specifically, Dec. 6th and 7th.
This recommendation is based on the response I received from our project
manager in regards to the time it will take to have Legal review our
scripts.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you and have a
wonderful Thanksgiving!

Our Coal group is planning to close an office we have in WV at the end of this year.  There are 4 employees in this location; one has been offered a job in Houston and has declined, another employee may be offered a job with a JV we have nearby.

I wanted to see if there are any notification requirements in WV and if so, what they are.

Thanks,

The attached spreadsheet should represent a complete set of developers of EnronOnline since inception.  I haven't named the individual Valtech and Agency.com developers since the agreements we have with those companies presumably cover all of their developers.
 
The rest of the systems will probably not be done until tomorrow.

"FW: Broadband litigation work","Michelle, I have talked to Steven Sheldon, Martin Sacchi, and soon to talk to Marc Hensel and Ed Smida as well as Michele Nezi Marvin re: broadband litigation support work.  Luckily for the effort, I think all of these people, with the exception of Steven have a longer term position at broadband or elsewhere at Enron.  If this group of people or some subset thereof remains at Enron then I think we can get good litigation services from them re: broadband claims.  Call me if you have any questions.  Sherron.

Options
I don't see a path to ask questions about the merger, so I'm submitting here.  Will the merger ratio be applied to our option strike prices as well?  (e.g., for Enron options with a strike price of around $84, will the new strike price of these options be multiplied by .2685 for a new strike price of $22.55 in the new company's stock?)

Cost Savings
I moved to 3 Allen Center about a year and a half ago and was assigned a new phone number.  However, I occasionally receive forwarded calls from my old number (853-4792, I think).  It appears two direct dial numbers are being maintained for me, and likely for all employees who ever had an EB number and moved to 3AC.  We could save some money by getting rid of the old numbers.

"Dr. Mo's notice period","Michelle,

All efforts to try to get Mo to reduce his contract pay and end the separation negotiations have been unsuccessful and on August 9th, he sent me an e-mail stating that he has decided to continue his garden leave with full pay & benefits and will await ""Enron's notification regarding termination according to his employment terms.""

We were prepared that he would come back with this and we will continue to pay him, but it's this last statement about the notification of termination that concerns me.

I would have thought that our presentation of a separation agreement to him back in November would have been enough written ""notification"" that we do not wish to continue his employment past the contract end date, but in speaking with him further, he seems to think that its not.  

His contract states that if the Company terminates your employment without 12 months written notice, then the Company shall pay you the remainder of your salary for the 12 months from the date it gave your notice, in a lump sum.  

His contract end date is 6/30/2002 and the last thing we want to do is to pay him additional money.  Please let me know what your legal interpretation of this notification clause is and whether or not we are required to give him a formal termination notice.

Thanks

"RE: I am concerned about Networks and NETCO","Here is a first stab at a q&a type doc based on the start Amy and Jeanie made last week
 
 
Neil

-----Original Message----- 
From: Oxley, David 
Sent: Sun 12/30/2001 5:02 PM 
To: Curless, Amanda; Davies, Neil; Cashion, Tana; Slone, Jeanie; Cash, Michelle; Fitzpatrick, Amy 
Cc: 
Subject: RE: I am concerned about Networks and NETCO


I suggest we talk first. Call me on the following cell phone 713-962-1490. The difficulty I suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the unknown, but in 10 days we will have everything nailed down. Additionally, people, it would appear, seem to be making certain assumptions about the estate which I believe are false. I can't see the estate continuing to sponsor green cards, or in maintaining the cash balance plan, at least in the form of the past, etc., etc., Bankruptcy isn't pleasant.
 
I would however, like to avoid selling NETCO at the estate's expense, as difficult as this may be.
 
The main points we need to communicate and build around would be;
 
Salary - Everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at least at current levels
Job responsibility - This is entirely Jay and Jenny's call. If they see a person as necessary to do a different job, they need to explain that. Typically, people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the current have, that would be the whole point of why NETCO needs them. Clearly NETCO will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite the same prominence it enjoyed with Enron pre-bankruptcy. Unfortunately, that is lost forever.
Bonus - Plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than Enron's current arrangement, if we perform.
Retention - Two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of cash to be paid to the 700 people in NETCO who didn't get anything in Nov. This would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a commitment for them to stay for 3 months or so otherwise they will have to repay it.
Benefits - These will differ depending on who buys us. However, it each case they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different. On the specific point of pension plan, they have plans that require some vesting period but again the 2 main counter parties have agreed that they will take Enron service into account (i.e. if they have 5 years with Enron and their plan requires 5 years service to vest they will vest immediately, but obviously will get just their first years contribution). Now is someone is 4 years in with Enron, I recognise this is not a great answer, but has to be contrasted with how long there is a position in the estate for them (i.e. is there a job for another 12 months). The last point concentrates too much on negative aspects of what may happen to estate, so I would prefer to avoid too much innuendo here.
VISA's - we have a plan to switch all H1b visa's within 24 hours. This is apparently straight forward and Neil and Tim Callahan and I have discussed logistics with one of the counter-parties in some detail. On L1's, these will take up to 3 weeks to switch to H1's. Of the 70 people identified who have VISA's only about 7 or 8 have L1's. Tindall and Foster tell us this will not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the counter-parties who have agreed our approach. These people should avoid traveling outside US in this 3 weeks, but according to Tindall and Foster will be legit.
Green Cards - No easy solution. Essentially these will have to start from scratch. The counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they will support new applications. However, bear in mind I do not believe the Enron estate will continue with green cards, although this has not been officially proclaimed.
Expat Terms - These will probably be honored by the new company, although each counter-party has indicated a desire to ""normalise"" the terms with those of their own company, over time.
Employment Agreements - We have identified 179 across NETCO. The estate plans to transfer these to the buyer, but it is clear that each prospective buyer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal. As such my working assumption is that the offer letters each NETCO ee receives circa Jan 12, will supercede all previous terms including employment agreements, that individuals may have had. Specifically, I expect that the new employer will not honor future equity, cash retention, target bonus or severance provisions that may be in people contracts. Clearly, there may be some negotiation here.
 
Now, we have other things like Title's, PRC, Promotion dates, Salary reviews, project bonuses, All employee stock option programs, etc., to figure out, but I think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises, after all the new employer will be probably one of the 5 biggest investments banks in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over the last 10 years. There may even be an ability to transfer (after a while to a different part of their organisation, if they have an internal posting process).
 
As to process from here, we want to identify those who DON""T want to go and why. I want to avoid ANYONE receiving an ""offer"" to switch and NOT accepting it. As I mention above, many of the terms of the ""offer"" are unlikely to be a huge surprise, and if people have genuine concerns I want to switch them out now for someone who does want to go. We should have 100% acceptance, not because of bullying or ultimatum's but because we figure out early who had concerns, solving them or switching them out for someone else.
 
Jeanie/Amy/Michelle/Neil - looks like we need new updated talking points for all. Lets get them out Weds.

Importance: High


David,
I talked with Jay on Friday because I was concerned that Steve Stock and Zhiyong Wei, two senior IT guys, had concerns about Netco and were asking me why it wouldn't be better to stay on the Estate. My whole purpose in discussing this with Jay was to make sure he was aware of their feelings. However, it seems that some of  this miscommunication was and has become an exagerration.
 
I attended Beth Perlman's floor meeting when she communciated the difference between the Estate and Netco. She said that Jay Webb would be talking with everyone that had been identified to go to Netco and that she would be talking with individuals that would be staying on with the Estate. She did tell the employees that if they were identified to go to Netco and had a problem with this then they should talk with her and HR. She also said upon deal closure if the Netco employees receive offers and they turn them down it would be a voluntary resignation.  She urged them to please talk with us now if there are any concerns. She also said that we have requested to offer same salaries, to bridge service, and to pay retention bonuses at the time of deal closure. In addition, she communicated that we have limited information but we would update the group when more became available. 
 
It was never communicated that if they went to Netco they would lose their visas, etc. I have received a lot of questions and concerns about visas but my response is that we are working on this and we have it covered. I have also heard a lot of concerns on the Cash Balance Plan and my response is that we have asked to bridge employees service but we will not know until deal closure.  I have stressed that Netco wants to keep intellectual capital and will most likely make a fair offer to keep employees whole. 
 
In talking with employees identified to go to Netco their biggest concerns are 1) they are not guranteed same benefits, salary, bonus, etc and they feel like they will be bullied into accepting the Netco offer and 2)they are on visas and in the green card process and don't want to start the process over because they don't have enough time left on their visa. I have talked to Neil Davies about the second concern and we are trying to come up with some options. I have talked with the concerned employees about what we requested but I am not sure how else to alleviate their concerns. 
 
I will call Jay first thing Monday morning and discuss how we want to correct this miscommunication. Please keep me updated if you hear anything else. Thanks!
 
Mandy

....Essentially I am guessing that what we asked them to communicate re NETCO and what they did may be two rather different things. While the 1078 miles (I counted them - it broke up boredom of drive) between me picking up voicemails here and what is actually transpiring, it sounds like we a mis-communication mess in IT.

People are suggesting that NETCO guys were told, they had no choice but to go and if they didn't they would lose there visa, etc., etc.,

This was not our intention clearly. We (I thought) made it clear that we would initially work on basis that people could choose to stay with estate but we'd like to talk with them about why. If it's VISA's we have that nailed, they shouldn't be concerned. If it's getting ""offered a lower paid job"" that simply isn't in the plans of the NETCO transaction, unless Beth, Jay and Jenny are wanting to do that before the transaction (can't think why they would). Bottom-line, people will transfer to a SOLVENT, Aplus credit rated company, on the same salary on perform whatever job Jay and Jenny ask them to. The benefits will switch, but we already know that counter parties benefits are fairly generous even by our standards, and they will agree to bridge service for vesting in pension et al. Bonus plan should be very good (current proposals are slightly better than Enron's). Titles, promotions, stock awards and base pay raises we aren't sure about just yet, but my working assumption is they will follow Enron previous practice until agreed otherwise.

On retention, we have requested a pool of retention dollars for all those people who didn't receive anything from the estate in Nov and we plan for this to be paid to employees in the form of a cash ""retention/bonus"" payment on or as soon after deal closure as we can. As you guys know these dollars approximate the annual bonus numbers they might otherwise have received if Enron was solvent.

Help me manage this please.

Tim,

(1) We rescinded approximately 8 offers in November. It was decided that individuals who gave up jobs to accept our offer would be paid out one month of salary (with a signed release). I had two people who fell into this category and signed releases but have not received the one month salary. Will they be paid out?

(2) I have received several calls from terminated employees concerning the termination letters. They are concerned that they have 30 days in which to transfer to their spouse's plan and won't meet the deadline. My understanding is that the terminations letter will be mailed out soon.

"RE: I am concerned about Networks and NETCO","I suggest we talk first. Call me on the following cell phone 713-962-1490. The difficulty I suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the unknown, but in 10 days we will have everything nailed down. Additionally, people, it would appear, seem to be making certain assumptions about the estate which I believe are false. I can't see the estate continuing to sponsor green cards, or in maintaining the cash balance plan, at least in the form of the past, etc., etc., Bankruptcy isn't pleasant.
 
I would however, like to avoid selling NETCO at the estate's expense, as difficult as this may be.
 
The main points we need to communicate and build around would be;
 
Salary - Everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at least at current levels
Job responsibility - This is entirely Jay and Jenny's call. If they see a person as necessary to do a different job, they need to explain that. Typically, people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the current have, that would be the whole point of why NETCO needs them. Clearly NETCO will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite the same prominence it enjoyed with Enron pre-bankruptcy. Unfortunately, that is lost forever.
Bonus - Plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than Enron's current arrangement, if we perform.
Retention - Two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of cash to be paid to the 700 people in NETCO who didn't get anything in Nov. This would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a commitment for them to stay for 3 months or so otherwise they will have to repay it.
Benefits - These will differ depending on who buys us. However, it each case they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different. On the specific point of pension plan, they have plans that require some vesting period but again the 2 main counter parties have agreed that they will take Enron service into account (i.e. if they have 5 years with Enron and their plan requires 5 years service to vest they will vest immediately, but obviously will get just their first years contribution). Now is someone is 4 years in with Enron, I recognise this is not a great answer, but has to be contrasted with how long there is a position in the estate for them (i.e. is there a job for another 12 months). The last point concentrates too much on negative aspects of what may happen to estate, so I would prefer to avoid too much innuendo here.
VISA's - we have a plan to switch all H1b visa's within 24 hours. This is apparently straight forward and Neil and Tim Callahan and I have discussed logistics with one of the counter-parties in some detail. On L1's, these will take up to 3 weeks to switch to H1's. Of the 70 people identified who have VISA's only about 7 or 8 have L1's. Tindall and Foster tell us this will not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the counter-parties who have agreed our approach. These people should avoid traveling outside US in this 3 weeks, but according to Tindall and Foster will be legit.
Green Cards - No easy solution. Essentially these will have to start from scratch. The counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they will support new applications. However, bear in mind I do not believe the Enron estate will continue with green cards, although this has not been officially proclaimed.
Expat Terms - These will probably be honored by the new company, although each counter-party has indicated a desire to ""normalise"" the terms with those of their own company, over time.
Employment Agreements - We have identified 179 across NETCO. The estate plans to transfer these to the buyer, but it is clear that each prospective buyer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal. As such my working assumption is that the offer letters each NETCO ee receives circa Jan 12, will supercede all previous terms including employment agreements, that individuals may have had.

Clearly, there may be some negotiation here.
 
Now, we have other things like Title's, PRC, Promotion dates, Salary reviews, project bonuses, All employee stock option programs, etc., to figure out, but I think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises, after all the new employer will be probably one of the 5 biggest investments banks in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over the last 10 years.

I'm can quickly develop some talking points, but can we get concensus on what the messages should be prior to the 3:30 pm meeting?

Here's something for discussion purposes only:
Per the Enron analyst call, we've established which businesses are core to Enron and will move with the merger, as well as those businesses that are no longer core.
To that end, we will quickly begin to restructure the company by downsizing non-core businesses and non-essential functions in an effort to immediately reduce operating expenses.
The timing is unknown, but is expected in the next two to three weeks.
WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE REVISED SEVERANCE PACKAGE
No one could have anticipated the convergence of events that have brought us to this point.  While many are saddened by the merger, we must acknowledge that this was by far the best alternative for Enron and its employees.
All employees, including managment, are experiencing some degree of grief and disbelief.  Please continue to maintain your professionalism and treat your coworkers with respect during this difficult time.

This is a rough outline.  I'd enhance whatever we provide HODs.  Keep in mind too, that any new messaging is going to invite a whole new series of questions.  Some initial questions might be 1.) will the revised severance be set until the merger (could it be reduced again for a later round of layoffs), and 2.) will service be bridged if you are layed off by Enron but hired on by Dynegy after the merger.

we have an HR generalists update meeting at 3.30 today. The intent is to provide them an update on the past few days, explain why the questions answering process takes a while, boost their morale a little, and provide them a selection tool/spreadsheet.
I think some updated talking points would be a good idea to add to this.

  I'd like to see if you've been able to do anything about my vestment in the cash balance plan.
Currently there is over $18,000 in there and based on Monday's date, I am only 6 days away from
vesting.  As I said before, I have turned down jobs earlier this year so that I can atleast meet this
5 year mark.
 
  Please call me at 281-485-3911 or reply as soon as possible.

Dynegy has scheduled an all day due diligence session this Thursday beginning at 9 a.m. which obviously conflicts with the Bill Rome Mediation.  First thought: can we re-schedule? Second thought: the Dynegy meeting will be here at Enron - I can be in and out of the meeting but need to be here in the building.  In addition, how long will this take?  I would rather not re-schedule the mediation if at all possible but can't re-schedule the Dynegy meeting either.

Hello, George.  I hope all is well with you.
 
Below is a question from Mark Greenberg, an attorney here in EWS, about Arthur Andersen and whether we have some sort of Enron-wide agreement with them.  I would think that it would be in our best interests to have some sort of global agreement, particularly one with volume discounts in the event that all of Enron uses a certain level of service.
 
Is something like that in the works?  If not, do you believe that it would be useful?  If so, I would be happy to assist in drafting such an agreement.
 
I'm around all this week (except Wednesday when I'll be at a mediation) if you would like to discuss.
 
Thanks.

Michelle - 

I left a message with Twanda for you to give me a call.  Lately I have been asked to review letter agreements between EWS and Arthur Anderson LLP for services to be provided by AA.  These services generally relate to having AA personnel work on EWS projects on Enron property (in our offices).  I have asked GSS if we have any global agreement that would cover this, but have been advised that the only AA agreement we have is an old one that has probably been rolled in to the Accenture LLP group - which is an offshoot AA and, as I understand it, not affiliated with AA any longer.

The concern with the letter agreements is that they favor AA in most all salient terms, contain non-solicit provisions and are sometimes not provided to Enron before the work has been initiated or, at times, completed.

It would seem to me that either a Corp. or EWS master agreement should be put in place to handle these. 

Let me know your thoughts and how you want to proceed. 

Thanks.

Hi, Andrea,
 
I think this captures most everything on Jordan's slide -- it looks good.  
 
One thought -- I kind of believe that the bullet on governmental relationships may not really be ""compliance,"" as it is more of what Kean's group would do.  If we are going to have a heading called ""compliance,"" then I believe that we should add bullets on updating, publicizing, and striving for AAP targets, audits of compensation at all levels (which is where the OFCCP audit came from), audits of other employment practices (e.g., staffing, PRC, promotions, layoffs, etc.), risk management processes in termination of employment, and other related items.  This should be a combination of compliance, government relations, and legal.  Perhaps we call is HR Risk Mitigation/management instead???  (I don't really have the answers/context, so it may not be appropriate).
 
Thanks for the opportunity to comment.
 
Michelle

"Revised Section 3.4B","Michelle, here is a suggested revision to Section 3.4 B which I believe will accomplish the objective we discussed.  We need to draft procedures to be adopted by the Committee. 
B.  If a terminated employee who is entitled to receive a severance benefit under the Plan receives a notification of layoff from Enron in compliance with the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, is placed on a period of paid leave of absence or furlough before termination of employment by Enron, and continues on the payroll of Enron for such period, the severance benefit payable under the Plan shall be reduced and offset, in a manner prescribed in procedures established by the Committee, by the amount of pay received by such employee during such period.

Pam,

Attached is a file that calculates the average salary over the last 5 years based information provided by payroll.  If all five years were not available, then the average is based on the number of years available (i.e. 3 years of information received from payroll, then average is total salary divided by 3).  See the worksheet labeled average calc to find the calculation of the 2.99.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  The highlighted employees are those that US payroll did not have any information.  I noted in the comment column that they were Canadian employees or UK.  I checked with Tim Callahan and Richard Lewis is not an expat.

Dear Michelle and Anthony,

This is a draft response to Jim's letter of November 16, 2001 (which has been faxed to you both today) that I would like to send him tomorrow (after we get any comments from you two). Caroline has reviewed it already.

Also Anthony, I am a little concerned about Jim's statement that he is still working for Enron Japan albeit at home.  I wonder if you should call him to chat about this and see what he means (and possibly take advantage of that opportunity to let him know from the horse's mouth (so to speak) that (i) unless EJ can identify investors for its various businesses, it will probably need to be closed in the not too distant future anyway and (ii) in any case he cant get water out of a stone - i.e. he can sue EJ till the cows come home but it has no money to pay him and given that the Enron name will disappear from the face of the earth, Enron Corp. probably doesn't really care about preserving its reputation in Japan any more so is as likely as not to lust let Jim wind up Enron Japan if he is willing to spend the money.)  It could of course well be that he is just trying to show us that as far as he is concerned he is still employed and rejects the ""unlawful"" termination in which case i am not so concerned.

I suggest we wait and see what his lawyer puts in the writ before deciding what to do next.

Thanks.

David, a couple of things:

1. Cheque. Will need to write you a UK cheque, have assumed an FX rate of
1.45 and and the Dollar amount is 77,919.66 , so that makes 53,737.70
Sterling. Who do I need to make the cheque out to? Can you also wait until I
give you the nod next week to cash it? The money should be in the account by
monday, but would like to make certain.

2. Could we draw up something brief in writing to cover our agreement from a
few evenings ago?

Everything hectic at present, we managed to get a removals company at short
notice, a flight back to blighty this weekend, and somewhere to stay in
London. Looking forward to working with the Enron Europe guys again.

Thanks for your help in all of this,

When the plan document is finalized, we will prepare unanimous consent resolutions for adoption by the board of directors of the two participating employers.  It has always been the Enron practice to have an employer's board of directors approve such a plan for purposes of corporate governance.

I received a suspicious phone call from Kathy Delano at Portland General who was asking for the names of the employees who were still reporting to me.  Kathy said that she works for Arlene Barnett (VP HR), who wants to send all of us a 25 page document.   

Without providing them any information, I took down their names and checked the Enron phone book.  I verified that the names are Portland General HR representatives; however, I am not sure why Portland General HR would be wanting to send something to us.    

The number Kathy provided was (503) 464 - 8000 - which appears to be the main Portland General switch board.

Maybe I am being a bit too paranoid - however - can you follow up on this.

"Revised Restated Plan Docucments; 1 of 2","Attached is one of the plan documents that has been revised in the following manner: 
The beginning of Section 3.2 was revised to include a ""subject to"" provision. 
Section 3.4 was separated into two parts.  Part A is the original provision.  Part B is a new provision. 
Using this revised design, every laid off employee, whether subject to WARN, would receive the same net amount of severance benefit, whether a WARN penalty had to be paid by the employer, whether a WARN notice was given in advance of layoff, or whether WARN did not apply to the lay off in any way.  
I've received a thumbs up from Michelle for the revisions, which are marked in the attached document to facilitate your review. 
Pat 
The second plan document will be sent as an attachment to a separate email.

Fran, we need to discuss this. I will not pay on my own the moving expenses and the taxes derived from such situation . The contract will be terminated on Enron's option. When you (Enron) bruoght me and my family into Houston, the inmigration specialists should knew this situation.

The moving expenses does not only include the plane tickets. I need to move my household.

		Regarding your requests below:

	1..  Enron will pay for the cost of plane tickets to fly you and your family back to Mexico, if your position is eliminated.

	2.  Enron is not able to adjust the immigration time frame regarding an ""Out of status"" situation.  We are obligated to 
	notify the INS 60 days your termination date.
	
	3.  You are responsible for any taxes due to your home country.

Fran:

As commented yesterday I will like to leave clear the situation on my H-1B and my transfer expenses in case my working relation with Enron finish in the upcoming days. As mentioned I was hired by MG Metals (now Enron Metals and Commodity Corp.) in June 2000, to work in Houston. In October 2000, when I received my working permit I moved into Houston from Mexico City. Enron took care of all the moving expenses.

In the case my relation with Enron finishes, I need Enron to take care of the moving and relocation expenses as well as any tax derived from the entrance of my house hold again into Mexico. As I heard I need to pay taxes if I stayed outside Mexico, a period of less of two years.

Also as commented yesterday I will like to know if Enron will notify the INS, about the termination of the working relation and if its possible to delay this notification, to have more time to prepare the moving and any other issues.

Please comment.

My recollection is the costs to us were roughly:

2 weeks for $10k in pay
Min 8 weeks max 52

Scenario 2				$45m
1.5 weeks
1.5 weeks
Min 8 max 39

Scenario 3				$35m
Dynegy
2 weeks
Min 13 weeks max 52

I've pitched the following compromise to Dynegy this morning:

2 weeks for service
2 weeks for every $10k of salary capped at $100k
Min 13 weeks max 52 weeks.

Can you run numbers and correct above if I'm way off.

You came and spoke to my new hire class last Monday. I have a pending book deal with Zondervan publishing and wanted to make sure that there was no problem re the confidentiality agreement. 
 
I am certain there will be no problem. I have been a minister for 22 years and have a proposal being pitched by the senior editor at Zondervan to their editorial review board. The book will draw on my leadership/team-building experiences in the church and will be written from the perspective of a minister / mba. It will have nothing to do with Enron.
 
Please let me know when would be a good time to come by.

		Chaps,

		We need to get below asap as part of updating our due diligence. Need it by Monday if possible. In reality while we mention the 4 companies below, I need to total benefits and payroll costs run through US payroll on the Corp account. Similarly with other questions (ie if payroll are entirely separate then leave out otherwise please include).

		We need the following information for the following Enron companies:  Enron Corp., Enron North America Corp., EPMI (Enron Power Marketing Inc.), and Enron Liquids 
		Fuel Inc.:

		Kathy -- General breakdown of where persons are employed (geographic) 
		Terrie (Diane Taylor) -- Annual payroll amounts (gross of taxes, and with taxes included)
		Terrie (Diane Taylor)  -- Amounts of accrued, but unpaid wages, salaries, unemployment taxes, withholdings (federal, state and local income taxes, social security taxes, and Medicare taxes) as of  11/27, 11/28, 11/29, and 11/30 (presumably this is mainly a fraction of 11/30 payroll plus some estimate of overtime worked in this period but not yet paid?)
		Robert Jones -- Amounts due to critical contract (ie non-employees) personnel, if applicable (I recognize that this information may be more difficult to obtain, so perhaps best to put this one at the end of the data search)
		Chris Rahaim -- Aggregate amount of unpaid, accrued benefit obligations (excluding vacation, severance, and workers comp), which includes retiree benefits and other benefits), broken down as follows:
		Chris Rahaim  -- premium payments for employee benefits insured by third parties for the benefit of the company's employees (including retirees), including payments for group life, group accident, long-term disability, medical, dental, vision, EAP, retiree medical, and any others.  Please identify and outline the cost for each plan, as well as a brief description of coverage, and include those that have not been listed specifically here.  Describe which of these are self-funded, if they are not insured by third-parties.
		Chris Rahaim  -- payments due with respect to any defined contribution savings plan.
		Chris Rahaim  -- description of who participates in 401k plans and the matching program.  Where are the matching portions held?  Where does the company keep the funds that have been withheld from paychecks but have not yet been disbursed to the trustee for the savings plan?  What is the amount of accrued, but not disbursed contributions?  
		Terrie (Diane Taylor)  -- employee deductions for flexible spending plans, charitable donations, and wage garnishments?  What is the aggregate amount as of 11/30?

		Ken Mathis -- Description of workers compensation coverage.  What policies are in effect?  What is the deductible amount?  Is there a deductible per claim with a stop loss, an aggregate deductible, or what?  What are the amounts, and how much has been incurred year to date?
		Ken Mathis -- In which states do the above companies have workers compensation coverage?  What is the frequency with which the company obtains new workers comp policies?  When are they up for renewal?
		Ken Mathis -- How are workers comp premiums paid?  Have any letters of credit been issued or posted for these obligations?
		Kathy -- Do the companies have any employees in Ohio?  
		Ken Mathis If so, when is the next payment due to the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation?  What would be the amount due?

		George Wasaff (John Gillespie) -- Do we have any ability to determine amounts owed employees under expense reimbursement policy as of 11/26 through 11/30?  

		Chris Rahaim  -- What are the costs of administration paid to consultants and professionals to maintain compensation obligations, benefits, obligations, and reimbursement obligations, broken down as follows.  How much has been paid so far, and how much is owed?
			-- claims administrator for medical, vision, dental, and health plans
		Ken Mathis -- workers comp insurance administrator
			-- nonqualified benefit plans administrator
		Chris Rahaim  -- payroll tax processor (Pro Business) and COBRA administrator
			-- group accident/life insurance provider and administrator
			-- group accident life insurance provider, LTD provider, and administrator for both policies
			-- employee assistance program administrator
			-- post-65 healthcare provider and administrator
			-- retiree medical provider and administrator
			-- administrator for savings plans
		Ken Mathis -- administrative costs associated with current workers comp provider and administrator for certain policies
			-- cost of on-site doctors office and related administration

		Aaron Brown -- Costs to administer and maintain employee stock option programs and plans
		Chris Rahaim -- Costs to administer and maintain other benefit and compensation programs or plans not mentioned above.  Please describe the programs, the benefits, eligibility requirements, and amounts involved.

		Terrie (Diane Taylor) -- Identify payroll accounts for the company

		If there are other types of expenses for compensation or benefits that have not been described above, please provide that information as well, including the type of benefit, the cost, the provider, and the persons eligible.  For example, I have not included Chris Rahaim  -  Enron Kids Center above, but believe that it should be included as an employee benefit.  If there are others I have omitted, please include in this list.

		Thanks a lot.  Call me at home (713-218-7155) or on my cell (713-302-5522) if you have any questions.

"Unemployment Question","Hi Michelle,

The presentation went as well as it could.  There was quite a bit of stunned silence, but the questions are already starting to trickle in.

One particular question on unemployment insurance I'm not familiar with, hoping you or Drew can help.

Since the VSP is effectively a voluntary election, would employees qualify for unemployment insurance, specifically in New York State.

Under the involuntary program, is the severance payment offset by unemployment compensation?

You can see where this question is leading, some people may be hedging their bets on the time value of the money.

Thanks

Michelle, 
It sounds like this employee has a severance agreement, as referenced in Laura Kinningham's message to you and Lizzettee dated 10/9/2001.  Was severance paid outside of the Severance Pay Plan pursuant to a special severance agreement?  Such agreements are not needed when severance is paid under the Severance Pay Plan.

No it doesn't sound crazy, it is exactly what I was hoping you would provide.  Please send the company numbers with the list.  Also, just to make sure, you want employees only, not contractors or joint venture employees, right?

I talked to Marsha and Mr. Bowen is going to give us a list of bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies. Then could you send us four lists - bankrupt domestic employees, non-bankrupt domestic employees, bankrupt international employees, non-bankrupt international employees? Does that sound crazy? :-)

I'll forward the list when I get it.

Cindi,

I need some clarification on the lists that you need.  We currently have lists for ALL SAP US which should provide the domestic people, and by combining the ALL GLOBAL list with the ALL SAP UK list you should have the international people.  How do we distinguish between the bankrupt and non-bankrupt entities?  Do you have a list of companies that define this?

Regards,
Johnna

Can you talk to the people that manage global messaging and make sure that they have the ability to segregate broadcast messages into domestic and international and bankrupt and non-bankrupt entities.  It is important that we clean this up.

If we are talking about LakeWorth, Florida, I understand that HR was

to send Ogletree a site map so that it could evaluate the issue of the
dual
gate.  I understand that Ogletree has lined up local counsel for that
site.

If there are others that need to be addressed (which appears to be the
case), I suggest that we have a discussion next week to develop a
strategy.

   Given you don't have the history I wanted to mention the duel gate
   policy

   was developed in cooperation with Charlie Caulkins of Fisher&Phillips
   prior

   to 1988. I first experienced the use of this policy/procedure on a
   project

   that had both picketing at the gate and an injunction granted in 88.
I
   don't

   think much in the policy has changed since that time.  This policy
was

   reconfirmed by Ogletree in the last couple of years. I just wanted to
   check

   one more time on the issue of whether we can install after the fact.

   Let me know when and who we can chat with. Thanks.

   Mike Ranz,

   On the local legal representation and pre-drafted injunctive relief

   strategy, this message is being forwarded to Michelle Cash for her

   consideration of local counsel to hire and whether this gets
organized
   by

   Ogletree or internally by Enron (i.e.: Michelle).  We can discuss by

   conference call with you, me, Mike Indivero and Michelle Cash.

   On the dual gate system (whether its used or not but still put into
the

   project per Dodson's recommendation), let's get more informed on this
as
   you

   suggest.  Again, by copy to Michelle, we need to get better informed

                   David and or Mike,

                   I apologize if I know the answer to this and have
   forgotten

   but I am reminded once again by my review of labor of the issue of
local

   legal representation.  Which projects today have we identified local

   representation with a pre-written injunction for activity at our site
   gates.

   I know we talk about Dell so I assume we have that one but Southaven,

   Eldorado, Gila are certainly ones we should have also. Please let me
   know

   which ones we have in place and ready to action if a need arises. I
   would

   also like to have a copy of the one for Dell and any others we have.

                   On a second matter, Dodson is convinced we need to
   establish

   a second gate and have it active no matter what. Our current policy
is
   we

   plan but don't always install and have active. His opinion is in some
   places

   if we don't have it and trouble comes, we would not be allowed to
   install

   one. Obviously this is not my experience and knowledge of the legal
   system.

   Could we set up a brief phone conversation in the next few days with
   Stubley

   to chat about our second gate policy.

"Re:","
As discussed:

What happens to my wages/salary if the Company files for bankruptcy
protection?

The general rule is that a company that has filed a banruptcy petition is
not able to make payments on any prepetition debts until a plan of
reorganization is filed.

However, there are certain exceptions to the general rule.

Claims related to wages and salary earned within 180 days of a bankruptcy
petition filing (called ""prepetition wages and salaries"") receive a special
priority for upt to $4650 under the bankruptcy code (section 507(a)(3)) and
are usually paid in full as part of the plan of reorganization.  Most
companies that intend to continue operating while in bankruptcy recognize
the need to keep employees working and the potential hardship that would
occur of wages were not paid or delayed.  As a result, most companies that
file a bankruptcy petition, but which inetend to remain in business, seek
the specific authority of the bankruptcy court to make payments on the
priority wage claims immediately so that employees will experience little
or no disruption in their wage/salary payments while they continue working.
Usually this authority is sought at the same time or shortly after a
bankruptcy petition is filed.  For a company that derives a great deal of
its value from its employees, making sure these payments are made in a
timely manner is a high priority.

"Should we say something about the PRC?","Should we get Greg and ENE OTC to send an email out today saying something like:

In light of all of the recent extraordinary business matters that have been facing us we have held of launching the traditional year end PRC process.
Many of you will recall in our response to the lay it on the line survey we had announced several changes to this process primarily deigned to clarify the purpose of the PRC meetings and streamline the process.
However, given all that has happened in the last 3 weeks and all the critical business matters including the strategic review of our core and non-core businesses, we have concluded that it would be wise not to dictate we follow the previously announced guidelines.
Specifically, we will delegate to each of the business unit leads to decide whether they want to use the 360 PEP electronic feedback process and what form they would like to undertake any relative talent discussions.
Please look for further details and direction on the above from your BU lead in the next few days.
While we hope you understand that we need to make sure that we channel our efforts appropriately at this difficult time, we would want to make sure that everyone understands that:
	1. We will have a bonus process. This will be conducted largely as in the past, but with a particular emphasis on those employees		 		critical to business operations and ensuring our ability to successfully complete our proposed merger with Dynegy.
	2. If there is a rationalisation of headcount following our strategic business review of core and non-core, this will be conducted			 appropriately. Our PRC process will not be the sole determinant in any such process, many other factors will be considered and as such			 this will be a separate process. 


Need help with last 2 bullets! Question is whether to send now or wait for another 3 weeks.

"","Just got off conference call with Wachovia to review trust arrangement particularly to ensure that this is effective in not triggering tax until time of payment rather than triggering tax at funding of trust.  We think this arrangement does that as long as the following is true:
Funds put in trust should not be paid out until 2002 to provide for ""service period/vesting"" requirement
Must be irrevocable i.e. funds can never come back to employer so need to be careful not to overfund

Also, to keep from being subject to ERISA, need to assume that payments are not delayed until termination.  (IF subject to ERISA, creates ugly reporting/compliance issues and discrimination testing.....)

 The issue of whether to set up a new employer i.d. to hold the trust is a question - might provide more security and protection in the event of bankruptcy but might create tax deductibility issues.  Might be better if we could set up subparts for different employers to ensure tax deductibility.  I will run by external tax counsel with utmost discretion.  

If this is to be used for non-U.S. employees, need to ensure arrangement doesn't trigger taxable event at funding due to local tax law.  May not be an issue.

Are we contemplating including any insiders?

"Kristin Walsh- Questions for You","Michelle,

Kristin Walsh, a manager in Competitive Analysis, is returning from maternity leave on October 15th.  During Kristin's absence, the following changes have occurred in the group, and I just wanted to run them by you before we communicate them to her:
1)  Kristin will only have two direct reports instead of three.
2) Previously, Kristin's team as a whole was responsible for providing ENA (i.e. John and Louise, as well as traders) with competitive intelligence.  Instead of Kristen just overseeing the ENA process as a whole, Kristin and her two team members will have more specific duties, although Kristin will still be the primary point of contact for ENA.  Specifically, Kristin will gather and provide intelligence info for the Gas Team, and Kelly Holman will gather and provide info for East Power, and  Greg Whitman will do the same for West Power.  Robert Johnston, Kristin's supervisor,  and Scott Tholan, BUL, just felt like the level of service that Kristin's team was providing was not adequate because efforts were duplicated and Kristin could not provide enough ""face time"" with the head traders to gather and relay info, as well as directing her team.  

Also,after Kristin's departure, it was learned that Kristen signed a contract for which she had no authority. Although Scott does not think that this has happened before, this particular contract blew up in their face.

Upon Kristin's return, Scottt, Robert, and I would like to communicate these changes to her (not in writing, just verbally), and just reitterate the fact that only Scott has the authority to sign contracts.  Additionally, we would like to tell Kristin that she needs to take a management training class so that she can learn to delegate and oversee responsibilities of the group, rather than micromanaging them.  Please let me know if this is going to create any additional problems, or if I need to take a different approach.  

As always, thanks for your help.

Workplace - Includes all Enron premises and any location where company business is being conducted or in which employees perform essential job functions, including all property, land, onshore and offshore platforms, office buildings, structures, installations, training facilities, plants, pipelines, boats, aircraft, and vehicles which are Enron-owned, leased, used, or operated, or which are located on Company property; as well as fenced areas to which general public access is denied or limited by Enron.  Also covered are any personal effects or items, including desks, lockers, workstations, personal belongings, and privately owned vehicles located on or in Company property.

Leave in the phrase, ""...attending an Enron-sponsored function off Company premises..."" in referencing locations where an employee should not be impaired by alcohol or drugs, as reasonable efforts are made to provide safe transportation and/or other options for impaired employees at Enron-sponsored social functions.
Add references to the state and federal Drug Free Workplace Act and non-DOT policies.
Stance on driving safety proposal is to state that the use of communication devices while driving poses a significant risk and that employees should comply with applicable law and business unit practices.
Michelle - in your notes, you commented, ""What about drug testing?""  How much and which information would you like to see on this topic?

Have I missed anything?
 
Thanks so much for your time and assistance,

Michelle, I don't know if I have the final restated plan document.  I'm not sure what changes anyone made after my last draft.  I don't even know what the design decision  was regarding the formula.  I think that Kriste has it or Mary Joyce should have it. 
The best way to incorporate the revised paragraph into the plan would be to cut and paste the revised paragraph over the existing paragraph B.

For the following question from Michelle's list:


8.  Para 18:   Please update $15 million figure to reflect tuition
reimbursement expenses


Can you please run the following reports:

YTD payments for Wagetype 1350 (Tuition Non Taxable) and 1351 (Tuition Taxable).    For an estimate for December, I would suggest running the same wagetypes for the month of May.  (I am assuming that May and December are comparable for reimbursement requests).

Subject: Collection Wording in Assignment Letters



Michelle, 

Please review the following wording highligted in red.  Our goal is to be able to automatically deduct any outstanding balances (tax advances, expense advances/loans) from assignees when they terminate.  The collections are usually offset against the vacation payout & severance.  

If EMPLOYEE's assignment by COMPANY, as described in this Assignment Letter, is terminated by COMPANY or by EMPLOYEE, upon such termination, regardless of the reason therefore, all compensation and all benefits to EMPLOYEE under this Assignment Letter shall terminate; and any outstanding balances due COMPANY will be deducted from any remaining payments due EMPLOYEE.  If EMPLOYEE's employment hereunder is terminated by COMPANY, then EMPLOYEE may be eligible for severance payments as set forth and governed by the Enron Corp. Severance Pay Plan (Restated January 1, 1993).  ...

Tim, 

I added the wording to Section VIII of the letter, Item F, Terminations.  Attached is the full text for reference. 

Thanks,

We can probably keep it non-tax specific, i.e., to include items like expense report advances or other loans. 

Should your employment with the Company cease, any outstanding balances due the Company will be deducted from any remaining payments due you.

I propose that we submit the following paragraph into the assignment letters which states that we can deduct any funds owed to Enron for tax settlements from future severance payments:  

""Please note that should your employment with the Company cease and it is determined that you owe a refund to Enron after your tax return is calculated, the Company has the authority to deduct these funds from any future severance payments.""

Please feel free to make any necessary changes.

I've went through the current list and provided the dates of those who have accepted the certificate of compliance.  The people in blue have not complied.  While I was at it, I looked to ensure all these people are still active employees.  The four in red have withdrawn and their termination date is listed for you.  
 
David, the one bolded in red received a retention payment but was terminated due to reduction in force on 12/14/01...???

Hi, Andrea,
 
I think this captures most everything on Jordan's slide -- it looks good.  
 
One thought -- I kind of believe that the bullet on governmental relationships may not really be ""compliance,"" as it is more of what Kean's group would do.  If we are going to have a heading called ""compliance,"" then I believe that we should add bullets on updating, publicizing, and striving for AAP targets, audits of compensation at all levels (which is where the OFCCP audit came from), audits of other employment practices (e.g., staffing, PRC, promotions, layoffs, etc.), risk management processes in termination of employment, and other related items.  This should be a combination of compliance, government relations, and legal.  Perhaps we call is HR Risk Mitigation/management instead???  (I don't really have the answers/context, so it may not be appropriate).
 
Thanks for the opportunity to comment.
 
Michelle

Subject:	2001 Affirmative Action Plan

This year the Office of Labor & Employee Relations (OLER) is pleased to provide your business unit's 2001 Affirmative Action Program online.  The online site contains the documentation required to meet our regulatory obligations including the AAP narrative, goals and utilization analysis.  We have also included links to critical EEO/AA policies and related information.   We are excited about this opportunity to simplify your access to this critical and important information.   Please reference this web-site when you have an open position that needs to be filled or when considering transferring and promoting employees.   The URL link is listed at the bottom of this message.

Through our Affirmative Action Programs we take positive steps to ensure that we deliver on our commitment to EEO.  Affirmative Action is not about quotas for women or minorities nor is it about preferential treatment to less qualified candidates because of their race, gender, disability or veteran status.  Through affirmative action, we seek to establish a ""level playing field"" for all employees and applicants, regardless of race, gender, disability or veteran status.  We use statistical analyses of employment patterns as indicators of whether the playing field is truly level.

The AAP contains proprietary information, therefore it should not be shared with anyone outside of Enron.  If your operating company is participating in a bidding process where EEO/AAP information is requested, please forward those requests to the corporate Office of Labor & Employee Relations at EB1561 or call (713) 853-3086.  Please refer to Enron's Code of Ethics book for guidance concerning your obligations of confidence with proprietary company information.

Although the AAP contains proprietary information and belongs to Enron Corp., the narrative section is to be made available for review during regular work hours to all job applicants and employees who ask to see it.  We ask that these requests be forwarded through Human Resources and that the web site you are accessing not be shared.

We would also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm the strong commitment of Enron Corp. to the principle of Equal Employment Opportunity in its personnel policies and practices.  It is our Company policy to recruit, hire, train, and promote into all job levels, the most qualified employees and applicants for employment, without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability, or veteran status.  All employee selections are based on (1) inclusive recruitment and outreach efforts, and the merit, qualifications and competence of individuals for the particular positions, and (2) consistently providing equal employment opportunity.  We believe that a diverse workforce is a strength, and that as we implement personnel policies and practices which foster fair treatment on the basis of race, sex and disability, we promote equitable employment opportunities for all employees and applicants.

Enron administers all personnel programs and employment opportunities without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, pregnancy, national origin, physical or mental disability, veteran status, or status as an alien authorized to work in the United States.  Such employment programs and opportunities include, but are not limited to, compensation, benefits, transfers, layoff, leaves of absence, return from layoff, training, education, tuition assistance, and Company-sponsored social and recreational programs.

We have developed and implemented the 2001 Affirmative Action Program (AAP) to support our commitment to the principle of equal employment opportunity and meet federal and state requirements.  The AAP describes, in detail, the policies and procedures used in the Company's operations to carry out its commitment.

Your company's EEO Officer, as stipulated in your plan narrative, is responsible for administering the Company's Affirmative Action Program and will report to senior management on a continuing basis with regard to the progress being made under the AAP.  If you have questions, comments or concerns about Enron's Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action policies, please speak with your supervisor or your Human Resource Representative.

As with any rollout of a new web-site, errors, while not expected, may occur.  Please contact AA Program@enron.com if you are unable to log-in or experience any difficulties.  We would recommend that once you access the site you add it to your ""favorites"" list for future reference.

Rick or Cole,

PR received the following question.  We'd like to have an answer prepared, but don't plan to post it or include it in any of the Q&A that will accompany scripts.  (You may want to include it in an HR Q&A or post to LiveLink.)

Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will that affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?

Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver as part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareholder class action suite against Enron.

You had asked us to review the employment agreement under Mississippi.  Here is the analysis we have.  As I mentioned, we do not have any lawyers actually resident in Mississippi, so we did the work here.  This analysis seems comprehensive enough.  Let me know if you need anything else.

To:     Notestine, Kerry 
Subject:        ENA agreement- review for compliance with Mississippi law 
Generally, the agreement is compliant with Mississippi law.  It is not hard to comply with Mississippi law when it comes to employment agreements.  Mississippi is pretty much the opposite of California in regard to employee rights.  Mississippi does not have many restrictions.  Plaintiffs' employment attorneys would probably starve in Mississippi if it weren't for federal laws.
Mississippi allows non-competes and protection of trade secrets and confidential business information.  It has a pretty broad view of what is included in that category, so I think the agreement is ok in that regard.  Specifically, the case law says that a covenant not to compete may be enforced if ""necessary for the protection of [the employer's] business and goodwill.""  See Texas Rd. Boring Co. of La.-Miss. v. Parker, 194 So.2d 885 (Miss. 1967).  The validity and enforceability of a non-compete is predicated upon the reasonableness and specificity of its terms, primarily, the duration of the restriction and its geographic scope.  See Redd Pest Control Co. v. Heatherly, 248 Miss. 34, 157 So.2d 133 (1963).  To be enforceable, the covenant must strike a balance between the interests of the employer and the employee, and its enforcement must not pose a threat to the public of monopoly or unfair competition.  See Empiregas, Inc. of Kosciusko v. Bain, 599 So.2d 971, 975 (Miss. 1992).  
Incidentally, even if the court found the terms and categories of a non-compete to be too broadly defined, that would not be a problem because Mississippi courts can blue pencil those types of things to make non-competes enforceable.  The time and geographic restriction in this agreement would most likely be found to be reasonable under Mississippi law, as other courts have upheld similar restrictions.  The only concern I have in that regard is that the agreement says it will be enforceable even against an employee who is termed without cause, and Mississippi law holds that Court's should not enforce non-competes if the employee was terminated in an arbitrary or capricious manner or in bad faith.  However, I don't think that means we need to change the language in the contract, I just think you need to advise the client of that fact so it cannot expect to be able to terminate an employee in bad faith and still enforce the non-compete.   
Mississippi allows for employment agreements to be arbitrated.  Thus, the arbitration provision is fine.  The only thing I might add is a clause which says, ""The arbitrator selected may not have any interest in the subject matter in dispute, nor can he be related by consanguinity or affinity to the parties entering into this agreement"" because that is a requirement under Mississippi law.
Incidentally, my only other concern is that the agreement says it will be governed by Texas law.  Choice of law is an unsettled area in Mississippi when it comes to employment agreements/non-competes in Mississippi, so there is no reason why the client cannot insist on such a provision.  However, the client should probably be advised that such an area of law is always subject to change and it might be enforced by a Mississippi court regardless of what the agreement says.

Who do I need to talk to about changes to our Infinity Customer Solutions contract?

We have added a supervisor at a different rate per month and I think the contract should reflect that.

Mike/Alan,

Jim Weisser below was an EBS employee who was terminated in the last couple of weeks.  He was hired as EJ and seconded to EBS.  This is what has been done with EBS, Metals and EPower.  We have discussed his termination with Baker & McKensie, our local attorney, and they believe there is little merit.

We will keep you abreast.

TITLE VII PUNITIVE DAMAGES NOT DEPENDENT ON COMPENSATORY
DAMAGES

Punitive damages may be awarded in cases under Title VII of
the 1964 Civil Rights Act regardless of whether a judge or
jury awarded any compensatory damages, the Second Circuit
rules, addressing an issue of first impression
(""Cush-Crawford v. Adchem Corp., ""2d Cir., No. 00-7617,
11/16/01). The appeals court affirms a jury verdict of
$100,000 in punitive damages but no other damages for Tonia
Cush-Crawford in her Title VII sexual harassment suit
against Adchem Corp. The statute allows a maximum of
$100,000 in total damages for companies of Adchem's size.

The statutory caps ""strongly undermine the concerns that
underlie the reluctance to award punitive damages without
proof of actual harm,"" Judge Leval writes. Citing the
different purposes underlying the award of compensatory
damages and punitive damages, Leval also says it would be
improper for an employer who acted with malice or reckless
indifference to the employee's rights to escape the award of
punitive damages just because the employee was fortunate
enough to avoid suffering actual harm . . . . Page AA-1,

JUDGE REJECTS CHALLENGE TO FORD'S POLICIES FOR EXTENDING
FMLA LEAVE

Ford Motor Co.'s requirement that absent workers notify the
employer of the need to extend an approved medical leave
within five days of the expiration of the leave does not
violate the Family and Medical Leave Act, the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Michigan rules (""Alexander
v. Ford Motor Co.,  ""E.D. Mich.,  No. 01-70051,  11/5/01 ).

 A group of Ford employees sued challenging the company's
""five-day quit"" procedures, as applied to those employees
seeking to extend an approved FMLA leave. Department of
Labor regulations interpreting the FMLA require the employer
to give employees two days to notify it of the need for an
extended leave, so Ford's more generous policy does not
violate the act, Judge Edmunds finds, granting Ford summary
judgment on the claim. . . . Page A-7

FEDERAL EMPLOYEES CAN BRING RETALIATION SUITS UNDER ADEA

Federal employees may bring retaliation claims against their
agencies under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the
District of Columbia Circuit rules (""Forman v. Small, ""D.C.
Cir., No. 00-5256, 11/16/01). Although the ADEA provision
waiving sovereign immunity for federal employee suits does
not specifically mention retaliation claims, the language
requiring that federal agency personnel decisions ""shall be
made free from any discrimination based on age"" is broad
enough to do so, the court explains in a retaliation suit
brought by a curator for the Smithsonian Institution.

Unlike the express prohibitions applicable to private,
state, and local employers in ADEA Section 623(d), the
provision governing federal agencies, 29 U.S.C. Section
633a(a), does not by its terms prohibit retaliation.
""Congress's failure to mention 'retaliation' explicitly does
not undermine its intended breadth of the provision,"" the
court says. It is difficult to imagine, it adds, how a
workplace could be ""free from any discrimination based on
age"" if a federal agency could fire or take other action
adverse to an employee for complaining about age
discrimination. . . . Page A-1

WORKER'S CLAIM ADVANCES BASED ON REQUIRED REPORT TO
HARASSING BOSS

A machine shop worker at a Pennsylvania factory can proceed
with her sexual harassment claim against her former employer
because the company's internal policy required her to report
the actions to her supervisor--who was one of the alleged
harassers, a federal judge in Philadelphia rules (""Hare v.
H&R Industries Inc., ""E.D.Pa., No. 00-CV-4533, 11/7/01).

Rejecting H&R Industries' motion for summary judgment, Judge
James McGirr Kelly of the U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania holds that former employee
Priscilla Hare presented enough evidence for her claims
under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the
Pennsylvania Human Relations Act to go to trial.

Hare's evidence showed that the company's policy was
ineffective and that her failure to pursue it was
reasonable, the court holds, and she also presented evidence
that her subsequent termination resulted from harassment. .

NO DENIAL OF BENEFITS TO DEPRESSED HARASSER, DIVIDED COURT
DECIDES

A Michigan probation officer allegedly unable to continue
working because of depression arising from his suspension
for sexually harassing female public defenders, may not be
denied workers' compensation based on his status as a sex
harasser, a divided Michigan Court of Appeals rules (""Daniel
v. Corrections Dep't, ""Mich. Ct. App., No. 224423, 11/2/01).

Tony Daniel's conduct was not willful and intentional and
the depression he faced is too attenuated to find that it
occurred by reason of his acts, Judge Danhof holds in
reversing the judgment of the workers' compensation board
and trial court. Calling Daniel an ""unsympathetic"" and
""difficult"" employee is not enough to disqualify him from
receiving benefits, the appeals court says. The state
workers' compensation law was designed to remove the focus
on the consideration of the fault of the claimant, the court
says.

In dissent, Judge O'Connell says that allowing a serial
sexual harasser to profit from his misconduct was
""untenable"" and a result never contemplated under the state
workers' compensation law.  . . . Page A-5

Rodney,

I see in the NY Times that Enron paid out some $50,000,000 in retention
bonus' prior to decalring bankruptcy.  I would like to bring to your
attention the fact that I am due a retention bonus and requested that this
be paid last week.  This was prior to the announcement of Enron filed for
bankruptcy.

I would appreicate hearing where this stands.

We are struggling with the appropriate company identifier for business cards.  We are employees of Enron America, however some of our business cards show Enron North America (carryover from days of old), EWS (no longer/or will no longer exist), and some show Enron Corp (International Admin group).

Marge Nadasky in Corp Public Relations who deals with the Company logo and Company names on business cards, etc., has indicated that Legal prefers we use the operating company we are part of rather than Enron Corp (piercing the corporate umbrella issue).  She did say we could use just plain Enron if we are not part of the corporate group.  

As part of a network services function which crosses all Enron business units, do you see any problems if we use Enron on business cards?  We have several who have changed positions or never had cards and need new ones.

HIGH COURT CONSIDERS FEDERAL RULE TOLLING STATE LAW
LIMITATION PERIODS

The U.S. Supreme Court hears oral arguments in a case
examining the constitutionality of a Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure that tolls the statute of limitations in a state
law claim while a related action is brought in federal court
(""Raygor v. Regents of the Univ. of Minn.,  ""U.S.,  No.
00-1514,  ""oral argument"", 11/26/01 ).

Lance Raygor and James Goodchild, former employees of the
University of Minnesota, ask the justices to overturn the
Minnesota Supreme Court's January 2001 ruling finding
unconstitutional a state appeals court's decision that the
lower court's application of 28 U.S.C. Section  1367(d),
part of the federal supplemental jurisdiction statute, was
barred by sovereign immunity under the 11th Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution because it impermissibly prolonged the
state's exposure to liability.  The university, however,
urges the justices to affirm, arguing that Section 1367(d)
is unconstitutional. . . . Page AA-1

SUPREME COURT DECLINES TO REVIEW APPEALS COURT RULING ON
SUBCONTRACTING

The U.S. Supreme Court declines to review an appeals court
decision that a ready-mix concrete company violated the
National Labor Relations Act by selling its trucks and
hiring independent contractors to perform delivery work
without first bargaining to impasse over the issue
(""Naperville Ready Mix Inc. v. NLRB, ""U.S., No. 01-280,
""cert. denied"" 11/26/01). The owner of Naperville Ready Mix
Inc. and two related companies announced during contract
negotiations with International Brotherhood of Teamsters
Local 673 that he wanted to sell the delivery trucks to
owner-operators. The owner supplied the financing, did not
require any down payment, required buyers to give first
priority to Naperville's hauling needs, restricted
purchasers from working for competitors, sold subsidized
fuel, provided truck repair services, and allowed free truck
storage on site.

The Seventh Circuit in March 2001 upheld the National Labor
Relations Board's ruling that the plan to shift delivery
work from employee drivers to subcontractors was a mandatory
subject of bargaining. The change to using subcontract
haulers was motivated by a desire to save on labor costs and
was not a core entrepreneurial decision beyond the scope of
the companies' obligation to bargain with the union, the
appeals court decided. . . . Page AA-4,  Text E-1

ELEVENTH CIRCUIT SAYS EX-EMPLOYEES MAY SUE UNDER ADA

Former employees may sue under the Americans with
Disabilities Act to challenge limits on post-employment
benefits, a divided Eleventh Circuit rules, reversing its
position in an earlier case that ex-employees are not
covered. In an issue of first impression in the Eleventh
Circuit, Judge Pollak remands to a federal district court in
Florida a case brought by a former Kmart employee forced to
resign because of emotional illness (""Johnson v. Kmart
Corp., ""11th Cir., No. 99-14563, 11/21/01). In reversing the
circuit's position in ""Gonzales v. Garner Food Servs. Inc."",
Judge Pollak cites an intervening Supreme Court decision
that ex-employees may sue under Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act, the law from which the ADA's definition of
employee is drawn.

The court says a narrow reading of ADA Section 12112(a) to
exclude coverage of former employees ""would not only bar a
whole class of plaintiffs from access to remedies regarding
the administration of post-employment benefits,"" but also
would nullify sections of ADA Title I that protect against
discriminatory discharge and authorize courts to order
reinstatement. Judge Carnes dissents, arguing that because
the Supreme Court did not expressly overrule "" Gonzales"",
the case is still good law. . . . Page A-1,  Text E-10

RESEARCH BUREAU SAYS RECESSION BEGAN IN MARCH

The National Bureau of Economic Research says the U.S.
economy fell into recession in March, ending a 10-year
expansion that was longer than all others in the nation's
history. Widely anticipated by private forecasters, NBER's
pronouncements are regarded as the official word on business
cycle turning points.

The NBER's finding that the recession began in March means
the downturn is already nearly nine months old. Recent jumps
in unemployment, as well as other indicators of the weak
economy, were cited by the bureau as evidence that the
downturn merits being termed a recession. . . . Page A-6,

JUSTICES DECLINE TO REVIEW COURT'S DISMISSAL OF NAFTA
CHALLENGE

The U.S. Supreme Court lets stand an appeals court ruling
that courts have no jurisdiction to determine whether the
president and Congress had the constitutional authority to
enact the North American Free Trade Agreement (""United
Steelworkers of Am. v. United States, ""U.S., No. 01-5,
""cert. denied"" 11/26/01). The United Steelworkers and the
Made in the USA Foundation sought review of a March decision
by the Eleventh Circuit finding that the suit raised a
political question over which the court had no jurisdiction.

The leaders of the United States, Canada, and Mexico signed
the NAFTA agreement in December 1992, and Congress approved
and implemented the agreement one year later on a majority
vote. The plaintiffs alleged that NAFTA's approval
circumvented the Constitution's Treaty Clause which requires
two-thirds approval by the Senate. . . . Page AA-2,  Text

"ENA v. Miller","
Dear  Michelle:
 
    I  just finished my conference call with Liz Miller (counsel for Calpine),  Christina Solomon, and Steve Schuler (Steve is co-counsel for Miller with  Christina).  Christina had passed along to Liz the various points I made at  the meeting last week, so Liz was prepared to address our primary  concerns.  She made the following points:
         
         (1)    She has talked with several different people at various  levels of authority in Calpine's trading area, and insists that Calpine treats  the power grids as ""completely different"" regions, strategies for which are not  shared internally among those regions.    
 
         (2)    She asserts that ""how we do it at Calpine is totally  different from Enron,"" since Calpine is ""trading around a portfolio of assets  that we own.""  She asserted that Enron, not owning power generation assets,  trades differently.  When I replied that Enron does have power generation  assets, she acknowledged the fact but insisted that Enron's trading style is  vastly different due to the difference in emphasis vis a vis the power  generation assets.
 
         (3)    Liz claims that Miller works almost exclusively in  ""Urcot"" (sp??) in Texas, with some participation in Entergy in Louisiana.   According to Liz, Calpine's strategies concerning these specific regions is  divorced from and not related in any way with any trading Calpine does in the  East or West.  
 
         (4)    Liz is of the opinion that Miller ""is not senior enough  that we would be looking for what he knows.""  He has no role whatsoever in  discussing or formulating strategy for trading.  Miller, she insists, is on  the receiving end only.  He takes orders, dispatching and scheduling  solely in response to orders he receives from others.
 
         (5)    Liz acknowledges that, were Miller in a more senior,  responsible position, she would have the same concerns we are expressing were  the tables turned.  Miller is ""so slotted,"" however, that she believes that  he is not in a position to use any Enron trade secret that he might possess  (though she and Miller's attorneys expressed doubt that he could retain any  critical information, that the most critical information changes on a day-to-day  basis).
 
       We  ended the conversation with the following  understandings:
 
        (1)    Liz  will explore whether Calpine could put Miller in a non-trading function for a  period of two months or so.  
 
                 --She hastened to add, however, that trading is the only area for which  they really have any use for Miller.  She then suggested that she could  explore putting him instead in the West (""I know Enron doesn't even have a  western desk here."").  I believe that any proposal she comes back  with will entail his continuing in some trading  function.
 
        (2)    Liz  will try to determine how Calpine might provide assurances (acceptable to  ENA) that Miller is ""on the receiving end only,"" as she asserts, such that we  would be confident that he is indeed not in a position to use any trade  secrets he may remember.
   
                 --On this point, I was clear that I did not know either what level of assurance  ENA would require or whether this would even be a feasible  alternative.
     
         (3)    I am to explore with ENA whether this additional  information about Calpine's difference in trading strategy and the limitations  on Miller's duties alleviates ENA's concerns about protection of its trade  secrets.
 
                 --Liz seems to believe that if the business people really knew the information  she is giving to me, they would not be concerned about the activities of this  low level person.
 
     Liz has asked that we reconnect later this week to exchange answers to  these inquiries.  I look forward to discussing with you our  response.
 
     Thanks for your assistance.
 
Best  regards,
Linda  Broocks

Subject: RE:


I like that there is some sort of formal process based on peer group.  
 
I also like that they have made a decision to have ranking in the commercial groups.  It looks like they are being ranked to measure performance, not for compensation.  If so, then it would be nice for there to be some rough correlation to compensation.  If not, then what are the criteria for determining the bonus amounts?  If it is P&L and some other components, then let's specify what they are.  My biggest concern with all of this flexibility is that decisions will appear arbitrary with no clear basis for distinguishing between persons at the top of the bonus range and persons in the bottom.
 
On non-commercial, will there be a further breakdown within the 80?  If so, will those correlate to bonus amounts?  If not, same question as above.
 
I understand that market forces may drive many of these bonus decisions.  If so, then I believe that we simply should articulate them and be prepared to explain the bases for bonus payment amounts.
 
Promotion process looks good.
 
Assistants and clerks looks good, although it looks like OOC will decide bonus amounts.  If this is a fixed amount based on the rating, then that is ok.  Otherwise, if they are not pretty standardized, the same issues arise as above.  I
 
I expect that the same kinds of questions will arise for all business unit plans.
 
Hope this helps.  Let me know if you want to discuss or would like to talk through pay criteria.

Here is our plan on PRC. 

Assistants: 

Ranked 1,2,3 by supervisors - pay determined by Me and Louise.  No meetings. 

Non Commercial but in North America: 

Traditional ranking with the correct people addending the meetings.  Pay grid determined by OOC. 

Analysts and Associates 

Ranked as per Billy Lemmons %'s and then pay grid determined by OOC 
I would like to see 25% - 65% - 10%.  Billy disagrees.  This would provide for a quick meeting rather than trying to split them into 4 groups with the top one excluding some awesome people.

Managers/Directors 

Ranked from 1 to 100 in as many clusters as the groups see fit.  We are going to combine managers and directors into one table.  The ranking is based on this years performance is directly related to pay.  We will have two meetingss - one for traders and one for other commercial staff (orig/finance/etc).  We will not have a pay prc but will take the results of the rankings and work with individual leaders after the meetings to ensure the appropriate compensation.

We will also determine promotions during this meeting using different criteria. 

VP's 

We will rank all our VP's from 1 to 100 with a group of selected people - some VP's and some MD's.  
This too will be directly related to pay. 

Cheers as you Brits say

After weeks of consideration, I executed the Separation Agreement and Release to be paid via wire transfer on November 28th.  You were not available, but I left it with Michelle Cash for delivery to you this evening.  I would like payment under this Agreement by wire transfer on Wednesday.  I have made certain those I work with closely know I am available to completely transition as per the terms of the agreement.  

Please execute this Separation Agreement and Release and I will arrange to pick up a copy of this fully executed Agreement tomorrow morning.   Should you have any questions, I will be available at my office number -  713-853-3411.

"RE: Retention Agreement","Gene,

John D and I discussed getting draft retention agreements faxed to me for the top 15 tomorrow morning. A few of the numbers have changed and I would anticipate will change further after John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen begin serious discussions. With that in mind I propose that we work from faxed copies initially and when I have a clear understanding they are ready to sign I will send you a email or voicemail and ask you to send down an original in executable form (bearing in mind this may much later if it turns out you do not become our initial partner prior to auction).

Comments:
Michelle:  I hope you will remember me.  We graduated from law school together and I used to see you on occasion downtown when you were with Bracewell & Patterson.
Congrats on your move to Enron.  It sounds like such a dynamic place to work.
I am looking for new employment and have always been interested in going in-house.  I have been doing commercial and mass tort litigation for the last 12 years at Woodard, Hall & Primm and I am ready for a change.  I am open to changing my whole career focus away from litigation if I can find the right fit.
If you have time, I would love to talk to you about opportunities at Enron.  Lunch or anything would be great.  I can also send you my resume if that will help.  Any advice would be appreciated.
I hope all is well with you and your family.
You have my return e-mail address.  My phone is (713) 221-3835.
Thanks,
-Greg Clark

Subject:	RE: A few questions about the scripts

Mary, based on the most current information:  
1.	A&B employees will receive bonus consideration however the amount is not dependant or determined by their A / B designation.   Accordingly, any mention of bonus in the scripts will need to rely on what we have said in the past, I.E. Bonus will be dependant on financial performance and employee contributions over the past year.  
As result of this interpitation, Bonus, albeit a element of retention, should not be included as an inducement to retention at this time.  (source - Aaron Brown) 
2.	The employees on the D - list are being placed on paid furlough and being terminated at a known date in the future.  That period of earning calculated to be a severance plan offset.   Employees who work up to their specific term date ( C-list) will be receiving their normal pay; then their severance pay, without a severance plan offset.  Michelle Cash is working with Pat Mackin to define the severance plan features that will govern this timing and the corresponding explanations.

I have a couple of questions about the scripts that Rick Johnson sent me

1.  For A and B employees, will there be bonuses.  It's crossed out on the A script and left in the B script.
2.  In the C script:
	Please explain what a 60-day notice w/o severance plan off-set means.
	When does severance go into effect for C employees?  It's not clear in the script.

I spoke with YH Jo of Kim & Chang today. He would be prepared to act for us if we are able to pay a fee estimate in advance. I have briefed YH Jo on what we would require, ie:-

1.	Opinion on terminating 3 employees of ECT Korea and assisting in the actual termination (I forwarded the 3 employment contracts for preliminary review).
2.	Dealing with the Landlord of EI Korea regarding handover of the premises and recovering the security deposit.
3.	Deregistration of ECT Korea and EI Korea (including dealing with the freeze on the bank account, if necessary).
4.	Working with accountants (eg. PWC Korea) to sort out assets and liabilities, if required.

I have also asked for their fee estimate and account details if the advance payment is approved.

Alan - I have not copied Michelle cash and Scott Gilchrist on this note. Please advise if I should at this stage.

Will keep all advised.

"Proposed Discipline for  Internet Violations","
The proposed discipline below is designed to provide guidelines for HR generalists in addressing violations of the ""Internet Security Policy for the use of Electronic Media and Services"" to ensure consistency in the application of disciplinary measures.  In general, the discipline should follow the corrective action policy that has been established for addressing unacceptable conduct (see policy #11, corrective discipline). The recommendations below are designed to address situations where employees transmit externally electronic communication that is ""discriminatory, harassing, threatening, derogatory, obscene, defamatory, a ""chain letter"" or junk mail, untrue, fraudulent, illegal, against Company policy, contrary to the Company's interest or for personal profit"" (as outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics).

First Offense:  Automated electronic warning that the system has detected an inappropriate electronic mail being sent from the employee's mail box and that another violation will result in the HR Representative and Supervisor being notified and possible disciplinary action.  Also warning message refers employee to Internet Security Policy. 

Second Offense:  Second automated electronic warning to employee with copy to HR Rep and Supervisor.  HR Rep and Supervisor to verbally warn employee to ensure understanding of Company policy.

Third Offense:  Third automated electronic warning to employee with a copy to Supervisor and HR.  HR Rep and Supervisor to give Written warning to employee to be placed in PH file.  Written warning to state that further violation may result in termination. 

Fourth Offense:  System notice of shut down for continuing violation.  Copy of notice sent to HR Rep and Supervisor.  HR Rep and Supervisor to consult with Legal depart prior to employee termination for misconduct.

Using these guidelines, it is suggested that the  HR Rep and Management consider the specifics of the offense and determine the appropriate corrective action. 

Other Issues/Considerations:
Should we carve out transmissions that are ""untrue, fraudulent, illegal, against Company policy, contrary to the Company's interest and for personal profit"" and have a more severe discipline for those situations?
Should same discipline be used when employees access inappropriate or pornographic sites.
Should we attempt to define all terms?
Is it appropriate to use a ""one size fit's all"" approach.  Should the discipline for transmitting motivational messages be the same as discipline for a threatening, obscene, derogatory, etc. message?
How should we address inappropriate electronic messages transmitted internally?

Please route your comments to me or be prepared to discuss at our next meeting to be held Monday, July 23rd from 10:30 am to 11:30 am in EB 3824.

Subject:	Data request from counterparty

I have received an urgent data request from the counterparty for Netco.

They want the following asap:

Signed copies of contracts for Greg Whalley and Vince Kaminsky (who may not have a contract)
Sample signed agreement for a regular trader (presumably give one at vp and above and one below vp) -- I can get this from my files easily
Signed sample agreement for an IT person, such as Jay Webb (I think I can get this one as well).

They also want the following data for the 838:

	Name
	Position/title
	2000 total compensation (broken down by base, bonus, etc)
	Comp for 2001, broken down by base, bonus, etc.  (I'd exclude stay bonus in this number)
	If the person has a contract, what is the future value of the contract
	Did the person get a stay bonus last week?  If so, amount.
	Date of hire
	If under contract, beginning and end date of the term of that agreement.

They are in a rush for this data, so give me a call and let me know how quickly we can assemble it.

Thanks a lot!

Michelle, 
Here are some thoughts: 
If the benefits which require employees to be actually in attendance are insured benefits, it would be a good idea to contact the insurance company to see how the WARN leave of absence or furlough affects coverage under the group policy.  The insurance company may not pay the benefit regardless of what Enron wants to do.  If when the insurance company understands the circumstances, would be willing to pay a benefit to an employee on WARN leave of absence, then it would be a good idea to have the Welfare Benefits Plans Committee adopt a procedure for such insured plans that states employees on WARN leave of absence or furlough with pay are considered to be actively at work during such period that they are instructed not to come to their work location during such time. 
As to Section 2.3(e) of the Plan, we could either delete that section and add a six month active employment eligibility period with no service bridge to Section 2.1, or revise (e) to state the same thing.

"Enron Metals North America Voluntary Severance","Michele,
 
Per our telecon, the timeline to roll out the VR for Metals North America has been escalated to THURSDAY, October 18th which only leaves us tomorrow to try and tie up loose ends.
 
Attached 'NA Metals Analysis' spreadsheet will give you all the demographics of our population, include, ethnicity, gender, age, etc.  please note the 'standard' tabe includes everyone on Enron standard at-will employment letters.  The second tab 'agreement' has all our people on exec agreements.
 
The 'BU Briefing to Staff' will give you a good general overview of the program that was rolled out in EEL, I've red-lined the document to tweak it to the US side.
 
The employee info packet will include 'Enron Metals Change Program' document, 'VR Application' and 'FAQS.'  Again I've red-lined these EEL originated documents to fit the US side.  There are still some oustanding items I need to confirm with Comp & Ben.
 
My immediate questions are:

Will our current severance policy allow us to provide an enhanced voluntary program?
We want to offer it to all employees.  Can we do this and still reserve the right to reject applications?
If we do reject applications under the Voluntary Program will we be prevented from terminating the employee under the compulsory program?
Do we need to make any special consideration for employees on maternity leave ( I have three!!).

Please call me when you've had reviewed these items so we can determine how quickly we can move forward.

Thanks
Cathy

EIGHTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMS NLRB VIEW THAT TV STATION WORKERS NOT
SUPERVISORS

Substantial evidence supports the National Labor Relations
Board's ruling that a television station's assignment
editors and producers are not supervisors and therefore are
entitled to vote in a union election, the Eighth Circuit
rules (""Multimedia KSDK Inc. v. NLRB, ""8th Cir., No.
00-1684, 11/15/01). The appeals court agrees with the board
that KSDK-TV in St. Louis committed an unfair labor practice
by refusing to recognize International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers Local 4 as the bargaining representative
of a unit of news department assignment editors, producers,
and tape coordinators following the union's election win.
The television station refused to bargain, arguing the
assignment editors and producers are supervisors and
therefore not covered by the National Labor Relations Act.

The three-judge panel unanimously finds assignment editors
are not supervisors because they ""largely react to incoming
news sources"" and in ""a mechanical and routine process""
assign photographers and editors and coordinate lunch
breaks. However, the panel splits 2-1 on the producers, with
the majority finding they act within a ""collaborative
process"" and do not exercise sufficient independent
judgment. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

AVIATION SECURITY BILL CREATES FEDERAL SCREENER JOBS

The House and Senate approve a conference agreement on
aviation security (S. 1447) that creates a federalized
baggage screening workforce for two years, clearing the way
for President Bush's signature. The Senate passed the bill
on a voice vote, and the measure then passed the House on a
vote of 410-9.

Bush says he will sign the measure. In a statement, the
president commends members of the conference committee for
reaching agreement on a measure ""that puts the federal
government in charge of aviation security, making airline
travel safer for the American people."" The bill provides a
one-year transition period before the new system is put in
place, with the federal government immediately assuming
responsibility for all baggage screening. . . . Page A-11,

HOFFA DECLARES VICTORY OVER LEEDHAM IN TEAMSTERS ELECTION

Teamsters President James P. Hoffa declares victory in his
bid to continue leading the 1.4 million-member union for the
next five years. Hoffa took an early and decisive lead over
Tom Leedham, out-polling his challenger by about 2-to-1 in
the ballots counted in the first three days of the week-long
tallying process.  Leedham concedes defeat, posting a
statement on his campaign Web site saying he had been
""outspent 10-to-1 by an incumbent with a famous name.""

Flanked by members of his slate of executive board
candidates on the steps of the Teamsters headquarters near
Capitol Hill, Hoffa declares ""the membership has spoken loud
and clear"" by re-electing him. ""They want a union that is
democratic and united. They want a union that is fiscally
responsible, yet forward looking,"" he says. . . . Page A-1

EMPLOYER'S REQUEST OF LEAVE DELAY MAY HAVE CHILLED FMLA
RIGHTS

The Sands Hotel and Casino may have violated the Family and
Medical Leave Act rights of one of its employees by asking
him to delay his leave until after the Memorial Day weekend,
a federal judge in New Jersey rules, rejecting the
employer's motion for summary judgment  (""Shtab v. Greate
Bay Hotel and Casino Inc., ""D.N.J., No. 00-2122, 11/13/01).

 Ira Shtab, a cook at the hotel for five years, had sought
leave to care for his toddler son, who was
autistic.""[R]easonable persons could conclude that [the
human resource representative's] request 'chilled' Shtab's
assertion of his rights under the FMLA or could conclude
that Shtab's decision to take leave over the Memorial Day
weekend contributed to the Sands's ultimate denial of his
request,"" Judge Orlofsky holds, allowing the employee to
proceed to trial with his claim. . . . Page A-7

OSHA GUIDANCE ON ANTHRAX DISCUSSES RISKS, PRECAUTIONS FOR
BUSINESSES

OSHA issues promised guidance for employers responding to
anthrax exposure in the workplace. The ""anthrax matrix,""
available on the agency's Web site, organizes possible
employer responses according to the likelihood of
contamination and worker' exposure to the bacteria.
Workplaces are categorized into three zones according to
level of risk: a green zone, where contamination with
anthrax spores is unlikely; a yellow zone, where
contamination is possible; and a red zone, where public
health or law enforcement authorities have confirmed or
strongly suspect anthrax contamination, or where an
emergency response and clean-up effort is under way.

The level of risk in any particular workplace is based on
various factors, the guidance says. These include the
current pattern of contaminated workplaces, the likelihood a
particular workplace would be a target or would receive mail
or other items from a contaminated facility, and the type of
workplace where the threat is being assessed. ""Based on
information currently available, contamination with anthrax
spores ...  [is] unlikely in the vast majority of American
workplaces, represented by the green zone,"" the guidance
says.

Labor Secretary Chao cautions that the department is
providing needed guidance, not creating new requirements.
""The world has changed since Sept. 11,"" Chao says. ""Threats
to our national security now can clearly involve the
workplace."" . . . Page A-6

WORKER ALLEGING FORCED FMLA LEAVE FAILS TO SHOW ADVERSE JOB
ACT

A marketing graphics manager in Minnesota who alleged she
was constructively discharged after being forced to take
medical leave failed to establish that her employer violated
the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Minnesota Human
Rights Act, or the Family and Medical Leave Act, the U.S.
District Court for the District of Minnesota rules
(""Tremblay v. Liberty Enterprises Inc., ""D. Minn., No.
00-1983 (DWF/AJB), 11/9/01).

Each of Ruth A. Tremblay's claims required her to show that
she was subjected to an adverse job action, but she did not
meet that burden, Judge Frank finds, granting Liberty
Enterprises summary judgment on all the claims. ""[N]o
reasonable jury could conclude that the incidents described
by Tremblay were severe and pervasive enough to compel a
reasonable person to quit,"" Frank decides. . . . Page A-9

Per our conversations, I have two options from which to choose.  Accept another position within Enron by the end of October, or receive an involuntary severance package.  In order to fully understand these options and in order to make an informed decision, I feel it is necessary for me to be able to review the severance contract I will be required to sign.  Being asked to make this decision without access to the severance contract provisions denies me the capability to make an informed decision.

Subject:	Subsidiary Equity or Phantom Equity

Michelle,

This email confirms our discussion that one of the mandates of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Enron is that they approve all formations of and grants related to any subsidiary equity or phantom equity plans.

Mary and I can and will work closely and quickly with any group needing to get this done.  Mary is responsible for presenting the plan for approval to the Compensation Committee after Tax, Legal, Accounting, Commercial and HR interests are scrubbed.

These types of plans have accounting, legal and tax complexities that need to be worked out and change regularly.  Also, it is very important that no written or verbal promise related to equity grants before Compensation Committee approval is obtained.

Regards,
Aaron

Hello, George.  I hope all is well with you.
 
Below is a question from Mark Greenberg, an attorney here in EWS, about Arthur Andersen and whether we have some sort of Enron-wide agreement with them.  I would think that it would be in our best interests to have some sort of global agreement, particularly one with volume discounts in the event that all of Enron uses a certain level of service.
 
Is something like that in the works?  If not, do you believe that it would be useful?  If so, I would be happy to assist in drafting such an agreement.
 
I'm around all this week (except Wednesday when I'll be at a mediation) if you would like to discuss.
 
Thanks.
 
Michelle

Michelle - 

I left a message with Twanda for you to give me a call.  Lately I have been asked to review letter agreements between EWS and Arthur Anderson LLP for services to be provided by AA.  These services generally relate to having AA personnel work on EWS projects on Enron property (in our offices).  I have asked GSS if we have any global agreement that would cover this, but have been advised that the only AA agreement we have is an old one that has probably been rolled in to the Accenture LLP group - which is an offshoot AA and, as I understand it, not affiliated with AA any longer.

The concern with the letter agreements is that they favor AA in most all salient terms, contain non-solicit provisions and are sometimes not provided to Enron before the work has been initiated or, at times, completed.

It would seem to me that either a Corp. or EWS master agreement should be put in place to handle these. 

Let me know your thoughts and how you want to proceed. 

Thanks.

Michelle, if we can't set up with the respective employers, tax deductibility will be a key issue to resolve.  When will we know whether this has to be set up in a new employer entity or not?

Subject:	

Just got off conference call with Wachovia to review trust arrangement particularly to ensure that this is effective in not triggering tax until time of payment rather than triggering tax at funding of trust.  We think this arrangement does that as long as the following is true:
Funds put in trust should not be paid out until 2002 to provide for ""service period/vesting"" requirement
Must be irrevocable i.e. funds can never come back to employer so need to be careful not to overfund

Also, to keep from being subject to ERISA, need to assume that payments are not delayed until termination.  (IF subject to ERISA, creates ugly reporting/compliance issues and discrimination testing.....)

 The issue of whether to set up a new employer i.d. to hold the trust is a question - might provide more security and protection in the event of bankruptcy but might create tax deductibility issues.  Might be better if we could set up subparts for different employers to ensure tax deductibility.  I will run by external tax counsel with utmost discretion.  

If this is to be used for non-U.S. employees, need to ensure arrangement doesn't trigger taxable event at funding due to local tax law.  May not be an issue.

Are we contemplating including any insiders?

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Following our conversation this morning, I would add 2 further points:

- John D agreed we could add something to 1b that explains what %age of bonus is paid in rest stock (i.e. 25% with a 25% discount) and it's vesting period.
- Additionally, my commercial guys would like to see 10 removed given a perceived overlap with 9. Can you let me know whether this is OK with you?

With above and the discussion we had earlier on a couple of other points, could we get a final version?

David,

For clarification, I was present during Mark Stubley's brief training
session over the phone.  I memorialized the key points in a summary email.
Let me know if you or anyone else would like a copy of it.

On the issue of Ogletree training, I had mentioned that it might be more
cost efficient to have someone in Florida conduct the training.  Mike had
indicated a preference to use Mark Stubley at Ogletree.  Of course, since
Mark has done it for us in the past, I am ok with him doing it as well.  I
just was looking at the outside expenditures, as we all have been doing
lately (particularly outside counsel bills), and thought that there may be
some cost savings.  In some circumstances, outside counsel who have to
travel cut their rates a bit for travel time (don't know if Stubley does
that), so the cost differential could be minimal, but I thought I'd raise it
since there are qualified attorneys in Florida who could assist in that
arena.

I'll give Mark a call to finalize the issue of local counsel, which I do not
believe to be significant.  Because Mark has contacted them, they already
have run a conflict check and are ready to go.  All it would take to get
them ""engaged"" would be a phone call.  There should not be any cost incurred
at this point, because they only are on standby, so I think it is good to
line them up.  I'll let you know if Jim Derrick has any issue with their
recommendation.  I also have received recommendations for top-notch local
labor counsel in Florida if we choose to go that route.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Mike,

I know of no hold up here.  I spoke to Michelle Cash and she had not

withheld or said different to retaining this counsel.  I would suggest that

you call Michelle (713-853-6401) anytime you have a concern with regard to

the progress of any labor and employment matter handled by outside or inside

counsel.  And if Stubley is concerned about who he would like to work with

in Florida, he is equally able to call Michelle and discuss it.

As for a review of the training on union avoidance by Ogletree Deakins, by

copy to Michelle, I'll ask for her input here.

I saw the correspondence from Mr. Fitzgerald regarding his meeting with the

Mayor of Lake Worth.  I interpret this as a public official saying what is

expected, neither favoring the picketers or us, just saying he will up-hold

the law.  We appreciate that.

at the site. No

The revised report indicates that a new goal has beed identified for females in the Associate pool.  Availability is at 33.64% and current utilization is 21.10%.  At the current utilization rate, a shortfall of 13 females exists in the Associate pool.  This is a change from the

Team
FYI

Sheri
The 3 SME's that have already committed to being on film need to be keep in
the lope regarding the timeline. Also check with these 2 SME's for
additional candidates (i.e. check with Mark Reese to see if Lamar Frazier
would be interested). I would like to be conferenced in on the media calls
& meetings. Also cc me on their emails or forward to me  their  emails.
This will keep me in the loop. Thanks

Phillip
If you have some additional people in mind, we need them identified as soon
as possible. Thanks

Cheers
Kirk

Kirk -

Thank you for helping us work towards sign-off from Enron Legal. Seeing as
you haven't been closely involved, I thought you'd like an update on our
media production tasks.

As you know, we are completing our planning phase for the production of the
storyline scripts. Our media vendor, Cramer, has been extremely helpful and
enjoyable to work with.  Below is an email from Steve, the director for our
storyline video, explaining where we are in the production process.

Have a good day!

Hey Sheri,
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving! I can't believe it's over
already! Anyway...we've shuffled the schedule around, securing the 6th and
7th of
December for the shoot in the studio. We're working on finalizing the
edit dates to reflect that shift. Chris is moving to hold all talent for
those dates.

I guess it's now in the hands of legal! As soon as we confirm the edit
suite
availability
we'll revise and post the new schedule. We're scheduled for our weekly call
tomorrow but if
anything comes up just give me a buzz!
Thanks Sheri!
Steve

Hello Steve and Chris -

Recently, there were changes to the overall number of our scenarios in our
simulation. There will be seven scenarios versus the nine we have been
discussing. These changes result in:
        Deletion of 2 intro and 2 exit videos
        Deletion of six interview questions (see more detail below)
        No additional characters. We will still need all characters (and
        talent) that we have casted for.

Laura has been working with John to make the required edits to the scripts.
We have recieved today (mid-day).

Based on our last discussion, I'd like to recommend we set the date for our
shoot for the end of the first week in Dec. Specifically, Dec. 6th and 7th.
This recommendation is based on the response I received from our project
manager in regards to the time it will take to have Legal review our
scripts.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you and have a
wonderful Thanksgiving!

I was wondering if circumstances with Jonathan Lane (the contract Help desk person whom I mentioned to you a week or so ago) have been resolved?  When we last spoke I mentioned that he went to Valeria Hope's group.  I am not sure of the outcome  of that visit, but I will tell  you that his negative attitude and general dissatisfaction on the team is becoming disruptive to the other help desk members. He is away from his desk often (having ""meetings"", which may be interviews for other positions), he has shared with the other team members his perceptions of management and his issues with us.  

If and when I can do so, I would like to terminate him.  I won't until I hear from you all, and we are documenting discussions as you requested.  I hope this can end soon, though because this is causing real problems here.

I do think transferring all Netco employees to ENA would be effective.  We easily could do a master assignment of all the employment agreements on a single document that does not have to be signed by the employees.  For those without assignment clause, we could do a document in which the employee agrees and consents to the assignment to ENA and to any other company that may buy the trading business of ENA.

On visa issues, I agree with your approach, although would suggest that no deal with T&F is possible given that we already owe them over $150K on pre-petition fees.

I don't think the deal team or counterparty would have any say in this.  We will let them know that all relevant employees are in ENA, and that should do it.

David/Michelle

Based on your knowledge of the deal structure :

1 ) Do you think that we should transfer all Netco employees to ENA w.e.f 1/1/01. (from ENW/CORP etc) and at the same time do letters confirming assignment of EEA's for those on EEA's with Corp/ENW etc who have an assignment clause. Also suggest we ask those who do not have the assignment term in their agreement to sign an amendment to their agreement assigning the contract to ENA.

2) Also as we are likely to apply for new H1 visas for all L1 visas - I would think it makes sense for new visa's this to be with ENA - as I assume this is the most likely company to be part of the acquisition ? Therefore we will need to do transfer letters for those employees who are not ENA employees as part of this exercise. Tyndall and Forster will probably require an upfront payment to apply for these visa's - @ $3,500 + $1000 for the premium processing. Therefore we will need to cut a cheque to them for (18 L1 transfers) of circa $ 80,000 - we may be able to negotiate  this down some.
We can then if necessary transfer over the H1's at the appropriate time to the new entity.

We should try to get these exercises to coincide.

David/MIchelle - can you discuss this approach with the deal team/counterparty - especially 1 (as 2 seems a no brainer).

David,

Tim is working on the international employee issues. This employee is a domestic employee.

I just spoke with Citicapital and they are not making any expenditures on behalf of Enron.  They will not release these funds because they are not on the preferred vendor list on the first day order.  They are concerned that the Court will request all funds ($4 Million advanced for international moves, $7.2 million paid for outstanding invoices, funds received from home closings) to be returned.

We have been trying to get answers to the relocation questions since yesterday.  We were talking with MaryJean Potenzone, but I think she was relying on another attorney for these answers.  At this time, we have not been authorized to make any payments to our relocation vendors.

We also have another employee who has his furniture on a moving van.  The relocation company will not release the furniture unless they receive pay from either Enron or the employee.  This employee was terminated on Monday and will be evicted from his corporate housing today.  He has been calling me since Monday for answers, but I do not have anything to tell him.

Do you have any suggestions as to how to get answers to our relocation questions?

Thanks for any assistance you can give me.

Diane

2. If not the entire amount, why can not the equity amount minus realtor fees be processed immediately?
3. Will I be paid interest on the my equity amount Citi is holding?

"RE: A few questions about the scripts","Mary, based on the most current information:  
1.	A&B employees will receive bonus consideration however the amount is not dependant or determined by their A / B designation.   Accordingly, any mention of bonus in the scripts will need to rely on what we have said in the past, I.E. Bonus will be dependant on financial performance and employee contributions over the past year.  
As result of this interpitation, Bonus, albeit a element of retention, should not be included as an inducement to retention at this time.  (source - Aaron Brown) 
2.	The employees on the D - list are being placed on paid furlough and being terminated at a known date in the future.  That period of earning calculated to be a severance plan offset.   Employees who work up to their specific term date ( C-list) will be receiving their normal pay; then their severance pay, without a severance plan offset.  Michelle Cash is working with Pat Mackin to define the severance plan features that will govern this timing and the corresponding explanations.

Michelle,
What would you suggest?  To jog your memory, Infinity is the outsourcing group Freight Markets is using in Chicago?not for recruiting at all.  Should we just add a PWD (or whatever they're called) reflecting the different rate for the Director?

Thanks!
Amy

Amy,

Who do I need to talk to about changes to our Infinity Customer Solutions contract?

We have added a supervisor at a different rate per month and I think the contract should reflect that.

Thanks

SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES NOMINATION OF SCALIA FOR LABOR
SOLICITOR

By a vote of 11-10, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and
Pensions Committee approves President Bush's nomination of
Eugene Scalia to hold the Labor Department's top legal
position. Sen. Jeffords (I-Vt.) is the sole member of the
Democratic caucus to vote in favor of Scalia to be solicitor
of labor.

In discussion before the vote, Democrats protest the
nomination, citing Scalia's written positions on a number of
issues, including workplace safety, discrimination, and
child labor. Republicans on the committee respond that
Scalia's record shows nothing but the successful career of
an aggressive lawyer.

The committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Gregg (R-N.H.) ,
says Scalia has ""a brilliant mind"" and is ""exactly what we
should be looking for"" in a public servant. Bush's
nomination of Scalia, an employment lawyer and partner in
the Washington, D.C., office of Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher,
has drawn criticism from congressional Democrats and the
AFL-CIO, largely due to his critical views of the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration's effort to
regulate ergonomics in the workplace. . . . Page AA-1

NLRB REAFFIRMS MERE NEGLIGENCE IN HIRING HALL REFERRAL NOT
ILLEGAL

On remand from an appeals court, the National Labor
Relations Board reaffirms its previous view that a union's
inadvertent errors in operating an exclusive hiring hall do
not violate the union's duty of fair representation or
constitute an unfair labor practice (""Steamfitters Local 342
(Contra Costa Elec. Inc.), ""336 N.L.R.B. No. 44, 9/28/01
[released 10/15/01]). The board first ruled 4-1 in September
1999 that Steamfitters Local 342 did not act illegally by
mistakenly referring several lower-priority workers to a
construction project, ahead of union member Joe Jacoby.
However, the District of Columbia Circuit reversed and
remanded the case, directing the board to reconsider its
reasoning.

In its second decision, the board again rules the
Steamfitters' mistake in not referring Jacoby right away did
not violate the union's duty of fair representation or
constitute an unfair labor practice because the mistake was
not deliberate. The board again overrules its 1992 decision
in ""California Erectors"" and other later decisions that take
an inconsistent view. The board relies on board decisions
prior to 1992, instead of the two Supreme Court decisions it
relied on in its first decision in the case. . . . Page A-6

ASSISTANCE PLAN TARGETED TO WORKERS 'IN NEED,' CHAO SAYS

Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao tells the House Education and
Workforce Committee that President Bush's recent plan to
assist dislocated workers is an ""extremely nimble"" proposal,
one that is ""targeted at workers in need."" Bush has
announced plans to make available a new package of
unemployment insurance benefits and emergency grants for
states hard hit by job losses related to the disaster. Labor
Department estimates put the cost of the 13 weeks of
additional unemployment insurance benefits, which would be
available for an 18-month period, at between $5 billion and
$8 billion.

 The benefits would be available to those who have exhausted
their 26 weeks of regular unemployment insurance in states
where the total unemployment rate has increased 30 percent
above the Sept. 11 level. According to Labor Department
calculations, between 2.2 million and 2.3 million unemployed
workers would receive assistance under the new program, Chao
says. Bush also has proposed that $3 billion of the $40
billion emergency supplemental appropriations be made
available in the form of national emergency grants to states
experiencing mass layoffs or plant closings. These grants
could be used as cash payments for workers to pay health
care premiums, cover job training costs, or extend financial
assistance to those who otherwise are not  eligible. . . .

COURT DENIES CLASS CERTIFICATION IN RACE CASE AGAINST
GEORGIA UTILITY

A federal judge in Atlanta denies class certification in a
race discrimination lawsuit against Atlanta-based electric
utility the Southern Co. and its subsidiary Georgia Power
Co., ruling that the claims of the potential class members
were not sufficient to show a widespread pattern and
practice of discrimination ( ""Cooper v. Southern Co., ""N.D.
Ga., No. 1:00-CV-2231, 10/11/01 ).

In a 90-page opinion, Judge Evans of the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Georgia also finds that the
case, brought by seven present and past employees of Georgia
Power and the Southern Co., would be overwhelmed by the
individual claims of the proposed class of 2,400 African
American employees and that a class action was an
inefficient means for bringing the claims.

The suit, filed in July 2000, alleged a pattern and practice
of discrimination against African American employees with
respect to job opportunities--including opportunities for
advancement and promotion--as well as ""reckless indifference
to a workplace environment that breeds racial animus."" At
the core of the harassment complaints were charges that
nooses were a widespread fixture throughout the workplace. .

STARING ACTIONABLE UNDER CALIFORNIA SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAW,
COURT SAYS

An assembly line employee who said a co-worker stared at her
several times a day, sometimes for five to 10 minutes at a
time, after she complained to management about his unwelcome
sexual advances sufficiently stated a claim for sexual
harassment under California's Fair Employment and Housing
Act, the California Court of Appeal rules (""Birschtein v.
New United Motor Manufacturing Inc.,  ""Cal. Ct. App.,  No.
A090680,  10/9/01).

Reversing summary judgment for New United Motor
Manufacturing Inc., the court says Michelle Birschtein can
take to the jury her claim that co-worker George Bonillia's
actions violated FEHA's ban on workplace sexual harassment.
In addition, the court rules that Birschtein presented a
triable issue as to whether her claims of sexual harassment
occurring outside FEHA's one-year statute of limitations
were part of a series of sexually harassing events that
created a continuing violation of the act.  Finally, the
court reinstates her retaliation claim, rejecting the
employer's argument that the claim failed because Birschtein
did not allege the employer took an adverse action against
her. . . . Page A-5

Subject:	RE: YEAR-END PROCESS

OK. 

Greg, my recommendation is that we send out a note from ENE OTC saying, ""ENE OTC is going to let BU's use their judgment on the PRC and evaluation process at this year end, given the rather extraordinary circumstances we find ourselves in.. In that way if Stan wants to go ahead as below but EEL doesn't (which I believe is accurate) we can cater for what each team think is right for their people.

What do you think?

Subject:	YEAR-END PROCESS
Importance:	High

Attached below are two documents I would like to share with the EGS management team and all EGS employees this week.  They describe the year-end evaluation and compensation process and are consistent with ENE's previously stated intentions.  I am meeting with the EGS officers tomorrow (November 15) and will review the ""EGS Presentation"" with them.  Subsequently, I plan to send a memo to EGS employees on Friday, November 16, describing the year-end process we intend to follow (""EGS Memo"").  Let me know if there are reasons why I need to delay or modify this plan.

Thanks,
Stan

"Retention Agreement","Mich,

Lavo wants to do following:

Draft a cover letter that says ""Attached is form of retention agreement which will be good at the conclusion of the auction on Jan 10/11, no matter who the counter party is, providing however that the successful bidder will at least 1. Have a bonus pool of at least 15% of EBIT if NETCO makes it forecasted earnings 2. Is at least AA credit rated 3. Agrees to the other provisions in the draft ASA relative to honoring Enron service and other employee matters.
Take the Citibank doc we have been working on and make necessary amendments to remove references to counter party.
We may need to give ourselves some wiggle room on how retention and bonus awards may vest.

Can we get a draft of above this morning?

He's meeting later today with Mary Joyce and said he'll get back to me.  I did not inquire specifically about NuTech--I assume Michelle is doing that.

Teresa





Aaron:

Based on our conversations, it is my understanding that the compensation committee has asked to review compensation plans for our affiliates if we own approximately 50% or more of the company.  The determination of exactly which plans must go to the committee will be made by Mary Joyce upon receipt of a bullet point presentation of the key terms of the plan.  The committee would likely review any compensation plan pursuant to which (i) employees receive equity interests without making capital contributions in cash or other property with reasonably equivalent value to the equity interests, (ii) employees receive equity interests prior to Enron recovering its investment, or (iii) employees are to be offered employment agreements with terms that are not within ""Enron norms.""  In addition, all significant terms of the compensation plan are to be disclosed in the DASH.

Do I understand this all corrrectly?  Is there anything I have omitted?

If the committee meets only quarterly, timing could certainly be an issue in some transactions.  If that is the case, can special meetings be called?

Here is the first response I received from one of our senior partners in SF:

I think the best thing such a client can do is to use a reputable security
outfit (such as Kroll Associates) to give the co. a very thorough
assessment. I think, quite frankly, that relying on the advice of such an
outfit would provide more legal protection than talking to all of the
lawyers in the world, although our advice could be an additional benefit.

As you know, we have an extensive task force report on workplace violence
that would be relevant to this inquiry and could provide the basis for an
analysis of this issue, although other areas would have to be explored.

I am soliciting comments about the HR consultant you referenced.

Lizzette,

The plan is that effective Jan. 2002 FMLA and Enron's sick leave will run concurrently.  We are also going to have ""tier"" information - meaning that HR people will view more policy information than the basic employee will.  Do you have any suggestions on what should be included in the tier information for HR regarding FMLA and or sick leave.  At the very least I think we should make it clear that HR is responsible for sending the FMLA notice letter out to employees when they are out sick and HR believes that the illness may fall under FMLA.  What are your thoughts?


Thanks,
Sarah

My understanding of our current position on this is to give one month's pay to applicants who: 1. quit a job; 2. sold a home or relocated; or 3. have visa issues.  I suggest we confer on any request regarding paying anyone who doesn't fit the above.  If we do so, we should be able to maintain some consistency.

I am generating a form waiver and release for use in cases in which we decide to pay an individual whose offer has been revoked.  I'll forward a draft to you shortly.  If you have other forms or suggestions, please forward them to me.  Hopefully, we'll all be able to be consistent and use just one form.

 <<analysis revision 3.xls>> 
Kriste: 
Here is a chart prepared by our statistician indicating adverse impact based on the spreadsheet that we received on Monday.  As we have discussed before, the more relevant statistics are the job group numbers and not the gross statistics.  Allan King also called me after he sent me this and said that Rob Speakman (the statistician) also said that he was able to compare the HR staff selected for layoff versus the HR general population and there was statistically significant adverse impact of 10 on gender and 12 on African-American.  He asked if this group was selected as a group or if this was an amalgamation of HR employees from the various operating companies.  I said that I thought that there was at least a component of a centralized decisionmaking.  Accordingly, we probably need to discuss those statistics.  Give me a call when you receive this.

Subject:	Jobsite Visit by Union Organizer - Lake Worth Repowering
Project

On Tuesday October 9th I received a call @ 9:20 am from Greg Renz, Resident
Engineer, that Joe Osler, Construction Manager was in a meeting at the
jobsite with union organizers. I immediately notified Bob Black and Mike
Indivero by phone. I arrived on site about 9:40 and went to Tommy
Cutrer's(Electrical Supt.) office and met with Joe, Tommy, Paul Wedell,
Union Organizer for Local #630 of U. A. of  Plumbers and Pipefitters of the
United States and Canada(based in West Palm Beach) and Otis (didn't get his
last name) who we believe to be the Business Agent. Joe introduced me as the
Site HR Manager and Otis offered us 1100 pipefitters and welders to do the
mechanical work on this project. I told them that we were not in a position
to take applications for pipefitters and welders because it was early  in
the project and we have only 2 opening for carpenter helpers posted with the
work force development commission. I told them at some time we would be
hiring pipefitters and welders and they could apply for those positions at
that time. I told them that we do not discriminate against anyone because of
age, sex, race, religion or union affiliation. Otis the business agent asked
if we were bringing all our people from outside the area. I  told them that
Nepco has an Office in Lakeland, FL. where we are finishing up a power
project and we would be offering employment to former employees who wanted
to work in this part of the state. I told them that any of our unfilled
needs would be filled by qualified craft personnel and that we would be
happy to consider their applications. I exchanged business cards with Paul
Wadell and told him to call me later in the month and let him know where our
offsite employment was located. They left the jobsite.

Joe said that the conversations that occured prior to my arrival were not
about our hiring policies. Joe deferred the hiring issues to me which is
what Mark Stubley's recommendation were during our last conference call. Joe
did an excellent job in keeping the hiring issues to a single point of
contact. After they left Joe and I discussed several issues which we are
moving on as quickly as possible. They are as follows.

1. Get ready for an OSHA or other Official visit in case the Union Organizer
wants to be disruptive. Already prepped the site at 7:00 am Tuesday for
visitors.

2. Made sure safety supervisor was on site and available to escort any
visitors.

3. Contacted security company about implementing 24 hour patrols and single
access gate.

4. Contacted fencing company to review fencing plan.

5. Instructed safety supervisor to place red barricade tape around jobsite
perimeter with gates and signs to direct all employees and visitors to
authorized access areas.

6. May want to consider ID badging system for Employees, Home Office
Visitors, Vendors, Escorted and Unescorted badges. Keep Visitors/ Staff
employee log for times when anyone enters or leaves the jobsite.

7. Have 1 project pager assigned to a different staff person each week to be
the point of contact in case anything happens on site after hours that needs
to be addressed.

8. I will get in touch with Carroll Scott with Fluor Daniel and Leonard
Wallace with Foster Wheeler to see if they have any background on
Pipefitters Local #630 and how serious an organizing campaign they might be
willing to mount against Nepco.

9. Establish a project contingency plan on what to do if we have pickets at
the gate.

10. Find out who we have as local counsel and notify them of this contact
and what they might know about previous ULP's and organizing efforts by
Local #630.

11. Contact Mark Stubley with Ogletree Deakins and advise him of this visit.
Consider accelerating the Labor Relations Training date that was planned for
Nov. with Bob King of Ogletree Deakins.

12. Have Tommy Cutrer, Joe Osler and Greg Renz write statements about what
they said during their visit.

13. Post the property we control with signs that prohibit use of
photographic, video or audio recording equipment on the property unless
authorized by Mr. Osler.

14. Establish a Jobsite file maintained by the HR Site Manager of all union
related activities and contacts to be used in our defense of any ULP
charges.

If I think of anything else I'll let you know.

ILLINOIS HUMAN RIGHTS DEPARTMENT PROCEDURES RULED
UNCONSTITUTIONAL

Certain procedures used by the Illinois Department of Human
Rights to investigate employment discrimination complaints
violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois rules (""Cooper v. Salazar,
""N.D. Ill.,  No. 98-C-2930,  11/1/01).

Judge Shadur grants summary judgment to the plaintiffs, a
class of discrimination complainants led by Ricky Cooper, on
their due process claims against department director Carlos
J. Salazar. The court orders the department to stop relying
on witness credibility determinations made without affording
complainants an opportunity to confront and cross examine
witnesses against them.

The court also orders Salazar to allow complainants seeking
review of the department's decision not to pursue their
cases access to documents in their investigative files.
Finally, the court orders the department to modify certain
review procedures to protect the plaintiffs' due process
rights. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-54

SEVEN UNIONS, PIPELINE FIRM CHALLENGE OKLAHOMA'S
RIGHT-TO-WORK LAW

Seven unions and a pipeline services company file suit
seeking to overturn Oklahoma's newly adopted right-to-work
law, which prohibits union-security clauses in bargaining
contracts, bans union hiring halls, and requires individual
employee approval for union dues to be deducted from a
paycheck (""Local 514, Transport Workers Union v. Oklahoma,
""E.D. Okla., No. 01-633-S, ""suit filed"" 11/13/01). State
Question 695 was approved by 54 percent of the voters in a
special election Sept. 25.

The lawsuit filed in federal court in Oklahoma alleges that
SQ 695 violates the supremacy clause of the U.S.
Constitution and is preempted by the National Labor
Relations Act, the Railway Labor Act, the Postal
Reorganization Act, and the Civil Service Reform Act. The
challengers also allege SQ 695 violates the Oklahoma
Constitution's amendment procedures and constitutes a
prohibited ""special law"" not applying to any other types of
membership organizations. The suit asks the court to declare
the constitutional amendment invalid and to permanently
enjoin state officials from enforcing it. . . . Page A-2

EEOC WILL STILL INVESTIGATE ADA CHARGES AFTER ""GARRETT""

The EEOC is advising its district directors to continue
processing and investigating disability discrimination
charges against state government employers, despite the U.S.
Supreme Court's ruling that individuals can no longer sue
those employers for monetary relief under the Americans with
Disabilities Act.

Such individual suits were barred by the U.S. Supreme
Court's February decision in ""Board of Trustees of the
University of Alabama v. Garrett. "" However, the EEOC memo
advises that the agency will continue to investigate these
charges and refer them for mediation and continue to
coordinate charges that have ""litigation potential"" with the
Department of Justice.

The commission observes that the ""severe limitations"" placed
on private lawsuits by the ""Garrett "" ruling makes its own
enforcement role ""more important than ever."" But a former
general counsel sees the directive as ""wishful thinking"" on
the part of the civil rights enforcement agency. . . . Page

BUSH SIGNS AIRPORT SECURITY BILL TO FEDERALIZE SCREENERS

President Bush signs into law a bill (S. 1447, Conf. Rep.
107-296) that will place all responsibility for airport
security into the hands of the federal government and
federalize virtually all airport baggage screeners within
one year. Organized labor's reaction to the measure has been
largely positive, but unions that represent federal workers
are questioning the status of baggage screeners after they
become federal employees.

The measure calls for a new undersecretary of transportation
for security who will ""be responsible for hiring and
training personnel to provide security screening at all
airports in the United States."" The American Federation of
Government Employees says it is ""alarmed and disappointed""
that the report does not ensure federal employee screeners
have the same rights as other employees.

Meanwhile, flight attendants' and pilots' unions applaud the
bill's passage, noting that it contains many features that
have long been priorities in their organizations. Of
particular importance to the Association of Flight
Attendants was a provision that requires screening of all
checked bags. . . . Page A-9,  Text E-1

SIXTH CIRCUIT REJECTS RETALIATORY FIRING CLAIM IN FAMILY
LEAVE SUIT

The Sixth Circuit rejects a retaliatory discharge claim
filed by an employee who claimed Great Lakes Power Service
Co. fired him  ""in retaliation for ""intending"" to take his
statutorily protected 12 weeks of leave"" (""Skrjanc v. Great
Lakes Power Serv. Co., "" 6th Cir., No. 00-3726,  11/14/01).
""The right to actually take 12 weeks of leave pursuant to
the FMLA includes the right to declare an intention to take
such leave in the future,"" the court says. It finds Michael
Skrjanc, however, failed to show that because he invoked his
FMLA rights, he was treated differently than similarly
situated employees.

 Skrjanc was discharged at the same time the company was
divesting itself of its pump unit, where he worked. The
three other people who also worked in the pump unit were
fired as well, the court points out. All four of the pump
unit employees were fired, none was considered for a new
position, and Skrjanc failed to show that Great Lakes had a
history of considering employees for transfer when their
positions were eliminated, the court says. . . . Page A-1

I agree with your assessment.  My one concern is their statement about intellectual property, as we generally are pretty tough about ownership of IP -- although I believe we can draft around that.

Either I or Lizzette Palmer can assist in the drafting of this arrangement.

Brent,

please send a C.A. template to Riaz Siddiqi, Pres and CEO at Capstone Global Energy LLC. His email address is rsiddiqi@capstoneenergy.com.

We need the CA to cover a few things.  We plan to work together to offer corporate risk management solutions focused around weather.  We've targeted 3 customers to start on:  DTE, Connectiv, and First Energy.

The CA needs to address 3 things (we think):
1. the concept of working together to create these solutions
2. the specific clients
3. ideas we come up with

I assume ""protected ideas"" would need to be documented and stamped ""confidential"".

I know this is a pain - they want it and as a consulting company, intellectual property is all they really have.  And we know how you hate to start with someone else's CA... but we can get theirs if you'd like.

Gary

"Jane Beatty letter & contract","Michelle,
Will you please review the attached and initial if you approve the way it reads?  We technically hired Jo Crowder as our first hire, but didn't see the sense in paying the remaining $20K of her $50K retainer fee for someone who is at a Staff level.  I've discussed this arrangement with Jane and she is in agreement.  (Twanda, do you mind printing this on EGM letterhead for Michelle to initial?  I'm happy to come pick it up, or you can send to me at ECN 3678a. Thanks!)
 
Additionally, we would like to extend Jane's contract so she can continue to submit candidates to us.  Her original contract ended on September 30th.  We'd like to extend it for a six month term beginning October 1st, continuing through March 31st.  I've spoken with Jane and she agrees that there will not be an additional retainer fee charged to us by reinstating our contract.  (Diane, is this as easy as just running new executable copies of the contract, changing only the dates or would we just create a one page amendment to the existing contract for signature by all parties?).  We would like to continue working with them under the same fee structure as though our contract with them never ended (i.e. our next hire will be at a 25% fee).

Thanks for your help, ladies!  Let me know if there's anything else I can do to assist!
