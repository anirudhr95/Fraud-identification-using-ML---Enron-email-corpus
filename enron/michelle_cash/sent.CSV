"RE: Question from Vendor re Recruiting Agreement","Diane/Lizzette -- 

I would say that the background check issue is a business call.  They are the ones who require the background checks and the type of background checks.

Same with the guarantee language.  If there is a change, however, I would make it to the SSD instead of the main agreement.  That way, we won't have to live with it for every placement.

Subject:	Question from Vendor re Recruiting Agreement

Lizzette:

We got a call this morning from DBI (a contingency recruiting agency) regarding the Agreement. I've pulled this Agreement so you can see the specific language she is questioning.  She wants to modify the Agreement re the following:

	1.	Vendor wants to change Guarantee language so that she would provide:

			90-day unconditional guarantee (refund placement fee), or														120-day replacement of employee


	2.	With regard to background checks, her Agency checks employment references but does do the extensive background checks we generally require 			(verification of SS#, verification of address, state and district court check for criminal records, etc.)

		DBI has the Candidate sign an acknowledgement that all the information provided to her Agency is correct and that the candidate understands that falsification 		of data makes them subject to termination by the Employer.

		Bottom line -- she doesn't want to spend the money or hassle with the extensive background checks .

		What would you recommend?


		We're so glad you're here......

Subject: Former HPL Employees




        Attached is the final list of employees who transferred to AEP.  If any of these employees are considered for re-hire, please ensure 

        that the following procedure is followed: 

        1.      Any former HPL rehired into Enron must come in via a resume submitted to an open posted position.  (i.e. No slam dunks)

        2.      The candidate should be interviewed with other qualified candidates. (i.e. No single candidate on the job applicant summary).

        3.      If the candidate is offered a position, it cannot be at a higher level and/or higher salary (i.e Inducement).  FYI, all HPL

                employees received an increase when they started at AEP.   The exception to this is if they are being rehired into a 

                higher level position. 

        4.      All re-hires must sign a letter stating they were not solicited by Enron to return. 


        Please share this information with all recruiters, staffers and generalists.

"RE: Andrew Makk","Sarah,

At this time, I do not believe that this is a legal issue.  Mary Joyce, in Executive Compensation, approves all terms and conditions of VP employment agreements.  Before we agree to modify any non-compete, there must be buy-in from Mary first.  Only then would we consider the request from the legal perspective.  Even then, I am not sure that it is a precedent we would want to set for someone under a US agreement.

Michelle:
	By my calculation Alonzo Williams' answer date will be Dec. 26. He was
served on November 29. I haven't heard anything.
	It occurred to me that we often are successful in resolving these things
quickly and cheaply by having someone at Enron call a contact at the new
company, TXU, and bring the issue to a head. So far as I know no one has
made such a call in this case.  I recall from the Union litigation a few
years ago there was an Enron exec who went to TUFCO by the name of Mark
McNally. We deposed Mark in that case and he was very professional and
cooperative. McNally had been at Enron and (I believe) Houston Pipeline for
15-17 years. He's now been with TXU 4 or 5 years and is CFO. A call to him
might get this off dead center. I'm copying Mark on this email because I
know Mark knows McNally well.
	What do you think?
	Best regards,
	Bill

Subject:	Employment Tax Refund Project

Michelle,

As I indicated in my voice mail this morning, I am working with Janice
Priddy, Manager of Enron Corporate Payroll, on a significant employment tax
refund project.  We are in the process of quantifying potential FICA,
federal unemployment and state unemployment tax refunds related to both
internal and external acquisitions involving employees.  Essentially, if we
are able to determine that the predecessor company had beneficial
unemployment tax rates, we may be in a position to either retroactively or
prospectively take advantage of those rates.  In addition, mid-year
transactions may also result in a refund of amounts paid by Enron in excess
of certain federal and state wage bases (Enron may be entitled to take
credit for those wages paid by the acquired company prior to, but during
the same calendar year, as the transaction).

We obtained Enron Corporate Data Sheets from Kate Cole and Deborah Korkmas
was designated as a legal contact related to several external acquisitions.
We have prepared a short, one page questionnaire, which will assist us in
determining whether a significant refund opportunity exists related to
these particular acquisitions.  According to the Corporate Date Sheets,
Deborah is the legal contact for the following acquisitions:

2000 - Garden State Paper Company, LLC (FEIN: 94-3371710)
2000 - KUCC Cleburne, LLC (FEIN: not listed)
2000 - Tenaska IV Partners, Ltd. (FEIN: not listed)
2000 - Harrier Power Corporation (FEIN: not listed)

Please complete the attached questionnaire for each acquisition with as
much information as possible.  If the acquisition did not involve
employees, just complete the top portion of the questionnaire and answer
questions 1 and 2.  In reference to question 5, since it is unlikely that
you have access to such detailed payroll information, if you could provide
the states in which the predecessor had employment, we will then be in a
position to contact state agencies to gather more detailed information.

Thank you for your assistance in this process.  If you have any questions,
please call me at (713) 237-5346 or Janice at x37839.  Once the
questionnaires have been completed, please return them to me via e-mail at
alexa.r.cutter@us.andersen.com.

Sincerely,

Alexa

Subject:	Employment/ERISA Rider for Stock Purchase Agreement

Michelle,  Attached is a rider we intend to insert into the stock
purchase agreement for the Brooklyn Navy Yard transaction.  I think
Angela Davis may have already talked to you about this transaction.  We
just found out yesterday that the company we are buying, which is a
subsidiary of Edison Mission Energy, has three or four employees.  We
and the seller had previously thought that they were employees of the
parent, not of the subsidiary that we are buying.  Please let me know if
you have any comments to these sections.  I will be in New York on
Monday working through the final changes to the agreement with David
Marks, Bill Keeney, Angela Davis and Stuart Zisman from Enron and the
seller and their counsel.  If you respond to this e-mail, I will pick it
up with my Blackberry, so that will probably be the best way to get in
touch with us.  Thanks, and sorry for the late notice.

Regards,

Subject:	RE: Enron Metals North America Voluntary Separation

Michelle,

I'm quite happy with the lay out of the plan (great flexibility), but have just a few comments/questions.

Article 2.3, Can we make such a broad statement that is so biased toward the Company?

Article 3.1, I think the max payment is 56 weeks.

Article 5.2, Under failure to meet performance, can we reduce the 45 day period and reference oral notification as well as written notification?  One of my concerns is, if we notify someone that we accept their Voluntary application, but need them to work for the next 3-4 months, the employees' motivation level might be very low which will effect their performance level.  Or perhaps we can build a statement in to the Separation and Release Agreement stating that the completion of their transition of their role needs to be satisfactorily completed to receive the separation pay.

Also, somewhat related, do we expect to have the involuntary severance plan amended anytime this year?  As I'm working out the next stage of involuntary severance reductions, just need to know if the calculation is likely to change.

Thanks Michelle.

As you may know, I recently moved into Cindy Olson's organization and am responsible for our corporate responsibility initiatives, including diversity.  Andrea Yowman now reports to me and will coordinate the diversity function.  

All of you are involved in diversity, whether it is because you have participated in the Corporate Culture Committee, are responsible for supplier diversity, recruiting, compliance, etc.  We think that an ongoing coordination effort among the people invited will be critical to the success of our efforts.

I propose that we arrange a standing, one-hour meeting, initially every two weeks, to discuss overall strategy as well as individual activities that we have been involved in.  I would like for the first meeting to be held in mid-November.

I hope we can count on your participation.  Please let me know if you will be able to participate, and if so, which day and time works best from the list below:

Tuesdays:		10:00 to 11:00 a.m. OR 1:00 to 2:00 p.m.
Wednesdays:	9:00 to 10:00 a.m. OR 3:00 to 4:00 p.m.

If it is not verified in advance and there is a problem (often the wiring and the ACH instructions are different), we risk the wire not going through.  Just let us know if you want us to send it to her ACH account.

We always use the info in SAP on checking accounts (per below).  Janie checks the info before wiring.

Michelle,

This check was dated 12/3 and was for $28,228.  It is my understanding that the bank will reject any check in excess of $15,000.   
 
If we replace this check, it will be rejected again since it is over $15,000.  Are we authorized to make these type of payments via a wire transfer, or would we still be in violation of the payroll order?  If we can not process it as a wire, can it be processed on the 12/31 semi-monthly paycheck?

Robin Treadwell deposited a check from Enron relating to the tax settlement statement prepared by Price and sent to Enron demonstrating that Enron owes me US$28,228.00.  Robin deposited the check from Enron into my bank account last Thursday evening, December 13th.  On Friday, I mailed via FedEx my tax return with a check in the amount of $32,127.00.  The IRS received the check and my return on Monday, December 17.  

Today I checked my account electronically and there was only $7,000 in the account.  I called Wells Fargo Bank because the amount did not balance with my records.  The Bank informed me that the Enron check is not credited in my account because the Enron check was not honored.  They don't show that the IRS has yet forwarded my tax check, but if it has not already been received and returned to the IRS IT WILL CERTAINLY HIT MY BANK TODAY.  Enron's bank notified my bank last night that the Enron check is being returned due to non-payment and that the maker of the check needs to be notified.  Enron's bank will not give further information as to the exact reason.

Please contact me immediately as to how Enron is planning to solve this problem.

Regards,

Vicky

Subject:	FW: Question on stock grants - legal clarification requested

Michelle, I've been seeking an accounting opinion from a FIN 44 perspective the impact on delaying vesting of options if someone goes on an unpaid leave of absense (like a sabbatical).  Besides below documentation, I've made the case verbally that we can point to the following to show that someone on leave is still an employee:
401k account distribution is not triggered
can continue in Enron medical benefits
Cash balance vesting continues i.e. service is bridged
employee can't compete or work for someone else, will sign waiver to that affect

Accountants will not answer my question unless I obtain legal opinion that employment status is maintained.  Can you give legal opinion?    If not, David, shall we incur expense of seeking outside opinion of counsel to get this question answered?

Subject:	RE: Question on stock grants - legal clarification requested


Tracy, currently someone is placed on inactive status when they go on unpaid leave of absence; they cease participation in all plans but can continue to have medical coverage if they choose to make the necessary 100% contributions; since they are on no pay status, no FICA or SUTA/FUTA is paid in; for headcount purposes they cease to be included in total headcount reporting.  So it is hard to say whether it qualifies under the below provisions.

For the sake of this opinion, however, if we wanted to pursue sabbaticals for a select few and could code them as ""active - sabbatical"" and thus show them up for headcount purposes, then what would the answer be?

Subject:	RE: Question on stock grants - legal clarification requested

Pam,

Just to make sure we are clear on our end, what you are saying is that the grantee would be considered an Enron employee under common law under the standards set forth in Question 1(b) in FIN 44 as follows:

 A grantee is an employee if the grantor exercises or has the right to exercise sufficient control over that individual to establish an employer-employee relationship. That relationship shall be determined based on common law as illustrated in case law and currently under U.S. Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 87-41. Accordingly, for purposes of applying Opinion 25, a grantee meets the definition of an employee if the grantor consistently represents that individual to be an employee under common law. The definition of an employee for payroll tax purposes under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code includes common law employees. Accordingly, a grantor that classifies a grantee potentially subject to U.S. payroll taxes as an employee under Opinion 25 must also (except as provided in paragraph 6) represent that individual as an employee for payroll tax purposes. A grantee does not meet the definition of an employee under Opinion 25 solely because the grantor represents that individual as an employee for some, but not all, purposes. For example, a requirement or decision to classify a grantee as an employee for U.S. payroll tax purposes does not, by itself, indicate that the grantee is an employee for purposes of Opinion 25 because the grantee must also be an employee of the grantor under common law.
We will base part of our conclusion on the answer we are provided. Thanks for the clarification in advance.

Subject:	RE: Question on stock grants - legal clarification requested

Tracy, someone on leave of absence without pay is changed to inactive status but is not terminated.  During this inactive phase, no payments generally would be made to the employee.  If any payment were made to the employee, he/she would be charged US FICA/Medicare, etc.  For example, an employee on inactive status could exercise vested options while on leave; this income would be reported as employee compensation and to the extent FICA limits had not been reached, would be FICA/Medicare taxed at time of payout.  Since they are not earning a salary, per se, during the leave, no FUTA/SUTA taxes are withheld.

What other additional information do I need to provide?  Would a screen print of someone who's on leave from our SAP system be helpful?

Pam, 

Stan Farmer and I have been working per your request on the compensation issue related to leaves of absence.  We need further legal clarification regarding one point before we can properly assess the situation you described in your previous e-mail.  

When you state, ""It is also assumed that employees on unpaid leaves maintain their ""active"" employment status,"" we need to know the manner in which you are defining an active employee.  For purposes of evaluation under FIN 44, the definition of an employee is a person under common law as illustrated under US Internal Revenue Ruling 87-41 potentially subject to US payroll taxes as an employee of the grantor of the options.  During the leave of absence, does the grantee continue to meet the definition of an employee under this statute? 

We need a legal opinion as to employee qualification under the Revenue Ruling above before we can further investigate proper accounting procedure.  As soon as we receive your response we will continue our research and provide you with the requested guidance in a timely manner.

Thanks for your assistance.

Michelle,
I received the below message, but still have questions:

If someone has been on leave for less than 12 weeks, but is currently out, what should we do in terms of selecting reviewers for them?  Should the supervisor select?  What should we do in terms of the self evaluation of listing 5 accomplishments that will be flashed on the screen during PRC meetings?  Should we just leave theirs blank?  If it is blank will it be viewed as a negative?  Can the supervisor contact the individual at home to ask them who they want for reviewers and what do they want to put for 5 accomplishments?  If the employee knows that we are going through this process and wants to select reviewers and do their accomplishments from home, should we allow that since they are on leave? 

Sorry to throw all of these questions at you, but the EES HR group has thrown them at me and I agreed to send you one e-mail to keep from all of us contacting you.  
Also, I need to get information from you on what to do in submitting my list of PRC attendees to you for review in terms of diversity.  It would be helpful if I understood what exactly you want and what you are looking for.

Any gudance you can provide on these matters would be appreciated.

Kriste/Michelle,
We are in the process of integrating 7 Enron Metals Far East Ltd employees from their former payroll to the Enron Japan payroll.  As part of this process, we are requiring them to sign the attached standard Confidentiality Agreement.  I'm getting a lot of pushback re: non-solicitation, and the fact that it governs all terminations (including involuntary).  Is there any possibility of amending?  Jane McBride and I have reviewed, and while we haven't yet sought advice on the matter, feel it would likely not be enforceable in Japan in case of involuntary termination without cause.  
Are we able to make the proposed change (redlined in purple in the attachment - I guess a lot of changes have been made to this document before either Jane or I were involved)?  As well, would it be an issue to insert something about jurisdiction?
If you could let me know as soon as possible, it would be most helpful.

Enron will own the content of the programs, and ultimately, licenses will be sold for the software, with Enron and Accenture sharing the royalty interest.

I think that your expertise is needed on this agreement.  I will send you a copy of the latest term letter, along with my handwritten comments on the draft.  

Would it be possible to get your comments/thoughts on these?  Yevgeny will contact you directly.

Thanks.

Michelle

"Cruise","FYI, I talked this morning with a guy who took the Mexico cruise the week of Thanksgiving last year.  He gave me some scoop on the trip.  The weather is nice, but wind causes things to be chilly.  Lots of good food.

One thing -- the cruise ship apparently can be quite rocky and rolly, which can cause some folks to have horrible nausea.  You may want to call your pediatrician to get some meds for the kids (and probably call your doc for some meds for you--as I recall, you got awfully seasick on the deep sea fishing boat, although it was when you were having all that trouble with your thyroid).

I hope that the sample agreements sent to John earlier were what you had in mind.

I have completed all of the amendment and assignment agreements for those persons with the guaranteed bonus.  I will hold on to them until you are ready to fill in the blanks.  A few of those employees work for Enron Canada Corp.  I am not sure if I can transfer them to the other company in light of tax issues.  Nonetheless, those are ready, and we can change the new company name if we set up a Canadian entity in the next few days.

"RE: ruling on affidavit language.","That is a close call.  Has he already called on the acquiring company?  If so, then I would think it would be ok.  If not, I don't think that he could contact his friends who used to be at Novarco simply because they were acquired.  That, to me, would violate the spirit of the affidavit language, particularly if Richardson still will do business with the acquiring company through Novarco.

We could revisit this once the dust has settled after the acquisition to see if that approach still is warranted.

Novarco (one of the companies identified on John Ashman's affidavit as a hands off account) is being aquired by a company that is not on the list.  There is some language in the affidavit (3c1) which appears to extend the list to the companies identified and their ""subsidiaries, affilitates, heirs, and assigns""; would a buyer be considered one of these?

Jeff Hodges has told me that you are helping us out with trying to locate information re: the Midwest Generation Labor Dispute.  The following article appeared in the Chicago Tribune today:

Under a settlement agreement signed with the National Labor Relations Board, Midwest Generation LLC, a wholesale power supplier to Commonwealth Edison Co., will begin negotiating as early as next week with the union representing 1,150 of its electrical workers, officials said. The move comes less than two weeks after the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local authorized a strike. The sides have disagreed over when the current contract expires; under a separate agreement, Midwest Generation was released from its obligation to maintain the existing contract through June 2002, company officials said.

Would there be any way to obtain details about this, or is it probably a confidential settlement?
Thanks for the advice.

Phil

Hi Rob,
 
I hope all is well with you and also that Enron is making full use of your experience and talent during this very difficult time.
 
I've been trying to get in touch with you by phone and as I realize you must be in all day meetings I thought I'd switch to email. In your message last time you asked me to get in touch with you this last Wednesday when you would have the outcome of Joe Dilg's review of the ECI contract and my employment contract (at least that's what I thought I understood but the message was breaking down).
 
As I have been postponing a deal I need to close for as long as I possibly can I really would appreciate it if you could provide me with the name of someone at Enron, in case you are swamped with other issues, with the authority to make the payments. As I mentioned before, the payments were due a few months ago and I'm now in real danger of not being able to close the deal at all if the payment is delayed further.
 
ESA is telling me I need to talk to Houston but I did not want to call Ken Lay's office at a time like this.
 
Please send me an email and also if you get some time please drop me a line to catch up on the personal side. I've been busy setting up my business in London and I think I should be ready to go with a couple of new ventures by the end of November. 
 
Best regards,
 
Diomedes.

As you may know, I recently moved into Cindy Olson's organization and am responsible for our corporate responsibility initiatives, including diversity.  Andrea Yowman now reports to me and will coordinate the diversity function.  

All of you are involved in diversity, whether it is because you have participated in the Corporate Culture Committee, are responsible for supplier diversity, recruiting, compliance, etc.  We think that an ongoing coordination effort among the people invited will be critical to the success of our efforts.

I propose that we arrange a standing, one-hour meeting, initially every two weeks, to discuss overall strategy as well as individual activities that we have been involved in.  I would like for the first meeting to be held in mid-November.

I hope we can count on your participation.  Please let me know if you will be able to participate, and if so, which day and time works best from the list below:

Tuesdays:		10:00 to 11:00 a.m. OR 1:00 to 2:00 p.m.

Dynegy has scheduled an all day due diligence session this Thursday beginning at 9 a.m. which obviously conflicts with the Bill Rome Mediation.  First thought: can we re-schedule? Second thought: the Dynegy meeting will be here at Enron - I can be in and out of the meeting but need to be here in the building.  In addition, how long will this take?  I would rather not re-schedule the mediation if at all possible but can't re-schedule the Dynegy meeting either.

Michelle

Following pushback from Britaldo Soares on the employment agreement we gave him, I had in country HR (Bottone is the VP of HR at Elektro) review our format and run it by his outside council. The attached is the result. Given we still have the same non compete and other principal terms I assume we can utilize it in place of the previous. 

Let me know if you have any problems with this.

Thanks

I'm sending for you the model of AMENDMENT TO THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT.

It was adapted according Brazil labor law requirements and it was revised by Veirano & Associados Advogados (Legal Counselor).

I believe that Corporate can analyse this model. If they agree with me, we will be implementing in future cases.

Nowadays we continue to use the Enron purpose form, although it contains clauses against our Brazilian
labor law.

If you have any doubts, call me.

Regards.

Michelle, attached is the agenda for the NEPCO  HR field training that
Mike Indivero has scheduled for his Team.  They have allotted
approximately 30 -  45 minutes to help us introduce ourselves to the
team.  Mike and I had briefly discussed using the time to explain the
subject matter expertise and services that OLER is prepared to provide.
You indicated that you would use the opportunity to go out to Seattle,
given that I had contemplated using vacation on August  1& 2.  I can
easily alter my vacation dates and attend if the trip fails to
compliment your work / travel schedule.   Mike Indivero has a widely
dispersed HR organization and they face many challenges unique to the
merit shop / construction world.  I'm sure they will enjoy the
opportunity to meet you.

Hi Randy;  thanks for helping Kelly with these consulting agreements.  Hopefully, attached above are the 2 emails that I think you'll need.  One is a note from Kelly with basic information on the 2 consultants and how he wants to approach the scope of work (for now, they are to be on a real tight leash, where, at our request, they will set up and attend mtings with folks in the environmental community, as we direct), and to let them propose their hourly rates.  The other email is the form that Michelle Cash says we should use for these ""political""/""quasi-political"" consultants.

Thanks again for your help.  Kelly is in SF the rest of this week (he's not traveling after all, for all the obvious reasons).

All the best,
Karen

"RE: Hi Michelle","Thanks for the thoughts.  We are getting through it.

Cameron actually wore his yellow rain slicker, his yellow rain shoes, and his red fireman's hat.  So, instead of rain boy, he was a fireman.  I must admit that he looked absolutely adorable!!

Your bash sounds like it was a lot of fun.  I wish I could get Trey to dress up, but he really isn't into that type of thing.  We went to the opera Sat. night -- Tanenhouser.  Wagner really is uptight, isn't he?  Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit -- escaped into the music.  I went to a gala last week for MD Anderson Cancer Center.  It was amazing.  Joan Lunden MC'd.  The Houston Symphony provided music.  Video from George W. Bush.  Speech by GHW Bush.  Entertainment by one of the Irish Tenors, Lyle Lovett, Dhianne Carroll (who had a costume change even though she sang only for 20 minutes!), a 300-person chior, all accompanied by the Houston Symphony.  It was quite the event.  Persons there included the former President Bush and Barbara, James Baker, Alan Simpson, lots of local celebs, and me and my brother  (one of these things is not like the other!).  Still, we had a great time.  So, not all gloom and doom around here.

Well, I'd better get back to it.

Subject:	Hi Michelle

Hope everything is going well, we've been watching the Enron stories in the
NY Times and thinking about you both. I have to admit that it makes me feel
better about  not understanding my 401K statements, the fact that analysts
could even get confused about financial reporting.

All is well here, we had a kick-ass Halloween party, Rich looked fantastic
as the Bride of Frankenstein (costume and make-up courtesy of me!), my
friend Kim took some great pics, I don't have copies yet but when I do I'll
send you one. Rich wore one of my bras and he put it and we put balloons in
it and I said, how's that?  Well, he said, it's tight and kinda itchs.
You're good then, that's how it feels - I told him. HA!

We joined SF carshare ( www.sfcarshare.org ) and used a car for the first
time this past weekend.  We used a little green new beetle to go hiking on
sunday morning. It was great. You pay per hour (2.50) and per mile .45.  I
don't think we will use it very often, the way our lives are we really don't
need a car very often, but it will come in handy once in while, and esp for
hiking during the winter - and we're hoping someone will need to picked up
at the airport or something.  And we really wanted to support SF CarShare to
make sure they survive.  They are non-profit.

Did Cameron wear his slicker for Halloween or did he get tired of it before
that?  Rich's step sister Liz wanted her son Bennet to be a cowboy and he
wanted to be a power ranger or something.  She got him the power ranger
costume and let him start wearing it a month before Halloween in the hope
that he would be sick of it by Halloween and consent to be a cowboy.  Not
sure what happened but it sounded like a good plan.....

Say hi to Trey and Cameron for me.

Love,
 cheryl

Q:  Will I be paid for any unused vacation? (we've already answered this broadly, but are getting a ton of specific questions around vacation now b/c they are thinking that it is being treated as an expense)
A:  The $4,500 payment included payment for all pre-petition compensation including unused vacation time, WARN notification, and incentive and overtime pay.

Here is my suggested response:
Enron's policy is to not comment on current litigation.  With respect to severance, if an Enron employee is let go prior to the merger, and is eligible for benefits under the Enron Corp. Severance Plan, then the terms of that plan will govern.  No changes to the severance plan have been made at this time.  In general, however, any severance waiver signed will include a release of claims for any and all conduct that has occurred to date.  Post merger, employees will be eligible for benefits under whatever severance plan the merged company adopts, including with respect to waiver requirements.

Michelle, here is a suggested revision to Section 3.4 B which I believe will accomplish the objective we discussed.  We need to draft procedures to be adopted by the Committee. 
B.  If a terminated employee who is entitled to receive a severance benefit under the Plan receives a notification of layoff from Enron in compliance with the Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, is placed on a period of paid leave of absence or furlough before termination of employment by Enron, and continues on the payroll of Enron for such period, the severance benefit payable under the Plan shall be reduced and offset, in a manner prescribed in procedures established by the Committee, by the amount of pay received by such employee during such period.

Dear Neil,
 
Sorry I was traveling on Friday when you called. I appreciate the call and spoke to Mark and he mentioned that you had also chatted as well.
 
Mark said that you would like to put a confidentiality agreement in place prior to our discussions.
 
I have attached the one we have used for a starting point. I do not really care which one we use, I thought this might help you out. Please feel free to modify and return to me and I will execute.
 
I look forward to our meeting.
 
Thanks,
 
Cabell

Michele - I have not yet gotten a hold of the 2 individuals I'd like to work with on this.  Mark H. had asked me not speak to them until after I'd met with Richard Sanders.  At any rate, I should be able to speak to them next week and get their names to you - I want to ensure that they want to work on the project.  I'll be in touch as soon as possible next week.

Mike,
 
I have attached a letter which was sent to Ming's home last evening.  The letter summarizes a meeting which was held between Ming, Cindy Olson and Valeria Hope on 10/16/01.  The letter outlines the options offered to Ming for separation which were crafted to be very sensitive to her immigration issues.  In the meeting, Cindy and Valeria shared with Ming that after an extensive investigation where Fundamentals employees were interviewed, there is no evidence of unfair treatment or discrimination.
 
I appreciate your willingness to respond to Ming, but would prefer that all future communication come from Michelle Cash.  We feel there may be pending legal activity and would like to ensure that our communications are privileged and consistent.
 
Also, Michelle Cash will be drafting a communication to all who were copied on Ming's message to you.  We would like to ensure everyone that Ming's situation is being treated with urgency.
 
 
Thanks,

Dear Mr. Lay, 

My employment with Enron is to be terminated, the reason given by HR, for not meeting performance standards.  However, I firmly believe that this is not the real reason, the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager (Mr. Lowell Bezanis,Manager, EGM) who, I believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me.  I have since filed a written complaint to Enron's EEO Committee. 

This committee, having investigated the case, has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings.  As a consequence, my reasonable request for a re-deployment package has been rejected.   

If my employment is to be prematurely terminated I not only lose my job, but also my residence status in the US where I have lived in the past 8 years.  The HR department is fully aware of my situation and I feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue Enron in exchange for protecting my status for 30 days.  I now feel that I am being pushed into a corner, unnecessarily, since all I have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife (not only towards myself but also to other employees, some of whom have left as a result) in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions. 

I have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of Enron where I have performed to the best of my ability, often receiving compliments from clients.  This cannot be the only way to solve this issue! 

 

The Trigger and Retaliation.    

Since Mr. Bezanis has been my line manager, internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me.  On August 28, I attended a class of 'natural gas structuring'. Mr. Bezanis called the Learning Center refusing to pay the associated costs, however, I was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge. 

I felt that this situation could not continue and so I made an appointment with Ms. Shanna Funkhouser (my HR representative).  The day previous to the aforementioned meeting I was summoned to appear before Ms.Funkhouser.  Mr. Bezanis and Mr. Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered.  Feeling intimidated, I requested that I meet with Ms. Funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the EEO, as agreed previously.  She refused and continued with what I can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of Enron property and equipment.  I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination. Ms. Funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following:  

-        the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work 

-        that I was making jobapplications by company email 

Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment. 

As a manager, Mr. Bezanis has: 

-        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals.  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval. 

-        Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance (PRC process) which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers' and clients' by review.  Until now, Iam still have not been informed of my PRC results. 

-        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an 'energy index' as a potential useful trading instrument.  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite, but the reaction of Mr. Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first.  I was banned by him from developing the idea further. 

Discrimination.  

It is our belief that Mr. Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees, especially competent women, as equals.  His rough, stifling, and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms. Courtney Campbell, the other only woman reporting to him.   

Hostile Working Environment. 

 

The working environment under Mr. Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one. Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common. Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence.  We are managed by ""threats"" rather than constructive comments.   

Wrongful Termination. 

Knowing I was unfairly treated, Enron HR has not helped address my concerns.  I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the mid-year PRC process.  Ms. Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair, but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases.  I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers, no matter how wrong they are.  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time.  

I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case. 

Yours sincerely, 

Mingcheng Lian

Subject:	2001 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PLAN

This year the Office of Labor & Employee Relations (OLER) is pleased to provide your business unit's 2001 Affirmative Action Program online.  The online site contains the documentation required to meet our regulatory obligations including the AAP narrative, goals and utilization analysis.  We have also included links to critical EEO/AA policies and related information.   We are excited about this opportunity to simplify your access to this critical and important information.   Please reference this web-site when you have an open position that needs to be filled or when considering transferring and promoting employees.   The URL link is listed at the bottom of this message.

Through our Affirmative Action Programs we take positive steps to ensure that we deliver on our commitment to EEO.  Affirmative Action is not about quotas for women or minorities nor is it about preferential treatment to less qualified candidates because of their race, gender, disability or veteran status.  Through affirmative action, we seek to establish a ""level playing field"" for all employees and applicants, regardless of race, gender, disability or veteran status.  We use statistical analyses of employment patterns as indicators of whether the playing field is truly level.

The AAP contains proprietary information, therefore it should not be shared with anyone outside of Enron.  If your operating company is participating in a bidding process where EEO/AAP information is requested, please forward those requests to the corporate Office of Labor & Employee Relations at EB1561 or call (713) 853-3086.  Please refer to Enron's Code of Ethics book for guidance concerning your obligations of confidence with proprietary company information.

Although the AAP contains proprietary information and belongs to Enron Corp., the narrative section is to be made available for review during regular work hours to all job applicants and employees who ask to see it.  We ask that these requests be forwarded through Human Resources and that the web site you are accessing not be shared.

We would also like to take this opportunity to reaffirm the strong commitment of Enron Corp. to the principle of Equal Employment Opportunity in its personnel policies and practices.  It is our Company policy to recruit, hire, train, and promote into all job levels, the most qualified employees and applicants for employment, without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability, or veteran status.  All employee selections are based on (1) inclusive recruitment and outreach efforts, and the merit, qualifications and competence of individuals for the particular positions, and (2) consistently providing equal employment opportunity.  We believe that a diverse workforce is a strength, and that as we implement personnel policies and practices which foster fair treatment on the basis of race, sex and disability, we promote equitable employment opportunities for all employees and applicants.

Enron administers all personnel programs and employment opportunities without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, pregnancy, national origin, physical or mental disability, veteran status, or status as an alien authorized to work in the United States.  Such employment programs and opportunities include, but are not limited to, compensation, benefits, transfers, layoff, leaves of absence, return from layoff, training, education, tuition assistance, and Company-sponsored social and recreational programs.

We have developed and implemented the 2001 Affirmative Action Program (AAP) to support our commitment to the principle of equal employment opportunity and meet federal and state requirements.  The AAP describes, in detail, the policies and procedures used in the Company's operations to carry out its commitment.

Your company's EEO Officer, as stipulated in your plan narrative, is responsible for administering the Company's Affirmative Action Program and will report to senior management on a continuing basis with regard to the progress being made under the AAP.  If you have questions, comments or concerns about Enron's Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action policies, please speak with your supervisor or your Human Resource Representative.

As with any rollout of a new web-site, errors, while not expected, may occur.  Please contact AA Program@enron.com if you are unable to log-in or experience any difficulties.  We would recommend that once you access the site you add it to your ""favorites"" list for future reference.

Michelle - does this make sense from an acquisition standpoint or should we transfer everyone to ENA ?

Amy can you pull in Anne, Sarah and Tana and check for all of newco/ENA employees as per the most current list. I'm completing the data room this am and info ready for a counterparty

There will be some ENA folks who are not on the newco list

Michelle,

I've been working with Pat on a separate Waiver of Benefits agreement for our employees on a dual payroll system with the UK/US (Oxley, Kitchen and Pickering).  Somehow the waiver was never put in place for David and Louise when they came over.  I discovered this when working on the package for Pickering.  

David has agreed to take the agreement to Louise and Mark, once he is comfortable.  We've gone back and forth with David a couple of times.  He now says he'll sign if we take out item 1 and the last sentence of 4. 

I think we need item 1, but I've adjusted it on the attached to try to meet our needs.  David's concern is that the current wording puts ""salt in the wounds"" regarding the benefits they are giving up, or may give up in the future.  He wants to keep it simple.  

Please review and let Pat and I know your thoughts.

Attached is the email between Robin Johnson and Melissa Becker I described to you.
 
Also, while at Nepco, I would suggest you have an introductory meeting with:
 
    John Gillis (President) 
    Dan Haas (SVP of Operations)   (#2 guy)
    Mike Indivero (Sr. Dir. - HR)

Mike:
 
I was somewhat disturbed by Robin's email below and unclear as to why Melissa Becker needed to know how NEPCO participated in the PRC process.  I would like to discuss this with you as soon as you return from your trip.  I realize NEPCO is a little different.  However, Robin and the rest of the NEPCO team need to understand that as long as they are part of Enron, they will, in some form or fashion, participate in the current performance management process.  Robin needs to discontinue using the term ""forced"" and begin using the term ""preferred"".  Also, please explain to Robin that in the overall EEOS PRC meeting held in Houston, in which both John Gillis and Dan Haas participated as voting committee members,  the Enron-wide preferred distribution process was adhered to.  I would like to clear up this confusion as soon as possible.  
 
Thanks,
 
Cindy

Hi Melissa: 

Sorry for the late response.  NEPCO did not participate in the preferred 
distribution for PRC.  The only group that I am aware of within NEPCO that 
was ""forced"" to recognize it was the HR department and we are still 
discussing the outcome of that exercise and forced ratings.  Let me know if 
you have any other questions! 

THANKS!

Hi Robin.  Hope all is going well in Bothell.  I have a quick question 
about PRC ( the performance review process we use in Houston).  Does 
NEPCO use the same process of 360 feedback, followed by assigning 
employee ratings based on a preferred distribution, followed by 
communication with the employee?  I heard that some parts of NEPCO use 
it and some don't.  Could you give me the ""lowdown?""  Thanks!

Hi Sharon,
 
Brad's manager is aware that we are exploring the possibility of a conflict.  Brad is currently in the Freight Markets group where he has developed pricing models for this new business. Brad's current manager does not foresee a conflict and I believe Brad developed these models in between being an associate and a full time hire.  Brad did not create the models as a part of his job responsibilities and although Brad says we are not currently in the business of trading long distance minutes, it is not far-fetched to think that we may at some point.
 
If you have further questions, I would be happy to arrange a brief meeting with Brad and his manager - this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.

Sharon, 

This is the write-up that Brad Romine prepared explaining his involvement with a communications company. 

Per our conversation last week, we are now trying to determine if this business involvement presents a conflict with Enron's Code of Conduct and if so, how to handle.  This situation arose when EGM offered Brad an employment agreement.   Brad reviewed the non-competition language and wondered how his involvement in this business would be handled.

Please advise as to next steps so that we may proceed with the employment agreement process. 

Thanks, 
Shanna

Shanna, 
        Per your request here is a brief description of my relationship with Bluewater Communications. 

        Bluewater is a provider of prepaid calling cards. They purchase minutes from wholesale telcom carriers on a take or pay basis and then resell them to retail customers. Bluewater is responsible for marketing the minutes to the retail customers, and all volume and price risk for the minutes.

        I developed for Bluewater a model that allows them to structure their prepaid calling cards to maximize profitability while minimizing volume risk. The model uses their historical calling profiles and allows them to compute the expected profitability of a given calling card platform. The model utilizes statistics as well optimization theory.

        My current  working relationship with Bluewater is a licensing aggrement which allows them to use my model on an ongoing basis. They pay me a percentage of their monthly revenues for use of the model. As they collect more data from their switch I am occasionally asked to recalibrate the model (about once every 2 months). 

        That is the extent of my envolvment with Bluewater. 

Brad

As you may know, I recently moved into Cindy Olson's organization and am responsible for our corporate responsibility initiatives, including diversity.  Andrea Yowman now reports to me and will coordinate the diversity function.  

All of you are involved in diversity, whether it is because you have participated in the Corporate Culture Committee, are responsible for supplier diversity, recruiting, compliance, etc.  We think that an ongoing coordination effort among the people invited will be critical to the success of our efforts.

I propose that we arrange a standing, one-hour meeting, initially every two weeks, to discuss overall strategy as well as individual activities that we have been involved in.  I would like for the first meeting to be held in mid-November.

I hope we can count on your participation.  Please let me know if you will be able to participate, and if so, which day and time works best from the list below:

Tuesdays:		10:00 to 11:00 a.m. OR 1:00 to 2:00 p.m.
Wednesdays:	9:00 to 10:00 a.m. OR 3:00 to 4:00 p.m.

Thanks for the quick response on this contract.  I made your suggested changes and deleted the paragraph about the confidentiality.   I spoke to the other Networks generalist who has night shift clients.  He stated that all night shift individuals receive the same premium and there's no reason to keep the matter confidential.  In fact, it is a selling point to attract night shift talent.  Thanks for commenting on the language.

Below is a quick summary of the general guidance provided by Mark Stubley during the conference call today.  If you have questions, please feel free to give me a call at 713-853-6401.

IBEW, Pipefitters, and others have tried to ""salt"" jobs down there in Florida.

The business agents will try to get out early and visit with the site manager to get a pre-hire agreement, if possible.  The business managers will take notes/keep diaries of their conversations with site managers and supervisors, so be aware of that possibility when you are approached by unions.  We should keep our own notes of conversations as they occur.

Should we designate one person to handle union relations?  We should have a very small group of people to have such a discussions, perhaps the HR site lead or the construction site manager would be the appropriate liaisons.  That way, we don't have the unions approaching our employees.  We have no obligation to have such conversations, but it is a good idea not to be antagonistic with them.   Better to be polite, let them know that we are mobilizing the project, but that we bid this work as a merit shop project and will not sign a pre-hire agreement.  We should not give them any information about our hiring process or plans.

We should tell them that we will be glad to consider their people at the time we are hiring, but that we are not taking applications at this time.  We should inform them about how to apply for positions at the site, which will be at an off-site Human Resources office.  We also are going to use the state employment offices for clerical personnel, but not for other types because we have not had much success in receiving qualified candidates.

There is a need for HR to look at the off-site office before the lease is signed.

Other issues surround gating at the facility.  How will it be gated?  Who will control entry and exits?  What about the other ways into the site?  How do we prevent persons from using an alternative entrance and then getting into our site to talk with our people?  Parking area will be on the other side of the plant.  There are roads between the parking gate and the building site.  Because of all these issues, we should look at a plat for the site and then look at the gating situation.

Back to Mark's suggestions:

Be careful of calls coming into the project.  Make sure that the receptionist or office manager knows what to say to callers.  Those calls should be directed to that site HR lead.  Also, should inform those people how to answer questions about hiring plans.  E.g., ""Are you hiring electricians out there?""  Those should be referred to HR's off site office.  Also, those people should know how to answer questions as to whether we hire union employees.  They should refer such questions to HR and not answer them.  We will have a script for the receptionist for such inquiries.

Be sure to follow the 30-day rule.  Also, follow our hiring practices consistently.

Ultimately, there will be training for others at the site after more employees are on site, perhaps the last week of October, on union avoidance and other issues.

One more follow up item is to make sure that our subcontracts have union harmony provisions.  Galen (Millie?) is going to send those to David Lund.

David Lund, Michelle Cash, and Mark Stubley will discuss the issue of which local counsel to get lined up in the event that we need someone locally.

"FW: Robin Treadwell's Call","Robin,

Diomedes was not eligible for severance because of outstanding expense reports -- approximately $400K.  I know that Mary was involved in this to great detail.

Once the expense report issue is clarified, then he would be eligible for regular severance.  Mary and Tim Callahan have been coordinating those issues.

Robin called because Christopoulos Diomedes (I didn't look up the spelling) has been calling John Novak, Pete Weidler, and Joe [Kischkill?] ""asking where the review of payment"" stands.  Diomedes believes ""he met the milestones.""   Robin was told that you and Mary Joyce were working on this.

Can you e-mail Robin Treadwell and give her an update?  Thanks.

Subject:	FW: AMEX card Agreement

Michelle,

I met with Cheryl Slone & Johnny Ross yesterday regarding our current In-effective termination process when it comes to American Express balances for terminated employees.  

After sitting down with both, I made my recommendations and I got their feedback as well.  It seems that the following outlined recommendations is what we both agreed upon and would like to implement immediately.  However, I would like your blessing on this before I actually send out the communication to my team and the EWS HR Community.  

I have attached our current termination process flow.  

Recommendations from yesterday's mtg. 

1) Begin requesting an American Express balance at the same time we send the request for the stock option summary.

2) Provide balance sheet in termination folder for generalist to conduct the Exit interview.

3) Reiterate to employee their signed corporate card agreement, Number 9, which you can see in the attachment below. 
	I understand that UPON MY TERMINATION I will have to pay any outstanding balance owed on the Corporate Card
	PRIOR to receiving my final check.  I hereby authorize Enron to withhold from my check or checks, any and all amounts
	outstanding.

4) Since the employe will be processing a final expense report and will be receiving a check from the expense report group, an automatic deduction from their final check for their balance should not be a great impact for them.

5) This will reduce the time and energy that HR Reps spend tracking ex-employees after the fact and confirming that they have paid Amex, after they have received their final Expense Report.

6) My team has the access to include Amex balance withholding as part of our SAP Termination action before payroll finalizes.

7) MOST IMPORTANTLY!!!  This reduces the liability that Enron has had to incur with Amex and will save our Company a tremendous amount of money.   

8) For those balances that are more than the actual final check amount, the HR Svc Connection will work with the generalist on a case by case basis.

Again, if you could please give me your approval or feedback asap, that would be great.

Thank you ma'am.

We at EPS share our grief and prayers with our  fellow Americans in the wake of the terrorist attacks.  We offer our  condolences to those of you who have lost loved ones, friends, or colleagues.  This tragedy has touched each of our lives  While focusing on  business-as-usual is difficult right now, we are moving quickly to  adapt to the needs of our clients. We are adding special segments to our HR  classes to address organizational response and workers' reactions to the crisis,  and we will continue to work to meet your special needs. We are committed  to providing a compassionate resource should you need  one.

What  NOW?

Employment  Practices Solutions, Senior Consultant, Minneapolis/St.  Paulkedmond@epexperts.com 
 (800)  727-2766
 
Soon, very soon, we will all need to  get ourselves and our companies back to business - whether we are ready or  not.  How can we do this in a way  that is respectful and helpful, but at the same time doesn't create issues that  do not exist?
First, understand that we  are all affected.  Not just those of  us who had family, friends, co-workers, or neighbors in New York, Washington, or  who were passengers on the airlines.   Our world has permanently changed.   This is not a dramatic overstatement.  It is simply the truth.  We cannot undo what happened yesterday  but we can influence how we deal with the change and how we can be stronger as a  result of the horrible attack on our country, our safety, and our sense of  security yesterday.
Let me simply make a  list.  I apologize if this is not  Pulitzer Prize material.  Timeliness  is the most important factor at the moment.  
Speak to the  organization.  Pull management  together first to discuss their responsibilities as managers and give them  guidance.  Acknowledge their dual  roles as managers in the organization and individuals with personal  feelings.  While it will take time  to absorb the full impact of what has happened, it will be necessary to get  back to the business at hand.  
Depending on the size  and configuration of the organization, talk to everyone as a group.  Either get them together in person, a  group e-mail, voicemail, teleconference - whatever means are available to  you.  At this point it is most  important to let people know that we are all stunned but that we are pulling  together.  It is not important to  have all the answers right now.   Communication will continue.  
Acknowledge that our  world is now different.  The sense  of safety and security we had before September 11th is gone.  We must each individually and  organizationally replace that with something different.  
Acknowledge that  individuals will respond and recover at different paces.  Some will want to get back to work as  quickly as possible to regain their sense of normalcy and control.  Others will have difficulty focusing  for a long time.  Most likely it  will be sporadic and not a constant inability to focus.  This is a very normal response to a  crisis.  
Depending on your  organization and the level of direct impact, you may choose to bring a  professional counselor or team of counselors on site for a day or longer.  They can conduct group processes and  individual counseling.  
Another possibility is  a chat room where employees can share their experiences, feelings, and have a  place to vent.  The question will  arise, how long should the chat room be operational.  For right now, don't set a time limit,  but review it in a couple of weeks or a month.  If participation is decreasing (which  I except that it will in a month), determine a date to close it down and make  an organizational announcement to that effect.  When closing it down, don't go dark  without notice.  Just let people  know that it is time to end that part of the recovery process.  
Allow people to talk  periodically during the day.  The  need for the amount of discussion will change over the next weeks.  In the next day or so probably little  work will get done.  But by the  end of the week and certainly next week, business will resume.  
Consider allowing employees additional  personal time off for memorial services, blood donations, or other  community-focused recovery events.  
Remind people to use  your Employee Assistance Program, company counselors, health benefits,  religious leaders, and other local counseling resources as available.  Have someone in the organization pull  together a resource list of local and organizational telephone numbers for  employees and their families.  
Talk about the impact  on your specific business and what effect if any it has on your company.  Maybe it affects your communications,  transportation, distribution, or some other aspect of your operations.  
If  members of your corporate family have been killed in these attacks, consider a  memorial service later this week or next for all employees to attend, whether  they personally knew the individual(s) or not.  
Assure them that  business will go on, subdued perhaps, different in some ways, but there will  be continuity.  
Recognize that people  will be angry, sad, scared and confused for some period of time.  The risk of discriminatory judgments  and remarks is increased.  If you  hear such remarks, challenge, gently if necessary, but help people understand  that it is a normal reaction to the attacks on our safety.  
Remind them to take  care of themselves and their families and friends.  It is important to keep talking to  each other and their children, even those very young children.  Here is a good article they can  use:  www.womencentral.msn.com/parenting/articles/tragedy.asp 

We do not know what will be happening in the next weeks or  months.  There may be additional  armed conflict.  We have entered a  time of uncertainty that will continue to affect the national psyche and our  individual lives.  As organizations  we are well advised to be prepared to address the effect it will have on our  employees.
You will need to address the corporate travel policy.  What will you do if an employee is  afraid to travel to New York for a business trip?  Consider making other meeting  arrangements, at least for the near term.
Longer term you will have questions about what to do with  employees who cannot seem to focus after a reasonable length of time.  And you will have questions about what  is a reasonable length of time and proper disciplinary actions if needed.  We will address those questions as they  arise, but for now they are beyond the scope of this communication.  Please feel free to email or call us if  you have specific questions.
Yesterday I was conducting  a Best  Practices seminar in Minneapolis as the terrorist attacks were  unfolding on the East Coast.  As we  did not know the magnitude of what was about to happen we decided to continue  with the work in front of us but to be cognizant of the events that were  occurring.  The day and the response  of the participants were instructive to what to expect at work.  Participants were engaged, but at some  level distracted.  We took a break  every hour or so for an update on events.   We talked about our personal feelings.  We changed our agenda to spend the last  half hour of the day planning about how we would lead our organizations through  this tragedy.  We discussed the role  of Human Resources and the Legal departments.  We wondered at the inconsistency of the  beautiful day, the sunshine and the green grass in the suburbs of Minneapolis  and the horror we were hearing on the news.  We encouraged people who had two hours  of drive time to leave a half hour early to be home with their families.  We all took calls and made calls during  the day to check on family and friends.
In other words, we took  care of ourselves, and we took care of others.  We also worked, and planned for the  future.  I urge you to do the  same.

8 Del. C. ? 145 (2001) 
? 145. Indemnification of officers, directors, employees and agents; insurance 


(a) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the person's conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the person's conduct was unlawful. 

(b) A corporation shall have power to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper. 

(c) To the extent that a present or former director or officer of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. 

(d) Any indemnification under subsections (a) and (b) of this section (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. Such determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or officer at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum, or (2) by a committee of such directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (3) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4) by the stockholders. 

(e) Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this section. Such expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by former directors and officers or other employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as the corporation deems appropriate. 

(f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other subsections of this section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. 

(g) A corporation shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such liability under this section. 

(h) For purposes of this section, references to ""the corporation"" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this section with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. 

(i) For purposes of this section, references to ""other enterprises"" shall include employee benefit plans; references to ""fines"" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and references to ""serving at the request of the corporation"" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner ""not opposed to the best interests of the corporation"" as referred to in this section. 

(j) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this section shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. 

(k) The Court of Chancery is hereby vested with exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all actions for advancement of expenses or indemnification brought under this section or under any bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise. The Court of Chancery may summarily determine a corporation's obligation to advance expenses (including attorneys' fees).

"Re: Employment Contracts","Hi, Felicia.

As I told Cindy, there is no easy way for me to determine which contracts I have done in the past are for corporate versus other business units.  I simply don't organize my documents that way.  Instead, I do a numeric list of documents, and the documents are identified by employee name, as opposed to business unit.  As of now, I have over 4500 documents on that list.  So, I can't easily pull out corporate agreements.

I can say that most of the corporate agreements I have done have been for RAC or Finance, so Sheila Walton probably has kept track of them somehow.  The others most likely were at VP or above level, so I think they have been captured by corporate comp.

I hope that gives you information, even if it doesn't provide exactly what you are looking for.

Let me know if you have questions.

Michelle

In my new roll in Compensation, I am trying to get comfortable that we have all the Employment Agreements up-to-date in the Corporate Compensation Database so that we can ensure that payments are made in a timely matter and contracts are looked at for renewal in the same timely manner.  What would help us tremendously is if we could get copies of all the contracts you produce for Corporate employees both VP and above and below VP so we can make sure they are entered into the Compensation Database.  Mary Joyce's group enters the VPs and above but Cindy Ward and I are responsible for making their payments under the contracts.  Because of this, I want to make sure we have copies and do not miss anyone.   As always, your help is very much appreciated!

Thanks!

Subject:	RE: Payments

Michelle,

Thanks for your response. I tried to call you but got to your voice mail
so I am sending you this email to clarify some questions I have.

Please confirm that when you mention the ""processing of the ECI
payments"" you refer to the actual wire transfers and not to the process
of confirming the amounts based on the ECI-Enron contracts - which I
hope is complete by now.

Also, when you refer to the ECI payments does that mean that the
Employment Agreement payment amounts are still under review? If that is
the case and in the interest of gaining time please proceed with the
payments of the ECI amounts which I take it are simpler to calculate
(they depend on a formula and not on net income calculations like the
Employment Agreement payments) and we can deal with the Employment
Agreement payments later. Obviously if you have performed all the
calculations for both payments I would prefer to receive the entire
amount.

I realize this is a hectic time at Enron but unfortunately these
payments are VERY late and as I described in my previous emails I have
been postponing closing an important transaction which has considerable
value to me for months now. Unless I receive at least the ECI related
payments immediately I will be obliged to unwind other investments which
may be done at a considerable cost to me.

Please let me know if you have all the necessary information for the
wire transfers available to you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Diomedes

Good day, Diomedes,

First, let me say that I am sorry about the delay in responding to your
earlier email.

I am writing to let you know that the processing of your ECI payments
has begun!  Because of the significant amount of activity here at Enron
over the past few days, it may take a few days to finalize the
processing.  However, if you have questions about timing, please feel
free to call me at  713-853-6401 or Pam Butler at 713-853-6161.

Feel free to give me a call if you would like to discuss this matter

I gave them a few ideas but indicated that I wanted to get your thoughts and requirements.   I would like to meet with you next week to review  your thoughts and expectations.

Mary -- I met with Michelle today to review the needs of her group's access.  As the appropriate way to address this, Michelle is requesting the HR_VIEW_BASIC_DATA_ORG-ENTERPRISE role, which includes salary, for only one person in her group.  The HR Risk Management Group does require this access in their roles.  However, Michelle is limiting the access to only one person in her group who will then provide the data to the requestor as needed.  
 
This is the first request that I would say that should be approved.  LaQuitta Washington, for whom the request is being made, had the access before and it was removed during the audit.
 
If you approve, please return to me and I'll send to Steve and David Oxley.

Hi Michelle, 
 
As we discussed in our meeting this morning I need to have enterprise-wide access in order to run my reports.  I run the Quarterly Utilization, EEO-1 and VETS100 reports for all business units.  I also need this access to run the reports for the Affirmative Action Plans and to be able to provide Personnel History reports for Valeria Hope when she needs them for terminated employees that have filed complaints.  90% of the reports I run are companywide.  We also get various requests from different business units to provide ad hoc reports.  I filled out and submitted a SAP Security Request Form on 7/12.  It was assigned ticket #513575 but I'm not sure when they will get around to it.  If you need any more information, please give me a call.

Christina:   Here's a synopsis of the replies I received from within the
firm so far:

  *  One Fortune 500 client told a Littler attorney that he had participated
in a 100-company conference call about the issue earlier this week. The
sense he got from the call was that almost every company was planning to pay
employees the difference between their normal wages and military base pay,
exclusive of allowances, for a certain period which varied among the
companies. Many were going to pay for 90 days; some, for 180 days, and a few
for a year. One of the companies that was opting for 180 days had previously
provided a pay differential for 4 weeks.

  *  Another attorney was advised by a major energy industry client that it
was paying the difference between the military pay and the employee's salary
for one year.

  *  One attorney has spoken to several firm clients over the past few days
about this, and almost all of them are going to exceed the legal
requirements by offering some form of continued compensation, but no
specifics as to duration.

  *  Another Littler lawyer was told by a large industrial client that it
would pay the difference between military pay and normal salary, and
continue benefit coverage, with no indication about maximum duration.

This would enable the individual to talk to the attorneys about their individual immigration status and concerns, after they leave Enron's employment.  I believe it would also show that we are concerned about them.

The approximate cost of this is $150 per hour.

Do you see any problems with this?

	Per my conversation with Britt on Friday, attached is a draft notice
of bankruptcy in the Event case.  I left it very bare, i.e., did not say
whether the bankruptcy stays the adversary proceeding, because we may not
want it ""stayed"" in light of Rodney Tow's intent to dismiss the proceeding
in favor of an agreed liquidating plan.
	Also, the U.S. trustee filed  a motion to dismiss or convert the
case since it has been inactive and no plan has been confirmed.  I was not
served with the motion, but Rodney told me about it and I have received his
response.  I would like to join with a short response on Enron's behalf, a
draft of which is attached.  The response is due tomorrow (Monday), so let
me know if you have any concerns about filing it.

Kriste - 

Could you clarify a payment classification question for me?  

Separation Agreement payments are being entered into SAP for future payments.  These payments are in lieu of severance payments.  When these payments get coded into SAP, should they legally be coded as:

	1. severance payments (since they are taking the place of severance) or 
	2. agreement payments (since it is an actual agreement)

Call me if you have any questions.  I just want to make sure that we are coding them properly.  

Thank you.

Michelle,

	I spoke with Rick Brown, he told me that when he signed the
handwritten agreement on behalf of Elliott and Dickinson, it was his
understanding that CRDC would make the required payments under the
settlement agreement.  But, if CRDC defaulted then Chris Cline, Tim Elliott,
John Dickinson, and Enron could be responsible for the remaining payments.
He believes that if CRDC defaults and the other defendants do not agree
among themselves as to the amount and manner in which Clonch will be paid,
then Clonch will be required to institute one arbitration action against
each of the remaining defendants.  Additionally, he believes that under the
agreement the parties did not agree to joint and several liability.  I asked
him as to why he allowed his clients to be potentially personally liable on
the payments owing to Clonch by CRDC.  He explained that it was a ""no
brainer.""  He reasoned that Elliott, Cline, and Dickinson are the chief
officers of CRDC and they will do everything in their power to prevent CRDC
from defaulting, because they do not want to be subject to personal
liability.  Rick also told me that Kevin also agrees with this
interpretation.

	After speaking with Rick Brown, I spoke to Rich Walters, who
informed me that Clonch refused to accept Enron's offer to guarantee
payments under the settlement agreement beginning 2002 until 2007 at a
maximum of $1000 a month and $12,000 a year.
Rich Walters told me Karen Miller's interpretation of the handwritten
settlement agreement.  Her interpretation is in accord with Rick Brown's
interpretation.  For these reasons, only intends to sue Enron and not Cline,
Elliott, and Dickinson for violation of the settlement agreement.



	Please call me so that we may discuss. Thanks.

"RE: Recovery of H-1B Visa Fees","I guess that I would look at this a bit differently.  We are not penalizing a person for the cost of obtaining a visa; rather, it is the fact that he did not come through on his accepted offer and start to work for us that is the issue.  Does that matter?

Subject:	Recovery of H-1B Visa Fees

Margaret Daffin and I had a conference call with Alice Gruber regarding recovery of our expenses related to obtaining H-1B visas for new employees.  Margaret estimates there have been three/possibly four instances where an individual has walked away from a position after we had committed time and money to process the visa application.  According to Alice, the DOL regulations changed last year. 

The regulations do not allow an employer to penalize a foreign national for the employer's cost of obtaining the visa.  The regs do allow the employer to recover ""bonafide liquidated damages"" in the amounts ""stipulated by the parties at the beginning of the contract.""  The ""liquidated damages"" may vary from state to state.  Since our offer letter does not put these candidates on notice of our intent to recover such costs, there has been no stipulation by the parties.  If we put them on notice, then the most we could attempt to recover would be our attorneys fees, not the filing fees.  

However, Alice does not recommend that we attempt to recover our costs.  She thinks the legal fees for trying to recover these monies would outweigh the H-1B costs ($3,000.00 on average).

Also, Alice expressed concern that if we add some type of ""notice"" language to the offer letter, that we will force some candidates to accept jobs with other companies that don't threaten to recover these costs.  She believes this could have a ""chilling"" effect and cause us to lose quality candidates.  

I asked if we could put some kind of notice in the packet that Margaret Daffin sends out to the Candidates explaining what information she needs to process their visa applications.  We can do that, but that may drive some candidates away.

Alice thinks the unstable economy will reduce the number of candidates who walk away after the visa has been processed.  s. Apparently this was a fairly common practice in the last couple of years when the economy was stronger and the candidates were more cavalier about turning down positions.   

Let me know what you think.  Alice would like to be very involved if we decide to try to collect these monies.

Per -

I did not hear back from Shanna or Sharon Butcher. Could you please ask Shanna to take this situation to Sharon tomorrow?

John, Per and I discussed the hostile environment issue and we are both concerned that we may have some repercussions. I am vacation until the 22nd but Per is up to speed and I would like to make sure that you keep up with him and any HR / Legal activity that may occur. 

Thank you

Micelle,
Can you please let me know what the status of the contract template for Japan is?  I understand you are working on this with Baker & McKenzie for Jane McBride.  I would be intersted in seeing the advice from B&M on this matter, because it would be helpful for me as the HR person in Tokyo.   As well, once the contract template is complete, if you could send it to me and Melissa Laing for our reference, that would be great.
Thank you for your help.

Great news about the tix.  We easily can have Cam sit on our laps, so no need to get any great seats -- if we can buy bleacher tickets to get him in the door, that works for us.

         Got your message on the voicemail at home but haven't been home in

      I've

      I

         Hannah and Erik and the two boys are great, the kids are cute - so

   does
      her

Michelle,

Joe has caved in on the home leave issue.  We only need to add the following to Exhibit A at the end of the Repatriation and Related items section:

""The items described above must be used within the six-month non-competition period; after that time, they will be forfeited.  If household goods are to be shipped to Argentina, Employee will have until May 15, 2002 to provide for duty free importation of goods into Argentina.  Additional time will be allowed where Enron must provide documents for duty free import of goods into Argentina.""

Change Furniture Storage from reimbursed to Provided.

Once we resolve 7.9 and 7.10 below, he'll sign.

Michelle,

Discussed the latest draft separation agreement with Joe today.  He has just a couple more questions.

1.	Article 7.9 was adjusted to add the first sentence, which references articles of the employment agreement.  He wants to know the intent of this addition.  Also, article 4.4 is referenced and there is no 4.4 in the employment agreement.

2.	Article 7.10 - He is still concerned about the situation where Enron is acquired by a company where he was employed.  I explained to him that such a situation would not fall under ""rehire"" by Enron.  However, he would like the last sentence to read, ""This provision would not apply if Employee is employed by an entity that may be acquired by or acquires a Company after the effective date of this agreement.""

These are all the items for you.  I'm still haggling with him over home leave and timing on shipment of goods.  Let me know your thoughts on the above and I think I can get him to agree to some terms that we can finalize.

Sorry I was traveling on Friday when you called. I appreciate the call and spoke to Mark and he mentioned that you had also chatted as well.
 
Mark said that you would like to put a confidentiality agreement in place prior to our discussions.
 
I have attached the one we have used for a starting point. I do not really care which one we use, I thought this might help you out. Please feel free to modify and return to me and I will execute.
 
I look forward to our meeting.

Sheila,

We have been advising Houston this week that the Comp Database is not a reliable source of information for our Executive Agreements - we use SAP as our source information system.

However, please note that we do not have separate legal employing entities in the UK, for example EBS or EGM employees will always be hired on an Enron Europe Ltd. contract.  Therefore, all of our contracts should and do say Enron Europe Ltd. or if someone is employed in a regional office the employee will be employed under the legal entity for that office.  Given this, I am not sure whether the below will still be relevant - perhaps if you could let me know the objective here we will know which direction to go.

As it is late in the day / week here, we will pull our own report on Monday and double check on this then.  

Thanks and Regards
Michele

We have been asked by  Legal to audit all employment agreements to determine if the Business Unit named in the Employment Agreement is actually the BU the employee currently works for.  If the employee is now working for a different BU, the agreement will then be assigned to the appropriate BU.  The attached is a list of EEL agreements we pulled from  the Comp Database.  Can you review these agreements and note any which should be assigned to another BU.  Please add any we do not have on this list.

London/Houston Legal will need to coordinate on any assignments for those that have non-US based agreements.

They have asked for this info early next week.  Sorry for the short notice - we just got the request today.

Please call me or Kari Oquinn if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help.

Subject:	Heads Up


Last night Sheila Walton asked if I would be interested in being the Generalist for Corporate HR (just an extra assignment along with my other responsibilities).  I told her I would be interested but would need to talk with you about it and of course she would need to discuss it with David.

The reason I'm interested is because it would allow me to keep up with what is happening in the Generalist world.  When I was the HR Rep for HR North America, I mostly dealt with Employee Relations type issues for the HR group.  Although those type problems with HR occur infrequently it requires someone who could handle information confidentially and with sensitivity.  Sheila feels that someone from our group would also lend a certain amount of neutrality since our group is somewhat separate from the other Corporate functions.  Also it is right in line with my primary responsibility now, dealing with Employee Relations issues.  Sheila said she would provide all the administrative support needed and there is staffing to deal with hiring.  

I expect that the added duties would take less than 5% of my time.  Although I already have my hands full now with the OLER duties I think I could make it work even if it means extending my work day or doing more week-end work.  I recognize the big undertaking that we have going with the Employee Relations and would not compromise the quality of work that would be needed to be successful.

What do you think?  Do you think we could make this work?

Valeria

My recommendation would be to let everyone know it has been restated and attach an electronic copy of the new plan, thus letting the plan speak for itself.  We then could arm HR with a list of FAQs to address the changes without publishing anything other than the plan to the population as a whole.  What do you think?

Also, Kriste, we will have to determine the audience for severance plan communication, as not all Enron entities have this plan (e.g., NEPCO).  Same thing with vacation.

Michelle -

Just got off the phone with Jeanie and wanted to see what we needed to do regarding folks who had original contracts under co code 0413 and have now transferred to co code 1596 (this company code is called Wholesale EES).

The following people transferred to 1596 effective 10/16.

Rogers Herndon
Narsimha Misra
Berney Aucoin
Edith Cross
Oliver Jones

Timothy Coffing has been in 1596 since 8/6/01 - previous was in 0985 (EES).

Gordon Savage has been in 1596 since 8/1/01 - previous was in 0985 (EES).

Dale Furrow was hired into 1596 on 9/24/01.

Let me know if you thing that we need to do something for these folks - I think the concern is whether or not they can argue that their non-compete time started at the point they left ENA.

Thanks!
Amy

We need a list of all benefit plans of any ""to be"" Newco employee.  We also rep that we have made these available to the purchaser.  I believe you said that the actual documents were available somewhere, so I assume that the other side could see them?

As soon as we receive notice to move ahead, generalists will receive a training binder outlining the process of the WARN notifications.  I assume we need to mark these documents as confidential and proprietary.  Is there any specific wording you would like on either a introduction page or as a footer on each page?

Carol,

I have a straight up deal with a consultant to work for me full time at $7500/month plus approved expenses.  His scope of work is identical to Eric Raab's plus add ""focus on developing the OTC market and wholesale carrier relationships that result in increasing the number of transactions and volume of traffic, particularly with buyers"".  He will also focus on building direct routes, our VOIP strategy and other trading oriented transactions.

He will report to me.  It is month to month, 15 days notice to terminate contract.

I'd like someone to prepare a draft of this so I can review and then forward it to Mr. Omar Valdez for his review.   

Thank you.

Cathy:  please see the following response from Alice Gruber:

IMMIGRATION MATTERS

Q: I've been working for Enron under a US work permit.  How will my
immigration status be affected when my employment ceases?


A:  Your work permit is specific to Enron and is not transferable to
any other employer without additional processing by the INS.  A
non-immigrant (H-1B, L-1, TN, etc.) is out of status once s/he has been
terminated.  Once the non-immigrant is out of status, in theory, s/he should
depart the US as soon as possible.  If the non-immigrant can find a new
employer and file within approximately 30 to 60 days from the date of
termination, the INS has generally overlooked the violation of the
maintenance of status.  Keep in mind this is not a hard and fast rule, and
the INS has the ability to enforce shorter or longer periods on a
case-by-case basis.

If you are offered another job in the US your prospective employer
will have to apply for a new work permit on your behalf.
If you do not get another job in the US and you wish to remain here
then you must seek permission to stay on other grounds.

Upon termination, the foreign national should contact an attorney and
schedule a time for a full consultation (in-person whenever possible)
regarding all issues.  There are often many issues which need to be
addressed as each person's immigration issues are unique.


I hope this is what you are looking for.  Let me know if we need anything else?
Thanks
Margaret

Does the new PRC Rankings Policy of only the top 10% and the bottom 10% will be reviewed by the Enron Office of the Chairman mean that only the top 10% of employees will be considered for promotions? Will the bottom 10% be asked to leave the company, if yes, then will we stick to it at all levels, especially Sr. Dir, VP & MD?

I think we are planning to hire all the mill workers listed on the schedule attached to the agreement.  We will be agreeing to some of the requests in their agreement, but not most of the substantive ones, such as their request that we trade out value for unvested GP stock options for Enron stock options, their demand that we maintain bonus programs that are similar, etc.  George's view is that we will control how we handle the employees, not GP.

Subject:	Posting and the ADA

My name is Jim Little.  I am a forth year Enron employee and a third year student at South Texas College of Law.

I am writing in response to a posting with your group for a Sr. Legal Specialist.  The posting itself contains no information about the job other than the fact that it is in the Labor and Employment Department.  I realize the expectation may be that I contact the recruiter directly; however, I felt efficiency would be served in contacting you directly.  I would appreciate any information you may provide including both duties and necessary qualifications.  

I would also appreciate you considering speaking with me in the near future concerning a paper I am writing about individuals with HIV and the protections they are afforded under the ADA.  I feel comfortable that Enron has addressed this issue and I am merely guessing that you would have been involved in such discussion or have familiarity through your various writings on the ADA.  I am still researching the topic, so it will be a few weeks before I would feel able to ask intelligent questions.  But I would appreciate knowing at this time if this is something you are able and willing to discuss.  

Thank you for your time,

Jim Little

Subject:	ENA v. Miller


Dear  Michelle:
 
    I  just finished my conference call with Liz Miller (counsel for Calpine),  Christina Solomon, and Steve Schuler (Steve is co-counsel for Miller with  Christina).  Christina had passed along to Liz the various points I made at  the meeting last week, so Liz was prepared to address our primary  concerns.  She made the following points:
         
         (1)    She has talked with several different people at various  levels of authority in Calpine's trading area, and insists that Calpine treats  the power grids as ""completely different"" regions, strategies for which are not  shared internally among those regions.    
 
         (2)    She asserts that ""how we do it at Calpine is totally  different from Enron,"" since Calpine is ""trading around a portfolio of assets  that we own.""  She asserted that Enron, not owning power generation assets,  trades differently.  When I replied that Enron does have power generation  assets, she acknowledged the fact but insisted that Enron's trading style is  vastly different due to the difference in emphasis vis a vis the power  generation assets.
 
         (3)    Liz claims that Miller works almost exclusively in  ""Urcot"" (sp??) in Texas, with some participation in Entergy in Louisiana.   According to Liz, Calpine's strategies concerning these specific regions is  divorced from and not related in any way with any trading Calpine does in the  East or West.  
 
         (4)    Liz is of the opinion that Miller ""is not senior enough  that we would be looking for what he knows.""  He has no role whatsoever in  discussing or formulating strategy for trading.  Miller, she insists, is on  the receiving end only.  He takes orders, dispatching and scheduling  solely in response to orders he receives from others.
 
         (5)    Liz acknowledges that, were Miller in a more senior,  responsible position, she would have the same concerns we are expressing were  the tables turned.  Miller is ""so slotted,"" however, that she believes that  he is not in a position to use any Enron trade secret that he might possess  (though she and Miller's attorneys expressed doubt that he could retain any  critical information, that the most critical information changes on a day-to-day  basis).
 
       We  ended the conversation with the following  understandings:
 
        (1)    Liz  will explore whether Calpine could put Miller in a non-trading function for a  period of two months or so.  
 
                 --She hastened to add, however, that trading is the only area for which  they really have any use for Miller.  She then suggested that she could  explore putting him instead in the West (""I know Enron doesn't even have a  western desk here."").  I believe that any proposal she comes back  with will entail his continuing in some trading  function.
 
        (2)    Liz  will try to determine how Calpine might provide assurances (acceptable to  ENA) that Miller is ""on the receiving end only,"" as she asserts, such that we  would be confident that he is indeed not in a position to use any trade  secrets he may remember.
   
                 --On this point, I was clear that I did not know either what level of assurance  ENA would require or whether this would even be a feasible  alternative.
     
         (3)    I am to explore with ENA whether this additional  information about Calpine's difference in trading strategy and the limitations  on Miller's duties alleviates ENA's concerns about protection of its trade  secrets.
 
                 --Liz seems to believe that if the business people really knew the information  she is giving to me, they would not be concerned about the activities of this  low level person.
 
     Liz has asked that we reconnect later this week to exchange answers to  these inquiries.  I look forward to discussing with you our  response.
 
     Thanks for your assistance.
 
Best  regards,
Linda  Broocks

On checking an old file for Mr. Krishnarao, I see that you started his Green Card application, based on Outstanding Researcher, in November, 1995.  There are also copies of the I-765 in the file, which I assume means that Mr. Krishnarao is already in the Adjustment of Status stage of the process?

I would appreciate you letting myself and Michelle Cash know where we are with the application at this time?  Hopefully, we are very close to completion!

I like that there is some sort of formal process based on peer group.  
 
I also like that they have made a decision to have ranking in the commercial groups.  It looks like they are being ranked to measure performance, not for compensation.  If so, then it would be nice for there to be some rough correlation to compensation.  If not, then what are the criteria for determining the bonus amounts?  If it is P&L and some other components, then let's specify what they are.  My biggest concern with all of this flexibility is that decisions will appear arbitrary with no clear basis for distinguishing between persons at the top of the bonus range and persons in the bottom.
 
On non-commercial, will there be a further breakdown within the 80?  If so, will those correlate to bonus amounts?  If not, same question as above.
 
I understand that market forces may drive many of these bonus decisions.  If so, then I believe that we simply should articulate them and be prepared to explain the bases for bonus payment amounts.
 
Promotion process looks good.
 
Assistants and clerks looks good, although it looks like OOC will decide bonus amounts.  If this is a fixed amount based on the rating, then that is ok.  Otherwise, if they are not pretty standardized, the same issues arise as above.  I
 
I expect that the same kinds of questions will arise for all business unit plans.
 
Hope this helps.  Let me know if you want to discuss or would like to talk through pay criteria.

Here is our plan on PRC. 

Assistants: 

Ranked 1,2,3 by supervisors - pay determined by Me and Louise.  No meetings. 

Non Commercial but in North America: 

Traditional ranking with the correct people addending the meetings.  Pay grid determined by OOC. 

Analysts and Associates 

Ranked as per Billy Lemmons %'s and then pay grid determined by OOC 
I would like to see 25% - 65% - 10%.  Billy disagrees.  This would provide for a quick meeting rather than trying to split them into 4 groups with the top one excluding some awesome people.

Managers/Directors 

Ranked from 1 to 100 in as many clusters as the groups see fit.  We are going to combine managers and directors into one table.  The ranking is based on this years performance is directly related to pay.  We will have two meetingss - one for traders and one for other commercial staff (orig/finance/etc).  We will not have a pay prc but will take the results of the rankings and work with individual leaders after the meetings to ensure the appropriate compensation.

We will also determine promotions during this meeting using different criteria. 

VP's 

We will rank all our VP's from 1 to 100 with a group of selected people - some VP's and some MD's.  
This too will be directly related to pay. 

Cheers as you Brits say

Hi Michelle,

I received the employment agreements for Jeff Kinneman for execution by the company.  John Sherriff has signed them and as such I am returning them to you.  However, please confirm that  John Sherriff is permitted to sign on behalf of Enron North America Corp.

As Jeff is a US employee working in Houston with only a dotted line to Europe, I presume that the compensation team in Houston will be loading the executive agreement onto the relevant compensation system, and ensuring that the contract is passed to the relevant person for requesting the options etc. ( I know that it used to be Mary McKendree, so I am copying Pam on this message).

Regards

Melissa

Here is my suggested response:
Enron's policy is to not comment on current litigation.  With respect to severance, if an Enron employee is let go prior to the merger, and is eligible for benefits under the Enron Corp. Severance Plan, then the terms of that plan will govern.  No changes to the severance plan have been made at this time.  In general, however, any severance waiver signed will include a release of claims for any and all conduct that has occurred to date.  Post merger, employees will be eligible for benefits under whatever severance plan the merged company adopts, including with respect to waiver requirements.

Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will that affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?

Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver as part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareholder class action suite against Enron.

Michelle,

The Coal group has a question related to personnel they would acquire from Vulcan if they purchased the marketing rights to their coal.    In this scenario, there are 4 marketing employees which would come to Enron as a part of the deal.   A few things:

In this case, I'm assuming these employees would resign from Vulcan and Enron would extend the appropriate offer.
Secondly, Enron's purchase of the marketing rights will be for an 18mo to 3 year trial period. At the end of the trial period, if Enron returns the marketing rights to Vulcan (or current owner), they want the right to re-call these employees.  George McClellan is ok with the right to recall, but I am not sure how/where to put this in writing ie; in the deal agreement, offer letter, etc.

Thanks,
Shanna

Michelle, since the Plan is not administered centrally, it can be a challenge to learn what past practices were, especially if they differed from different work groups.  I've have always recommended centralized administration because an ERISA plan is required to be administered uniformly and consistently in similar circumstances.   
One place to check about past practices is Cynthia Barrow's group.  You may not know what all past practices were until the conclusion of discovery related to litigation.   
I don't know what past practices were, but I would start with Cynthia's group which I view as the source and reference point as to what the recommended practices should be.

Michelle,

In our effort to develop a better program for Enron and transform HR in to commercial viable operation, we would like to enter in the relationship with Accenture that will help us to achieve such goals.  Attached below is a document that summarizes our intent.  Please review it and lets get together to discuss the language.  Some of the key points were we the originating arm are struggling is Warranty section.  I assume that between you and Accenture's counterpart you will be able to work out the version that is acceptable to Enron and the provider.

Accenture will provide the name of the attorney involved in this initiative.

Subject:	RE: A few questions about the scripts

Mary, based on the most current information:  
1.	A&B employees will receive bonus consideration however the amount is not dependant or determined by their A / B designation.   Accordingly, any mention of bonus in the scripts will need to rely on what we have said in the past, I.E. Bonus will be dependant on financial performance and employee contributions over the past year.  
As result of this interpitation, Bonus, albeit a element of retention, should not be included as an inducement to retention at this time.  (source - Aaron Brown) 
2.	The employees on the D - list are being placed on paid furlough and being terminated at a known date in the future.  That period of earning calculated to be a severance plan offset.   Employees who work up to their specific term date ( C-list) will be receiving their normal pay; then their severance pay, without a severance plan offset.  Michelle Cash is working with Pat Mackin to define the severance plan features that will govern this timing and the corresponding explanations.

Hi Rob,
 
I hope all is well with you and also that Enron is making full use of your experience and talent during this very difficult time.
 
I've been trying to get in touch with you by phone and as I realize you must be in all day meetings I thought I'd switch to email. In your message last time you asked me to get in touch with you this last Wednesday when you would have the outcome of Joe Dilg's review of the ECI contract and my employment contract (at least that's what I thought I understood but the message was breaking down).
 
As I have been postponing a deal I need to close for as long as I possibly can I really would appreciate it if you could provide me with the name of someone at Enron, in case you are swamped with other issues, with the authority to make the payments. As I mentioned before, the payments were due a few months ago and I'm now in real danger of not being able to close the deal at all if the payment is delayed further.
 
ESA is telling me I need to talk to Houston but I did not want to call Ken Lay's office at a time like this.
 
Please send me an email and also if you get some time please drop me a line to catch up on the personal side. I've been busy setting up my business in London and I think I should be ready to go with a couple of new ventures by the end of November. 
 
Best regards,

Bridgeline is a JV between Enron and Texaco.  Currently, Enron and Texaco have been assigning employees to work for Bridgeline, with no change in employment status.

I have been trying to get a legal question answered and Jeanie Slone suggested I run the question by you.  Will the Bridgeline ""employees"" be considered terminated from Enron/Texaco OR will they fall under the Same Desk Rule?  I had assumed that this is a legal question...to be decided by the legal department.  Is that a correct assumption?  Any insight you have would be much appreciated!

As you know this is not a simply question.  On the surface this sounds like a 'transfer' from one participating Enron employer to a non-participating Enron employer which would mean that the impacted employees are actually terminating one payroll company and being hired by another.  However, you all need to feret out the exact details and make sure if we know if there is any divestiture issues.  In addition to the 401(k) we need to make sure we know how the other benefits will be handled.

Please coordinate a call between yourself, Pat Mackin and Sarah to get the specifics before guidance is provided.

I don't think you need to have a separate payroll deduction document at termination, but it probably would be good to provide them with a copy of the one they previously signed.

My thought was that it may make sense to remind all Amex card holders of the policy so that there are no surprises at termination.

Thank you ma'am for your quick response. 

I can work with Cheryl Slone, Johnny Ross & Ryan regarding the communication to all current Amex users. As for the communication to the HR Community, I can get that out today to make this new implementation to our Termination process effective 10/01/01.  

Now, my only additional question now is, the employee has already signed the Amex Agreement as I specified below, do you see a need for me to include an additional document in the Termination packet for the employee to acknowledge as well for that Payroll deduction. I was planning on it since they have already signed the Amex agreement, but, if you think we (The HR Svc Connection) should, please let me know and I will prepare something and run it by you.

Please advise.

Michelle,

I met with Cheryl Slone & Johnny Ross yesterday regarding our current In-effective termination process when it comes to American Express balances for terminated employees.  

After sitting down with both, I made my recommendations and I got their feedback as well.  It seems that the following outlined recommendations is what we both agreed upon and would like to implement immediately.  However, I would like your blessing on this before I actually send out the communication to my team and the EWS HR Community.  

I have attached our current termination process flow.  

Recommendations from yesterday's mtg. 

1) Begin requesting an American Express balance at the same time we send the request for the stock option summary.

2) Provide balance sheet in termination folder for generalist to conduct the Exit interview.

3) Reiterate to employee their signed corporate card agreement, Number 9, which you can see in the attachment below. 
	I understand that UPON MY TERMINATION I will have to pay any outstanding balance owed on the Corporate Card
	PRIOR to receiving my final check.  I hereby authorize Enron to withhold from my check or checks, any and all amounts
	outstanding.

4) Since the employe will be processing a final expense report and will be receiving a check from the expense report group, an automatic deduction from their final check for their balance should not be a great impact for them.

5) This will reduce the time and energy that HR Reps spend tracking ex-employees after the fact and confirming that they have paid Amex, after they have received their final Expense Report.

6) My team has the access to include Amex balance withholding as part of our SAP Termination action before payroll finalizes.

7) MOST IMPORTANTLY!!!  This reduces the liability that Enron has had to incur with Amex and will save our Company a tremendous amount of money.   

8) For those balances that are more than the actual final check amount, the HR Svc Connection will work with the generalist on a case by case basis.

Again, if you could please give me your approval or feedback asap, that would be great.

Thank you ma'am.

This email confirms our discussion that one of the mandates of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of Enron is that they approve all formations of and grants related to any subsidiary equity or phantom equity plans.

Mary and I can and will work closely and quickly with any group needing to get this done.  Mary is responsible for presenting the plan for approval to the Compensation Committee after Tax, Legal, Accounting, Commercial and HR interests are scrubbed.

These types of plans have accounting, legal and tax complexities that need to be worked out and change regularly.  Also, it is very important that no written or verbal promise related to equity grants before Compensation Committee approval is obtained.

Kriste/Michelle,
We are in the process of integrating 7 Enron Metals Far East Ltd employees from their former payroll to the Enron Japan payroll.  As part of this process, we are requiring them to sign the attached standard Confidentiality Agreement.  I'm getting a lot of pushback re: non-solicitation, and the fact that it governs all terminations (including involuntary).  Is there any possibility of amending?  Jane McBride and I have reviewed, and while we haven't yet sought advice on the matter, feel it would likely not be enforceable in Japan in case of involuntary termination without cause.  
Are we able to make the proposed change (redlined in purple in the attachment - I guess a lot of changes have been made to this document before either Jane or I were involved)?  As well, would it be an issue to insert something about jurisdiction?
If you could let me know as soon as possible, it would be most helpful.

Chor Lim has been working with me on my draft Employment Agreement (which is quite different from the Singapore Employment Agreement I have seen). Chor Lim forwarded amendments for Houston's consideration yesterday (see Chor Lim's e-mail below), but she was re-sent the original draft overnight (without comment on the amendments) advising that you will be speaking to me about it in our call tomorrow. I'm not sure if you have seen the amendments, so I requested Chor Lim for a copy for your reference.

Looking forward to speaking with you tomorrow.

Sheila:  I understand Tammy is on vacation.  We need  someone to review the database that Tammy Joyner maintains and determine if the Business Unit named in the Employment Agreement is actually the Business Unit the employee is currently working for. If the employee is now working for a different Business Unit, then we will need to make sure the Agreement gets assigned to the appropriate Business Unit. 

So, we need a list of the employees whose Agreements to be assigned.

Please let me know who can get started on this project. 

By copy of this e-mail, we are asking Fran Mayes, Jeanie Slone, Shanna Funkhouser and Kim Melodick to let us know of any Agreements that need to be assigned.  We need to do this clean-up as soon as possible.

To the extent that any federal, state or local law, including, without limitation, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) and any other so-called ""plant closing"" laws, requires [company] to give advance notice or make a payment of any kind to an Eligible Employee because of that Employee's involuntary termination due to a layoff, reduction in force, plant or facility closing, sale of business, change of control, or any other similar event or reason, the benefits provided under this Plan shall be reduced by the amount of such payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, an Employee's Severance Benefits shall not be less than the amount required by WARN, and in the case of an Enhanced Severance Benefit, shall not be less than the amount required by WARN plus an additional amount to be determined by the Employer. 
Hope this is helpful.  Let me know if there is any big news at Enron.  Things appear to be moving fast.

Les,

Attached please find a draft Consulting Services Agreement for Gary Gentry.  I'll need some input from you on Exhibit A, as well as the rate to use in the compensation section (Section 2.01).  Otherwise, this document should be in a form that will facilitate quick negotiation/execution with Gary.  I'm still waiting on a response from EE&CC Legal (John Schwartzenburg) re getting a release from some of the continuing obligations that Gary has under his previous CSA with them.  I suggest that we obtain any such release in a separate document in order not to slow our progress on this document.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments at your convenience. 

Kind regards,
Dan

Jeff Hodges has told me that you are helping us out with trying to locate information re: the Midwest Generation Labor Dispute.  The following article appeared in the Chicago Tribune today:

Under a settlement agreement signed with the National Labor Relations Board, Midwest Generation LLC, a wholesale power supplier to Commonwealth Edison Co., will begin negotiating as early as next week with the union representing 1,150 of its electrical workers, officials said. The move comes less than two weeks after the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local authorized a strike. The sides have disagreed over when the current contract expires; under a separate agreement, Midwest Generation was released from its obligation to maintain the existing contract through June 2002, company officials said.

Would there be any way to obtain details about this, or is it probably a confidential settlement?
Thanks for the advice.

Phil

Michelle:

Here are two good responses regarding the issue about which you called me
this morning.

I researched this issue under federal criminal law and did not find any duty
to report. You should know, though, that the penalties are pretty draconian.
Tell your client not to print anything, forward anything, etc. Just delete
it all.

Per the recent news stories re the arrest of individuals who have downloaded
child porn, the possession of same is itself unlawful, so the client should
systematically dispossess itself of it.  Brian

I received no comments to the contrary regarding these.  Thus, it appears
that you can delete the material and go forward.  I will do a little more
checking and get back to you with any supplements.  We have not checked the
law of PR, do you want me to do that?

Subject:	HR Warehouse 

Hello everyone!
The purpose of this e-mail is to tell you about a new program which we are rolling out that will benefit the ENTIRE ENRON HR COMMUNITY.
It is called the HR Warehouse.
It is a collection of folders located on the O Drive  which have been set up to increase communication between the various BUs' HR groups.
The idea was born out of our experiences in the HR Forum, where various members of the Enron HR community would share ideas, goings on, etc.
The primary goal is to increase efficiency.  Why re-create the wheel when it is already on the road elsewhere?
We all have a variety of programs, processes, forms, etc. which we use in our daily work life.
Through this repository, you can now share your ideas with others, and put their ideas to work for you.
Also, there is a parking lot for HR related questions, where you will be able to get answers/ advice for whatever problems/ issues you are dealing with.
The document below is the framework for this program.
The only way this will be effective, however, is for people to use it!
I am in the process of setting up security access for these folders, and need your assistance.
Can you please e-mail me a list of EE's who you feel would benefit from the HR Warehouse (actually, everyone could, but we need to restrict access!).
Also, if you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know. 
Thank you!

Sunjay

Subject:	FW: Child Pornography issue

Michelle:

I wanted to follow up with some additional information regarding the child
porn issue.

The consensus seems to be that the company does not need to report the child
porn if it does not want to.  The only exception to this is individuals
engaged in an electronic communication service or a remote computing service
to the public are obligated under 42 U.S.C. 13032 to report child porn to
the Cyber Tip Line at the National Center for Missing and Exploited
Children.  I looked at the definitions of ""electronic communication service""
and ""remote computing service"" and the second does not seem to apply
although the former could apply.  The statute appears to qualify both as
providing those services ""to the public"" so I would not think an email
system for employees would apply.  The definition of electronic
communication service is pretty broad though.  If you want me to investigate
this further let, me know, but I would think we have a good argument that we
do not provide these services to the public.

The child porn statute, 18 U.S.C. 2252A, covers pornography involving girls
under the age of 18, so much porn could be child porn.  There are enhanced
penalties for certain types of child porn and for child porn involving
children under the age of 12.  There is an affirmative defense under the
statute if the possessor of child porn destroys it or reports it to a law
enforcement agency.  Therefore, it seems the best course of action is to
destroy anything the company has and there does not appear to be a reporting
obligation.  Ashley anonymously called the FBI and the DA and their
responses are indicated below.  The information obtained from the FBI and
DA's office is consistent with my recommendations.

"Employment contracts","Good morning.

David has asked me to summarize a request for data relating to employment agreements, as the company needs to decide whether it will reject or accept those agreements in the bankrupt entities.  We also need to decide how to handle agreements in non-bankrupt entities.  We will need summaries of all employment agreements in the entire company, broken down by business unit, group, name of employee, term/duration of agreement, and future obligations under the agreement.

We will need those segregated as follows:

Employees involuntarily terminated in the last 2 weeks.
Employees involved in Newco/Trading operations.
EEL employees
Employees remaining in the Enron estate.

Could you arrange for this work to be done (preferably by tomorrow)?  I would suggest that someone develop a single format that works for this data and then share it with the others.

Thanks!!

John,
I have been approached by HR with the following request which I would like your input.
When an employee is being terminated HR is giving them an agreement instead of severance pay.  The question is can it be taxed by the W-4 or does it have to be taxed as supplemental pay. 
My understanding is if an employee receives payments from an employer that are not part of their ordinary wages, it is considered supplemental wages and if the payment has been clearly indicated as other than ordinary wages it is taxed at the flat 28% (which will soon be 27.5%).
I would appreciate your input as to whether we could set up an agreement element in the system and tax it at the W-4 rate and not have any tax issues down the road that Enron could be held accountable, and what regulation could we use for support.
Thanks
Janice

Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will that affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?

Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver as part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareholder class action suite against Enron.

Subject:	REVISED DRAFT - Savings Plan Memo


Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will now be allowed, regardless of your age, from ALL company contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://hewitt.resources.com/enron  or through benefits.enron.com.

Spoke with Tindall & Foster this morning with regard visa questions we can ask on our app form.   They have given us an additonal question as below (2) which would be helpful in terms of planning/budgeting etc for new hires.

Can we add to electronic form and see if we can add to hardcopy (subject to volumes already printed).


1)	Are you legally authorized to work in the United States? 
2)	Will you now or in the future require sponsorship for employment visa status (e.g., H-1B visa status)? 

Margaret - can we look to arrange for the lawyers to come in again and present to HR and give us updates on immigration policy.

Here is teh e-mail I told you about...


	EBS Office of the Chairman Sent by: EBS Announcements 07/12/01 11:10 AM 	   To: EBS Worldwide  cc:   Subject: Changes at EBS	



To:		All EBS Employees Worldwide

From:		EBS Office of the Chairman

Subject:	Changes at EBS

Date:		July 12, 2001

Since its inception, EBS has seen dramatic changes in the communications industry.  The growth and opportunity anticipated in this industry two years ago has significantly changed in the past nine months.  While Enron remains committed to extending our business model into telecom, we need to quickly respond to these changes in the market to achieve our objectives.

The Enron Corp. earnings release issued today states that we will be adjusting the EBS business to better match the revenue opportunities.  This means that we must reduce our overall cost structure and better focus our commercial efforts.

To achieve this, we will take the following steps:

EBS will become a business unit within Enron Wholesale Services.  This will involve the integration of all EBS commercial support functions into those units within EWS, and will enable us to better manage the resources and costs of the support functions.

All EBS commercial functions will be consolidated into the following units:

Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele
We will consolidate the North American EBS origination teams into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  
North American trading and risk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also oversee the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the Chairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to most effectively meet the future needs of EBS.

The Portland office will be closed by October 1.  Portland employees will be advised by their supervisors of their relocation or redeployment status by July 27.

These changes will affect many EBS employees through relocation, redeployment, severance or movement to another part of Enron.  We have not yet worked out all of the details of these changes, but your supervisor will apprise you of how this affects you as soon as possible, and no later than July 27.

Cathy,

The voluntary separation calculator asks for a number for 2 weeks pay.  Should that be four weeks, or does the program take the 2 weeks and multiply it to arrive at the four weeks base pay number?  If the latter, I can see it creating some confusion.  If the calculation sheet needs to be set up that way, perhaps we should drop a note explaining.

Michelle, I don't know if I have the final restated plan document.  I'm not sure what changes anyone made after my last draft.  I don't even know what the design decision  was regarding the formula.  I think that Kriste has it or Mary Joyce should have it. 
The best way to incorporate the revised paragraph into the plan would be to cut and paste the revised paragraph over the existing paragraph B.

Dear Neil,
 
Sorry I was traveling on Friday when you called. I appreciate the call and spoke to Mark and he mentioned that you had also chatted as well.
 
Mark said that you would like to put a confidentiality agreement in place prior to our discussions.
 
I have attached the one we have used for a starting point. I do not really care which one we use, I thought this might help you out. Please feel free to modify and return to me and I will execute.
 
I look forward to our meeting.
 
Thanks,

I don't think the plan would call for an employee to withdraw from litigation to be eligible for benefits--just that the employee sign the waiver.  Then, I think that in the employee's lawsuit we'd argue that the waiver released the claims and that the claims should be dismissed.

Rick or Cole,

PR received the following question.  We'd like to have an answer prepared, but don't plan to post it or include it in any of the Q&A that will accompany scripts.  (You may want to include it in an HR Q&A or post to LiveLink.)

Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will that affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?

Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver as part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareholder class action suite against Enron.

Kim/Michelle -

Chuck will be contacting you on the non-solicitation language.  I asked him to coordinate directly as I am in meetings all day and would just hold up the process. 

Chuck started out y-day indicating that he just could not live with the language and then this am I told him that If he couldn't live with the language I would ask whether or not we could offer them the 1/2 Restructuring package.  when he realized that he may be stuck with a package that would yield 1/2 the $$$ he changed his tune.  Now he is saying that all he needs is assurance that our intent is not to keep him out of work at a competitor.  In fact, he said he REALLY wanted to sign this today.  

I think all we need to do is explain our intent with the non-solicitation language.  I do not feel we should change the language for him but would like to see us come to an agreement.

This is weird, but he signed today and said he would coordinate with Kim Melodick to get in touch with you for you to explain the intent of Section 5.5.  He indicated that he had a 7 day out provision in case he did not get comfortable.  When I indicated that I could explore the possibility of offering an agreement without the language but at 1/2 the pay-out I think he got scared.  I think he must have another opportunity in the wings that he does not want to miss.

Tim, I just wanted to share with you the matter of my having received a telephone call a week ago from Pam Benson (formerly of Joe Sutton's office).  She was the admin with Joe Sutton's office who'd approached me and then insisted I had to come work with her in supporting Joe's office even after I had told HR and her I wasn't interested.

She was also responsible for eliminating me from Joe's office in his absence upon her return from her surgery after I had supported his office  having been complimented by him verbally to Pam in my presence as having taken what he referred to  as ""the best planned trip he'd been on in years with everything in place"". (This was in reference to his trip around the world when he went to India to meet with President Clinton.)

Pam said she's ""had me on her mind for a long time"" then proceeded with:
""I was going to call you at home but was uncertain that the number I had was correct, so decided to call you at Enron since I knew you were there."" 
""I had to call to tell you I've had you on my mind for a long time and that I need to tell you how very sorry I am for what I did to you, Cindy.  You didn't deserve to be treated like that.""  ""You are a fine person"" and then she broke down crying on the telephone.  Pam said she hoped in her heart I would forgive her and that ""she didn't deserve to talk to me"".  

She said she had retired and was calling me from her home and that ""God had been talking to her and told her to make this telephone call and that she needed to call to apologize to me for what she had done to me."" She said twice, ""if there is anything I can do for you emotionally or financially, please call me and I will do whatever I can to help you.""  My only response to Pam was, ""Pam,  I  do not understood why you did it.""   

Tim, in all of my years employed within the corporate environment, I have never encountered anyone like Pam Benson before who would harbor jealousy to the point where they would want to destroy a person's reputation among their peers and professional associates and manipulate someone's career.  Of course she caught me off guard calling me here at the office around 11:00 am which left me speechless.  I found her call strange as so much time has passed.  Her disruptive behavior only reflected her thoughts. 

I just thought I'd share this with you.  Some people never cease to amaze me.  

Cindy

This check was dated 12/3 and was for $28,228.  It is my understanding that the bank will reject any check in excess of $15,000.   
 
If we replace this check, it will be rejected again since it is over $15,000.  Are we authorized to make these type of payments via a wire transfer, or would we still be in violation of the payroll order?  If we can not process it as a wire, can it be processed on the 12/31 semi-monthly paycheck?

Subject:	Income Tax Settlement Reimbursement Check from Enron

Robin Treadwell deposited a check from Enron relating to the tax settlement statement prepared by Price and sent to Enron demonstrating that Enron owes me US$28,228.00.  Robin deposited the check from Enron into my bank account last Thursday evening, December 13th.  On Friday, I mailed via FedEx my tax return with a check in the amount of $32,127.00.  The IRS received the check and my return on Monday, December 17.  

Today I checked my account electronically and there was only $7,000 in the account.  I called Wells Fargo Bank because the amount did not balance with my records.  The Bank informed me that the Enron check is not credited in my account because the Enron check was not honored.  They don't show that the IRS has yet forwarded my tax check, but if it has not already been received and returned to the IRS IT WILL CERTAINLY HIT MY BANK TODAY.  Enron's bank notified my bank last night that the Enron check is being returned due to non-payment and that the maker of the check needs to be notified.  Enron's bank will not give further information as to the exact reason.

Please contact me immediately as to how Enron is planning to solve this problem.

Regards,

Vicky

"RE: Bill Rome-- PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL","This will just be Rome and Enron.  Although we believe that most of his claims really are against HMS, his lawyer is claiming that Enron used HMS to defraud Rome.  His lawsuit will be against only Enron.  Therefore, it makes no sense to drag HMS into this at this point (although they probably will have to be involved in some fashion after suit is filed).

I have spoken with Kevin on this.  Rome's attorney has asked for a mediation with Gary McGowan, who is an outstanding mediator.  We have agreed.  My paralegal, Diane Goode, will be calling you to schedule the mediation time as well as time for a preparation meeting.  I am in the process of preparing a chronology of events for you and Kevin, since he said that you should be the one involved in such a mediation.

If, prior to that, you would like to engage Rome in settlement discussions directly, feel free to do so.  I doubt that he will want to talk about it without his lawyer.

He still is an employee, but his deadline for redeployment is 10/31, at which time his employment will be terminated.  We will continue to honor his contract and pay him through the end of the Term, although he will not remain an employee of Enron.

Let me know if you have any questions.

We have achieved and surpassed  the  goals  defined in  our strategy and most important we have left EcoElectrica with  in a good position to handle itself  in presence of a union, which is not  an easy thing to achieve, we have also established the  grounds  for a solid open relationship without compromising any managerial principle or economic objective.

Hello, Michelle!
 
You came and spoke to my new hire class last Monday. I have a pending book deal with Zondervan publishing and wanted to make sure that there was no problem re the confidentiality agreement. 
 
I am certain there will be no problem. I have been a minister for 22 years and have a proposal being pitched by the senior editor at Zondervan to their editorial review board. The book will draw on my leadership/team-building experiences in the church and will be written from the perspective of a minister / mba. It will have nothing to do with Enron.
 
Please let me know when would be a good time to come by.
 
All The Best,
Bill

Subject:	RE: Payments

Michelle,

Thanks for your response. I tried to call you but got to your voice mail
so I am sending you this email to clarify some questions I have.

Please confirm that when you mention the ""processing of the ECI
payments"" you refer to the actual wire transfers and not to the process
of confirming the amounts based on the ECI-Enron contracts - which I
hope is complete by now.

Also, when you refer to the ECI payments does that mean that the
Employment Agreement payment amounts are still under review? If that is
the case and in the interest of gaining time please proceed with the
payments of the ECI amounts which I take it are simpler to calculate
(they depend on a formula and not on net income calculations like the
Employment Agreement payments) and we can deal with the Employment
Agreement payments later. Obviously if you have performed all the
calculations for both payments I would prefer to receive the entire
amount.

I realize this is a hectic time at Enron but unfortunately these
payments are VERY late and as I described in my previous emails I have
been postponing closing an important transaction which has considerable
value to me for months now. Unless I receive at least the ECI related
payments immediately I will be obliged to unwind other investments which
may be done at a considerable cost to me.

Please let me know if you have all the necessary information for the
wire transfers available to you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Diomedes

I am writing to let you know that the processing of your ECI payments
has begun!  Because of the significant amount of activity here at Enron
over the past few days, it may take a few days to finalize the

Mark, a few issues have risen in the Accenture Arrangement Letter I'm
working on with Yevgeny.

Background.  Accenture is going to create video and other content for a
training module for Enron.   Part of the deal is that Enron is suppose to
license the training module to Accenture for Accenture's internal training.
The issues are this:

1.  Accenture has now asked for a warranty and indemnity regarding ownership
of the content by Enron.  What, if any, warranty or indemnity will Enron
give regarding the content.  (Initially, I drafted that Enron will not give
any warranties or indemnities, but Accenture is now asking for them.)

2.  Due to the content, Enron employees and Enron names and logos will be
displayed.  Accenture wants to display the content to its employees and in
another agreement display the content to third parties.  Whose approval does
Yevgeny need to allow such use of the content?

Please advise on Enron's position.

Ryan,

I'm sending back down the mark ups to the rif packet you sent to me.  On the waiver, I've scratched out some paragraphs and told you I would send other language.  This is it.  Call with questions.



4.	Employee Benefits.  Except as otherwise provided in Section ___((the paragraph with the dollar amount)), Employee shall be entitled to receive vested or accrued benefits due and payable to Employee under all employee benefit plans and compensation plans, subject to the terms of those plans. 

5.3.	Cooperation.  Employee agrees that, at Company's request, he or she will devote reasonable time necessary to assist in Company's litigation matters, including, but not limited to, meeting with counsel, providing testimony at depositions or trial, and related activities.

To the release paragraph (right after the bolded paragraph saying employee releases everything.... add this section (you may need to organize the sections):

b.	This release does not apply to or include the consideration or benefits described in Section 2 above or to other promises and representations contained in this Agreement.  This release also does not apply to claims which may arise after the date this release is signed. Employee understands that he or she may challenge the knowing and voluntary nature of this release under the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA) and the ADEA before a court, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), or any state or local agency charged with the enforcement of any discrimination laws, despite the release language stated above. Employee also understands that nothing in this release prevents him or her from filing a charge or complaint with or from participating in an investigation or proceeding conducted by the EEOC or any state or local agency charged with the enforcement of any discrimination laws.  Employee understands, however, that if he or she pursues a claim against Company under the OWBPA and/or the ADEA, Company may seek to set off the amount paid to Employee for signing this release against any award he or she may obtain in such legal proceeding, and Company may be entitled to recover costs and attorney's fees incurred by the Company as specifically authorized under applicable federal or state law.

Also add this:

d.	Employee acknowledges, agrees, and represents to Company that:

(i)	Employee has carefully read and fully understands the effect of the provisions of this Agreement, which he or she is entering knowingly and voluntarily;

(ii)	Employee has had a reasonable time of not less than 45 days in which to consider this Agreement;

(iii)	Employee was advised and encouraged to consult an attorney prior to executing this Agreement with respect to the effect of the provisions of this paragraph and Employee's execution of this Agreement; and

(iv)	Employee acknowledges that he or she has received information concerning the age and job titles of other persons in his or her job classification or organizational unit, if any, who are remaining employed with the Company, as well as the job titles and ages of the persons being offered payments upon voluntary separation.  The voluntary separation applies to the groups, for the time periods, and based on the eligibility factors set forth in the attached Exhibit ""A.""

	Employee may revoke this Agreement during the seven-day period following the date Employee signs this Agreement by delivering signed, written notice of such revocation to Human Resources and as required under Section __, whereupon this Agreement shall be rescinded in its entirety and become null and void.  


Add this as well: 

7.10	Mediation.  If a dispute arises out of or related to Employee's employment with Company, or this Agreement, and if the dispute cannot be settled through direct discussions, then Company and Employee agree to try to settle the dispute in an amicable manner by confidential mediation before having recourse to any other proceeding or forum.


Please send it to me again, and I will help organize as needed and check to see if we need to add any other major provisions.

"Michael Lindert v. Enron Corp. and EES","Vicki,

As mentioned in my voice mail on Friday, we have received a lawsuit filed by Michael Lindert against Enron Corp., EESO, and EES, Inc., in which he basically claims that he is due unpaid commissions.  He seeks damages of $1 million.

Jim Derrick passed this lawsuit to me, but let me know if you want me to manage it on behalf of EES.  

I have contacted Chicago counsel (for information, not retention, purposes) to determine the answer date, which is 30 days.  I do not believe that we have been properly served, however, so we appear to have additional time.  The suit was filed 11/1, and we received it sometime last week, via cover letter to Ken Lay from Lindert (rather bizzarre, if you ask me). 

The law firm representing the plaintiff is not some hack plaintiff's firm; it actually is a blue chip family law firm with a good reputation in Cook County.

The case probably should be removed to federal court due to diversity of citizenship.  According to the Seyfarth, Shaw lawyers I contacted on Friday, the Circuit Court of Cook County, Law Division is not a place where we would want to be, and federal court is preferable.  We have 30 days to remove to federal court.

Let me know how you want me to proceed.

My name is Jim Little.  I am a forth year Enron employee and a third year student at South Texas College of Law.

I am writing in response to a posting with your group for a Sr. Legal Specialist.  The posting itself contains no information about the job other than the fact that it is in the Labor and Employment Department.  I realize the expectation may be that I contact the recruiter directly; however, I felt efficiency would be served in contacting you directly.  I would appreciate any information you may provide including both duties and necessary qualifications.  

I would also appreciate you considering speaking with me in the near future concerning a paper I am writing about individuals with HIV and the protections they are afforded under the ADA.  I feel comfortable that Enron has addressed this issue and I am merely guessing that you would have been involved in such discussion or have familiarity through your various writings on the ADA.  I am still researching the topic, so it will be a few weeks before I would feel able to ask intelligent questions.  But I would appreciate knowing at this time if this is something you are able and willing to discuss.  

Thank you for your time,

"RE: ENRON/Clonch release","This looks fine -- have we released us from any and all obligations that may have arisen before the date the agreement is signed?  I don't want there to be any other surprises, so I'd like to include ""known and unknown"" type language here.  Also, does the definition of ECT include all parents, shareholders, affiliates, employees, attorneys, etc?  Let's be very clear.  I'd also like a covenant not to sue signed by both Clonch and his attorneys.

"RE: Question from Amy Fitzpatrick","No risk to non-compete.  The payment obligation is one that is independent of non-compete.  MHC

Subject:	Question from Amy Fitzpatrick

Holly Krebbs left Enron (Portland). She had a 3-month evergreen and was supposed to be paid her salary through that 90-day period.  Due to a computer glitch, Holly got terminated from payroll and did not receive a regular paycheck from August 8 through September 26.  As soon as Holly made Amy aware of the situation (Sept. 26), Irma got the computer records corrected and requested a check to pay monies due. The employee was sent a check via Federal Express.

Amy is concerned that we may have somehow ""breached"" the settlement agreement which would allow Holly to ignore her obligations re non-compete.  Is the non-compete still in effect as long as she got the money, even if it wasn't paid on time? 

We know Holly is going to AEP at the end of the 90-day evergreen and Amy has already had to remind her of her non-compete obligations because Holly was seen lunching with an AEP executive.

Is there a risk here re non-compete?

Thanks....

Point well taken.  I softened the language up after sending out the e-mail, but can probably go further.  As to protection of intellectual property, the employees still have that obligation correct? Our concern is that we spent $17MM for the IP, and we now have a former employee brazenly declaring that he can use our IP to start his own business.

Although all employees did sign the non-compete, I believe (without doing any research on Florida law) that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce since there is no ongoing business of AMPS to protect.  As such, I believe that such a statement is kind of like rubbing salt into the wounds of these employees.  
 
A gentle reminder of confidentiality would be appropriate, but any mention of a non-compete probably would not be well received.

I would like to include the following paragraph in the termination letter to AMPS employees: 
Please advise. 

NON-COMPETE/CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

When you became an AMPS employee, you signed a confidentiality and non-compete agreement promising to maintain company information in strict confidence.  The provisions of the confidentiality agreement include a non-compete agreement, which is in effect for 24 months after you leave AMPS.  The non-compete and confidentiality provisions are in effect, and we would like to remind you of your responsibility not to share proprietary company information with new employers or competitors of AMPS until the expiration of the 24-month period.  If you have any questions, please refer to the employment agreement which you signed when you became an AMPS employee.

Subject: Community Relations Tables Report


Hello Everyone:
 
As you may know, Community Relations sends the ""Tables Report"" on a weekly basis. This is a detailed list that includes information about the tables which Enron has purchased to support various non-profits. If an Enron employee has volunteered to fill a table, their name will appear in the far right column. Please share this information with the Executive with which you work, as we would like to utilize every table that we buy. When an Enron employee volunteers to fill a table, we encourage them to leverage it by inviting co-workers, customers, community leaders, etc. 
 
If you volunteer to fill a table, it is important that you immediately let me know, and I will serve as the liaison with the non-profit organization.

Attached is the updated Community Relations Tables Report.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me directly.

Thanks,

"RE: Harassment Training","David,

I guess I think that it is not worth the fight these days.  I suppose would approve this training, but I think we need to have an understanding w/ Ogletree about travel time, travel expenses, billing rates, etc.  They need to understand who holds the purse strings, and I do not think it would be appropriate for them to bill their full hourly rate for time spent on travel given that we could find someone local to do the same training -- or could send me or Lizzette to do it for the cost of travel only.    For your information, David, there is nothing magic about the training they are doing.  It is standard training that I used to deliver frequently when I was in private practice.  Ogletree does not have a monopoly on it.

I'll try to call you early this week, now that the other work I have been focusing on may slow down a bit.

Attached is a signed version of the Consulting Services Agreement between Enron and Andersen Consulting (now Accenture).  Yevgeny Frolov in HR is working on a project whereby Accenture is developing software for Enron.  Enron will own the content of the programs, and ultimately, licenses will be sold for the software, with Enron and Accenture sharing the royalty interest.

I think that your expertise is needed on this agreement.  I will send you a copy of the latest term letter, along with my handwritten comments on the draft.  

Would it be possible to get your comments/thoughts on these?  Yevgeny will contact you directly.

Please give me your feedback as soon as possible.

Yesterday in Wes Colwell's floor meeting a possible Severance Plan scenario was discussed.  The Severance Plan is under review and at this time we do not have a defined plan in place.  Once we know exactly what the plan will look like we will communicate to you as quickly as possible.  We are sorry for any misunderstanding there may be.

I hope all is well with you. Rob Walls has asked me to contact you relating to the payments that Enron needs to make based on the ECI and my own Employment agreement.
 
As I mentioned in my previous emails and messages these payments are late for a number of months now and it has become extremely URGENT from my standpoint that they are made immediately. I realise a lot is going on at Enron and that you must be very busy but this matter is really long overdue as well as fairly simple so please let me know what I need to do or who at Enron I need to contact in order to receive the payments.
 
Beginning Monday I can be contacted by email at diomedes@cumulouscapital.com  or by phone at my office in London (011-44-20-70728410). Today and tomorrow I can be contacted in Rioat the following numbers: 011-55-21-24957893/24913777.

Thanks for the message.  We had about 2 inches of water in the house and we
lost most of our flooring on the first floor. Most everything else is ok.
No flood insurance because we are not in the 100 year flood plain as you
know.

Regarding Midwest Generation.  I asked around with our Chicago lawyers and
did not find out anything.  I have made some other contacts and will let you
and Jeff Hodge (whom I have met) know if I hear about anything.

Kerry,

We drove by your house, which looked like it took on some water.  I hope
all is ok, and that you didn't have too  much damage.  Bellaire was hit
pretty hard.

On another note, if you are able to gather any more info on this Midwest
Generation issue, would you please call Jeff Hodge in our legal department?
Twanda can connect you.

I'll be on vacation this week and will return the 18th.

Thanks.

Jeff Hodges has told me that you are helping us out with trying to locate
information re: the Midwest Generation Labor Dispute.  The following
article appeared in the Chicago Tribune today:


Under a settlement agreement signed with the National Labor Relations
Board, Midwest Generation LLC, a wholesale power supplier to Commonwealth
Edison Co., will begin negotiating as early as next week with the union
representing 1,150 of its electrical workers, officials said. The move
comes less than two weeks after the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers local authorized a strike. The sides have disagreed over when the
current contract expires; under a separate agreement, Midwest Generation
was released from its obligation to maintain the existing contract through
June 2002, company officials said.





Would there be any way to obtain details about this, or is it probably a
confidential settlement?


Thanks for the advice.





Phil

Of all bizarre twists.  Please see message below.  Malme has purchased an
employment practices liability insurance policy (EPLI) and we are scheduled
to do the audit required by the insurance company.  While Texas conflicts
law probably would not make this a conflict because it is not like or
related to other work we have done for Enron, California conflict laws
apparently are more strict.  Could you confirm that Enron does not have a

"Re: Consulting Services Agreement","Hi, Janel,

I thought that I initialed those already.  If I didn't, I'll do it when I get back after my vacation next week.

In the meantime, go ahead and forward them to the counterparty for signatures on both originals and then have someone at VP level sign for Corp.  If I didn't initial, you should get them initialed before giving them to the corporate officer, because company policy requires attorney initials on all legal documents before signature.

Once signed, the original goes to the vault; we can take care of that for you.

I'll be out next week, but if you have questions, please call Diane Goode, who works in my group.  She can either assist you or find someone else who can.

Thanks.

Hi Michelle,

I received the two executable copies of the CSA between Enron and KDS Communications.  I'm not sure what the next step is.  Should I overnight these to Ken to sign and then receive them back and sign on this end and he gets one and we get one?  And I'm assuming that no one else in legal has to sign off at this point?  I thought Linda Glynn mentioned something about Richard or someone else providing initials???  

Just let me know.  thanks!

Also does legal keep a copy or do we keep the contract with us?

My understanding from Doug Miller is that he was taking a position at Calpine.  I indicated to him that he was still under an Evergreen Clause on his employment agreement.  I believe that there is some confusion with employees under a standard agreement where they think that there time to sit out 3 months post their agreement not 3 months following there termination with Enron.  I explained this to Doug and he stated that he needed to work and would continue with his plans to go to Calpine since he had to look after his family.  That being said, I spoke with Michelle Cash and she thought we needed to hold him to the non compete. She suggested that I speak with the business unit to assess their interest.  What are your thoughts?

I agree with Lizzette's view of the persons who don't sign the release; I believe that they probably have quit.  If, however, they rescind their application before termination, it is not a voluntary term.  If the situation arises, however, I think we should reevaluate at that time.

I'll be glad to review and edit, and to prepare a separation agreement.  Michelle, do you think we need to have NY counsel review the separation agreement?

On the question of rescinding the agreements, I think that an employee who rescinds a separation agreement may not be entitled to anything because the person still has voluntarily quit and isn't entitled to any severance under any plan.  But for employees who try to rescind the application for voluntary severance (ie say they don't want to quit at all), I think we've led them to believe that they can do so without repercussion.  So, I would say that they remain employees who (1) ultimately still can choose to voluntarily quit, or (2) may be selected for termination, in which case we may owe severance.  Michelle, do you agree?

Michelle, Lizzette,

We have extended our application deadline to 9AM Monday since many employees have been asking for more consideration time.

I expect by Tues, Weds next week we will have determined which employees applications will be accepted.  With this in mind, can I ask you to take a look at the following acceptance and rejection letters?  These were used in London's program, and will need to be edited for use in the US.

Additionally, can you send me a copy of the Separation and Release Agreement to be used for the Voluntary Program?  I would like to familiarize the business leads on what it will contain.  Can you please ensure that the Agreement contains verbiage reference payment subject to adequate performance (per the Plan document).

We anticipate that the termination dates for the first wave of employees leaving under the is Program would leave by 12/31/2001. This means that the latest I can get the Agreement to them is Nov 15 so they will have the full 45 day consideration period.  With such a narrow timeline, I will try my best to get you all the information for effected employees soon as possible so that you will have time to prepare the Agreements.

Also, what happens in the event that the employee rescinds the Separation & Release Agreement?  Do they then, by default, receive involuntary severance?

Thanks
Cathy

Importance:	High

Mary & Pam -- Diomedes has sent me a number of messages this week asking about the status of the payment(s) under the ECI Buyout Agreement.  I have been putting him off now for several weeks but he is justifiably asking for an explanation as to what the issue is.  He is planning to be in Houston tomorrow and Friday and wanted to know who he could talk to about this, short of calling Ken Lay.  It may be most appropriate for him to simply call Ken but I'd like to know from you how you would you like to handle this.  

Based on my reading of the contract, I believe it is clear that we owe him (i.e., ECI) payments under the ECI contract and that we do not have the right to set off payments he owes us against payments we owe ECI.  The ECI contract provides interest on late payments of the greater of Chase's prime rate plus 2% or 14%, which interest is currently accruing on the past due amounts.  I think it would be helpful if we could arrange a call with some or all of the group copied on this email to discuss further how to proceed.  Thanks.

Michelle,
We may reap the most benefit by having all the site HR Managers, Site Safety
Supervisors/Nurse Practitioners, Mike Indivero, Tony Bolar Softich(Safety),
Steve Olenik(Safety), Sean Mayer(Construction), Frank Petty(Director of
Construction), Mike Ranz(VP Construction), Bob Black(Manager Of Projects),
maybe a few other home office construction managers selected by Mike Ranz or
Frank Petty in attendance. I think you and Rick need to chair the meeting
because you will lend credibility and importance to the issue. You may even
want to invite whoever is John Gillis's boss(or his designee) to sit in to
emphasize the importance of this issue. Too often I hear ""Enron has plenty
of money"" and ""Thats why we have lawyers"" -the truth being we are the
guardians of our stockholders assets and we have a fudiciary responsibility
to protect those assets for the health and well being of the company, the
stockholders and the employees of Enron Corp. My experience has been that we
do a good deal of back stabbing and finger pointing when HR, Safety and
Construction get together and meet on anything. Liability/Settlement checks
regardless of the amount needs to be an issue along with the improvement of
the employment offer process and who is authorized to make decisions
effecting employment offers. In the end if supervisors or managers fail to
act prudently and in the best interest of the company then there is a
penalty. The penalty being they won't get the opportunity to lose more of
the companies money by making reckless decisions. Thats the approach I would
take with these people. The Weigle case does not need to be looked at like
it only cost us $490.00. This continued reckless disregard we have in our
decision making process is going to hit us big one of these days and we will
replace Foster Wheeler's Blue Island Racial Graffitti charge & settlement as
something the EPC Industry talks about. I may be overreacting here but I've
been in the middle of Nepco's harassment, discrimination other issues for
the last 18 months. Call me if you have any questions. Thanks for asking.

It is my understanding from Scott that you need to complete the new employment agreement.

We always use the info in SAP on checking accounts (per below).  Janie checks the info before wiring.  

I can call Vicky to get her to verify, but that will delay the submission of the wire.

Michelle,

This check was dated 12/3 and was for $28,228.  It is my understanding that the bank will reject any check in excess of $15,000.   
 
If we replace this check, it will be rejected again since it is over $15,000.  Are we authorized to make these type of payments via a wire transfer, or would we still be in violation of the payroll order?  If we can not process it as a wire, can it be processed on the 12/31 semi-monthly paycheck?

Thanks,
Diane

Subject:	Income Tax Settlement Reimbursement Check from Enron

Robin Treadwell deposited a check from Enron relating to the tax settlement statement prepared by Price and sent to Enron demonstrating that Enron owes me US$28,228.00.  Robin deposited the check from Enron into my bank account last Thursday evening, December 13th.  On Friday, I mailed via FedEx my tax return with a check in the amount of $32,127.00.  The IRS received the check and my return on Monday, December 17.  

Today I checked my account electronically and there was only $7,000 in the account.  I called Wells Fargo Bank because the amount did not balance with my records.  The Bank informed me that the Enron check is not credited in my account because the Enron check was not honored.  They don't show that the IRS has yet forwarded my tax check, but if it has not already been received and returned to the IRS IT WILL CERTAINLY HIT MY BANK TODAY.  Enron's bank notified my bank last night that the Enron check is being returned due to non-payment and that the maker of the check needs to be notified.  Enron's bank will not give further information as to the exact reason.

Please contact me immediately as to how Enron is planning to solve this problem.

Regards,

Vicky

This is really great news!  I think that we need to let her know that Dale is interested in having her transfer to his group but we still have the outstanding issue of the promissory note.  We need to let her know that she needs to take care of that matter or she will not be able to retain her employment with Enron.  Since she has had it for quite some time we need to give her a short window to comply.  What do you think?

Valeria/Michelle -  Chevondra was offered a 30-day trail period working for Dale Neuner and if she was successful in her efforts, then she would have an option to officially transfer to Dale's department.  The trial period was complete as of November 15th and Dale has contacted EGM HR requesting the transfer of Chevondra into his group.

However, there was a contingency in Chevondra's transfer.  She was to sign a promissory note (for outstanding personal calls on a company cell phone), as well as return the company cell phone.  Shanna and I are unaware of  the cell phone or the signed promissory note being returned at this time. 

Could you please provide the recommended next steps?

I hope you are doing ok.

I thought you might be interested to learn that Victoria Sterling amended her lawsuit to add Enron as a party on Nov. 30.  Of course, the claim will be stayed due to bankruptcy, but it is interesting that she finally did it.

David, a couple of things:

1. Cheque. Will need to write you a UK cheque, have assumed an FX rate of
1.45 and and the Dollar amount is 77,919.66 , so that makes 53,737.70
Sterling. Who do I need to make the cheque out to? Can you also wait until I
give you the nod next week to cash it? The money should be in the account by
monday, but would like to make certain.

2. Could we draw up something brief in writing to cover our agreement from a
few evenings ago?

Everything hectic at present, we managed to get a removals company at short
notice, a flight back to blighty this weekend, and somewhere to stay in
London. Looking forward to working with the Enron Europe guys again.

Thanks for your help in all of this,

Jonathan

Kathy,

Would you mind re-running the list of people who are close to age 55 with 5 or are close to 5 years for vesting in cash balance plan?

We would like a 30-day cushion.

Would you please provide this data to me and Kalen?

Thanks.

   Michelle,
   This is to advise of the  action taken by NEPCO and the current status
   of the claim mentioned in the  subject line of this e-mail.  In
   maintaining contact with the OSHA  Investigator on this case, I've had
   several amiable conversations regarding  She's status and stance in the
   matter.  As you know, by virtue of my  initial call to the Investigator
   (Randall L. Ounce) NEPCO satisfied the first  requirement of the 15 day
   response window.  I advised him during that call  that NEPCO was in the
   discovery phase whereby documentation was being collected  to support
   NEPCO's position.  He admitted to not yet having dialogue with  the
   claimant and therefore took no exception to our needing more time.  He
   in fact added one additional week to the two weeks I had requested.  He
   felt it may take this long for him to review the allegations and contact
   the  claimant.  In a subsequent conversation a week later, I advised him
   of the  fact that information was still coming in about the case.
   Again, he stated  he was unable to contact the claimant despite numerous
   calls to the claimants  home.  On August 15, 2001 I completed NEPCO's
   formal response to Mr.  Koonce's which was mailed the same day
   certified-return receipt.  I called  Mr. Ounce to advise him that our
   response had been mailed.  Once more he  said that he had been unable to
   contact the claimant.  She's plan is to  send written notification to
   the claimant with a set number of days in which the  claimant must
   respond.  In the event claimant doesn't, OSHA will close the  case.  At
   this time, Mr. Ounce does not have a strong feeling the  claimant will
   respond.  Additionally, after discussion of the supporting  documents,
   timelines and the lack of response by the claimant, Mr. Ounce  admitted
   to believing this to be a classic case of employee  disgruntlement.  My
   feeling is that the case will be closed by OSHA  with no further action.
   So that you may enter it into your file, I will  mail you a hard copy of
   NEPCO's formalized response.

Two in one day.  We understand that the pipe fitters are also planning to
picket the Lake Worth, Florida project as well.  Our execution team needs to
get some guidance and planning for this picketing should it interfere with
the progress of the work.  In that respect, we need to dial in Rick Johnson
and Olgletree to plan and communicate that plan to the execution team.  I
think the first step is a call between yourself, me, Mark Stubley and Mike
Indivero.  And then another call with all folks or a meeting at the jobsite
to lay out the plan.

Barbara, please organize a call for Mike, Michelle, Mark Stubley and me.

I have been advised by our Construction Manager, Mr. Joe Osler that while he

regarding our permit status he learned that the pipefitters have inquired
about permit requirements to picket our site.  Apparently the City informed
them that no permit is required.  I have heard that the pipefitters have
established a picket line at the Payne Creek site today. We will need local
legal counsel to assist us in this regard.

"Privileged and Confidential -- Performance Bonus Language","David,

You asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance.  

The bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements with a target bonus is as follows:

	""Provided that Enron meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25% of the performance criteria under Enron's annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question, Employee's annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001, 2002, and 2003 (payable in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively), shall be based on an annual bonus target of $_____________.""

This language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's peers, but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25% of those criteria.  Thus, if there are only 3 rating categories (i.e., 1, 2, 3, distributed as 10-80-10), then only the people in the top category would be within the top 25/33% of the rating criteria.  

Given the huge change in our process, however, there is an argument that the above language cannot be applied to the current scheme and that instead, we should look at the top 25% of the peer group, instead of performance criteria, even though that was not the intent of the provision when it was drafted.

As a result, I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories (i.e., 2A, 2B, or 2C).  That way, persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A would be eligible for the target bonus.  If there is a decision not to break  down the middle 80 further, then it would be useful to look at those employees with a bonus target that we think is too high. For those employees, a more conservative approach may be to evaluate them on a scale that is more subdivided than the 10-80-10 breakdown and to document that they fell out in the bottom 75% of the categories under that process.  

Of course, it goes without saying that we should ensure consistent treatment based on race, sex, national origin, age, etc. in this process.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

agreed that there is some wiggle room because of the 30 days to pay language.  and, the waiver does address the signing bonus-- specifically states they won't get it.  
 
but with some employees, the signing bonus may exceed the amount we're offering for the waiver, so the incentive may be to not sign.  i suggest we remain open to considering paying the signing bonus if we get strong push back from an applicant.

I understand your point on this and agree that someone may try to argue that it is due to them upon signing the offer letter.  Our practice and intent has been to pay after they start, and I believe that the letter refers to payment after they start, so there is some wiggle room on the other side.

I agree that it is not a ""slam dunk"" on our part, but my view is that the risk is worth not doing anything unless and until we get some sort of demand or claim.  We then can cross the bridge as to how to proceed.  In the meantime, I am comfortable with this level of risk.

Of course, if these folks are ones to whom we are paying any money, then the waiver should address the signing bonus issue.

Ya'll let me know if you disagree.

Subject:        Revocation:  Signing Bonus 

The initial view on this was that we should not pay signing bonuses when we revoke offers of employment, but I have continued to give thought to the issue and my concerns.  It appears that our offer letters refer to the bonus as a ""sign-on bonus"" and ""signing bonus"" and state that it will be paid within 30 days of hire.  The letter does not address what to do if we revoke, or if the applicant revokes.   

I think that based on the ""signing"" language, applicants could argue that because they signed, we owe signing bonuses.  

On the other hand, signing alone really can't be enough to justify payment; I don't think anyone would buy off on the idea that an applicant could sign, refuse to show up, and still be owed the bonus.  

Balancing those considerations, I think a viable argument can be made that an applicant who signs and professes a willingness to still show up must be paid the promised signing bonus.  As such, I think we have some exposure here.  I can't assess how much, in part because I don't have an estimate of the dollars at issue.  I do, however, understand that we plan to revoke approximately 100 offers, not necessarily all of which will involve signing bonuses. 

Any thoughts?

Irma, 
Thank you, for taking to time to meet with Cheryl and I.   We hope this simple plan will make it easier and faster to get the information we all need. 

I prepared the attached as minutes to our meeting, if you will.  It is intended to help us remember how we are to handle the American Express issues with your group going forward. 

Please let me know if you have any corrections or additions. 
Thanks again, 
Johnny and Cheryl

I think the issue is that if they only have one client then they could be considered employees from a 'discrim/coverage' standpoint.  The issue is probably not in the area of insured plans but the qualified plans.  The 410(b) is our adequate coverage test for the pension plan.

Michelle, I was presented with some interesting information yesterday
and I wanted to run it by you . . . I was not told this by an ERISA
attorney but it was a person who works with Benefits frequently.  The
person told me that, if a company only had one customer, the company's
employees had to be included in the control group of the customer for
discrimination testing purposes on the benefits plans.  It sounded a
little iffy to me . . . could you verify?  Thanks.

"Privileged and Confidential -- website","FYI, the attached article and story is disturbing and surprising about Southern Company.
 
It also raises an issue that we could face if we are not careful.  The article discusses internal diversity studies, which the plaintiffs are using as evidence to support their claims.  The company claims that the studies were done by people who did not know how to conduct the appropriate analyses under the relevant legal standards.  
 
I have this concern here, as well, when we have people running analyses that do not factor in the legal standards and instead try to interpret data themselves.  I would like to talk about how to manage that.  Let me know who you think should be included in such a meeting, and I'll set something up.
 
Thanks.

Cheryl:
 
In light of your comments below, it now seems wise for us to schedule a meeting with you to find out which employees will move to Enron and agree on additional information we will need.  Also, if Enron staff will be doing all the back office/logistics, I'm assuming some sort of services agreement will be put in place.  At a minimum, I suggest Noel, Michelle Cash and I meet with you.  Shanna may or may not attend, but we would need to coordinate compensation with Shanna to maintain equity within the Coal marketing group.
 
I'll have my assistant, Elisa Tamez, contact you to set up a meeting for next Monday or Tuesday.
 
Thanks.

Cindy: Thank you for your response.  Our current plan is that the three marketers that Triton currently employs will become employees of Enron.  This will facilitate the coordination with our existing marketers and logistics people.  Enron will also handle all of the scheduling, sampling, and ""back office"" support.  As such, we may or may not need additional people for these tasks.  We will keep you posted once we know more about the needs of our group from an HR perspective.

Due to the new structure of the deal, no further HR information will be required.  Would appreciate further description on how Enron will market the Triton coal, i.e., do we need to help find additional coal marketers/originators, or will we use existing Coal Group and Triton marketers to handle this.  You may not have answers to this yet, but if we can help coordinate through Shanna and/or our recruiting group, please let us know.

Subject: Fireball - Update!



All: 

As some of you know, and many may not, we are still working on Project Fireball. Over the past month we have been negotiating with the Vulcan investors to create a structure that benefits both Vulcan and Enron.  We have gone from a structure where Enron would own 100% of the company to one that includes some equity, debt, and marketing. We feel fairly confident that we are close to agreeing on a deal that will involve the following basic components:

Enron will pay Vulcan $ 100 million cash for the following: 
        $  40 million will be to purchase somewhere around 18% to 19% of the equity in Triton Coal Company 
        $  60 million will be to refinance subordinated debt that Vulcan currently has with UBS (Enron will then provide financing of this $60 MM)

        Enron will become the exclusive marketer for Triton coal and will receive a fee on each ton of coal sold (based on % of sales price)

We have indicated to Vulcan that we can close this deal within 30 days of their notification of acceptance of our bid. Some final due diligence issues need to be addressed by Enron before closing. The attached file includes a list of due diligence items that we have requested that are still outstanding.  Many of these may not apply, now that we will not purchase the entire company. Once Vulcan has accepted our bid we will need to move quickly and will need to let Triton know what outstanding issues we have to resolve. Please review this list and let me know by Monday afternoon of any items that we do not require in light of the new structure of the deal.

We will set meetings with many of you for Monday and Tuesday of next week to ensure a smooth closing process if we are selected.  Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks to everyone for your continued support on this deal. 

Regards, 
Cheryl

"PR Internet Issue","I have had some research done on the issue of what was found on the computers in the Ecoelectrica offices.  It looks like the best course of action is to destroy all of the identified materials.  Mere possession of these materials is a violation of law.  Our outside counsel called the FBI, which said that if the company does not know who put the materials out there, it does not have  a duty to report it.

We also received advice that the Puerto Rico office of the FBI might be able to assist in narrowing down the possible users to determine who actually was involved.  Our outside counsel suggested that we might want to call the local FBI office and talk with a duty agent.  The number is 787-754-6000.  Given the situation of the possible sale, however, we may choose not to take that route.

In any event, if we don't report it, all illegal materials must be destroyed and removed from our systems as soon as possible.

I have been getting this question a lot!

It has been communicated to every employee that if they are in Category 5, they will get a PIP.  Therefore, I recommend putting one in place.  If you are more comfortable, you can re-name it to reflect goals and objectives for the next review period -- something like ""Performance Objectives"" or something to that effect.

Hi Michelle,

For those employees that landed in Category 5 due to misclassification of job group, is it sufficient to address in the evaluation and not complete a PIP?  The employee is by no means performing poorly and presenting her with a PIP would be a contradicting message.

Through the process of the PRC, we identified that this particular person who is a Specialist was really doing an Entry Specialist job and would have faired fairly well in the lower job group, however because we had them in the Specialist job group, she did not fair so well relative to her Specialist peers.

Just want to make sure I'm not breaking any policy by making this exception.

Thanks,
Cathy

The following is the email I sent Aaron last week.  I called him this morning to confirm if this was accurate.  He's meeting later today with Mary Joyce and said he'll get back to me.  I did not inquire specifically about NuTech--I assume Michelle is doing that.

Teresa





Aaron:

Based on our conversations, it is my understanding that the compensation committee has asked to review compensation plans for our affiliates if we own approximately 50% or more of the company.  The determination of exactly which plans must go to the committee will be made by Mary Joyce upon receipt of a bullet point presentation of the key terms of the plan.  The committee would likely review any compensation plan pursuant to which (i) employees receive equity interests without making capital contributions in cash or other property with reasonably equivalent value to the equity interests, (ii) employees receive equity interests prior to Enron recovering its investment, or (iii) employees are to be offered employment agreements with terms that are not within ""Enron norms.""  In addition, all significant terms of the compensation plan are to be disclosed in the DASH.

Do I understand this all corrrectly?  Is there anything I have omitted?

If the committee meets only quarterly, timing could certainly be an issue in some transactions.  If that is the case, can special meetings be called?

This is a kid-friendly event with a street party twist - we'll start with a casual dinner at 5pm at the Goodrows then, weather permitting, travel by foot, wagon, stroller, bicycles, scooters or similar modes to the Lights in the Heights Street Party a few blocks away.

We'll send out better invitations next week.  But please mark your calendars and inform your household event coordinators now.

Subject:	

Just got off conference call with Wachovia to review trust arrangement particularly to ensure that this is effective in not triggering tax until time of payment rather than triggering tax at funding of trust.  We think this arrangement does that as long as the following is true:
Funds put in trust should not be paid out until 2002 to provide for ""service period/vesting"" requirement
Must be irrevocable i.e. funds can never come back to employer so need to be careful not to overfund

Also, to keep from being subject to ERISA, need to assume that payments are not delayed until termination.  (IF subject to ERISA, creates ugly reporting/compliance issues and discrimination testing.....)

 The issue of whether to set up a new employer i.d. to hold the trust is a question - might provide more security and protection in the event of bankruptcy but might create tax deductibility issues.  Might be better if we could set up subparts for different employers to ensure tax deductibility.  I will run by external tax counsel with utmost discretion.  

If this is to be used for non-U.S. employees, need to ensure arrangement doesn't trigger taxable event at funding due to local tax law.  May not be an issue.

Are we contemplating including any insiders?

Dear Brad and Michelle:

I have reviewed the letter from Tobias Munk.

Has Enron determined that it will no longer be involved with DealBench.com and given permission to allow Mr. Munk to independently raise funds for a proposed management buy-out or sale to an independent third party?  or Has Enron determined that it will not go forward with DealBench.com at this time, but it is possible in the future that it will still be involved with DealBench.com?  I note that Mr. Munk states that Enron is actively seeking a buyer for the platform.  What discussions have taken place with respect to a transaction for the purchase of DealBench.com.   

Regardless of Mr. Munk's intentions, as stated in his letter of August 7, 2001, Enron must make a determination to allow Mr. Munk to use Enron's idea, etc. for DealBench.com as it is proprietary and belongs to Enron and not Mr. Munk.  If Enron has made the decision to sell DealBench.com and Mr. Munk, now no longer an Enron employee, is able to put together a group to purchase this Internet platform, I don't believe that this would constitute a violation of the Conflict of Interests Policy as described in Enron's Code of Ethics. 

It appears that Mr. Munk is requesting permission from Enron to move forward with respect to DealBench.com as described in his letter. 

Please confirm Enron's intentions with respect to DealBench.   In addition, please advise of any communications/discussions with Mr. Munk regarding DealBench.com and his ability to be a part of DealBench.com in the event he finds a buyer or becomes part of a group which purchases DealBench.com.

Thanks.

I agree that it is not a ""slam dunk"" on our part, but my view is that the risk is worth not doing anything unless and until we get some sort of demand or claim.  We then can cross the bridge as to how to proceed.  In the meantime, I am comfortable with this level of risk.

Of course, if these folks are ones to whom we are paying any money, then the waiver should address the signing bonus issue.

Ya'll let me know if you disagree.

Subject:	Revocation:  Signing Bonus

The initial view on this was that we should not pay signing bonuses when we revoke offers of employment, but I have continued to give thought to the issue and my concerns.  It appears that our offer letters refer to the bonus as a ""sign-on bonus"" and ""signing bonus"" and state that it will be paid within 30 days of hire.  The letter does not address what to do if we revoke, or if the applicant revokes.   

I think that based on the ""signing"" language, applicants could argue that because they signed, we owe signing bonuses.  

On the other hand, signing alone really can't be enough to justify payment; I don't think anyone would buy off on the idea that an applicant could sign, refuse to show up, and still be owed the bonus.  

Balancing those considerations, I think a viable argument can be made that an applicant who signs and professes a willingness to still show up must be paid the promised signing bonus.  As such, I think we have some exposure here.  I can't assess how much, in part because I don't have an estimate of the dollars at issue.  I do, however, understand that we plan to revoke approximately 100 offers, not necessarily all of which will involve signing bonuses. 

Any thoughts?

I look forward to meeting with you this week when I visit NEPCO.

I wanted to alert you to an OSHA investigation that was served on us here in Houston.  Specifically, an employee named Jason Davis claims that he was fired from  his job in Jenks because he complained about unsafe conditions there.  OSHA has sent a request for information, as it is going to conduct an investigation.

Subject:	HR Reminder - Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)

To Corporate HR Generalists,  Compensation and Payroll

Periodically, I plan to communicate refreshers on the FLSA and its requirements for both exempt and non-exempt employees.  For this communication, I would like to focus on compensatory time off.  While Enron does not have a formal written policy on compensatory time off, we must not forget the regulatory obligations for administering this provision of the FLSA.   I encourage each of you to share this information with your client groups.

I recently overheard a conversation in the elevator where an employee was talking about all the comp time they had accrued and how they planned to take it before yearend.  Several immediate and simultaneous thoughts went through my head -- 1) is this an exempt or nonexempt employee, 2) where is this being recorded, and 3) what if this employee gets redeployed/termed or transfers jobs--would they expect to take this time off or in the case of a nonexempt employee be paid for it?  Unfortunately, we have no way to validate comp time since we have no tracking mechanism for this.  In the case of a nonexempt employee this could become a very risky situation.

Compensatory Time Off for Non-Exempt Employees

Compensatory time off for non-exempt employees must be used in the same pay period in which it is accrued.  If an employee works overtime in a workweek which falls at the beginning of a pay period, then the employee can take time off with pay in a workweek later in the same pay period.  If an employee cannot use all of the accrued comp time by the end of the pay period, then the employee must be paid for the comp time in the paycheck for the pay period.  Any comp time which is used by nonexempt employees must be provided at the rate of one and one-half hours off with pay for every overtime hour which is worked.  There is no cost savings in the use of comp time.  

Compensatory Time Off for Exempt Employees

If an employer promises comp time to an overtime exempt employee, then the employee may be able to enforce the promise of additional compensation even though the employee was not entitled to overtime pay.  Enron's Overtime Pay and Reimbursement Policy states ""Exempt employees are not eligible for overtime pay.""   Responding to an exempt employee's claim that he or she is entitled to comp time is often difficult because records are not generally kept of exempt employee's hours of work--(I plan to devote my next communication to tracking an exempt employee's hours worked as this is often an area of confusion).  The provisions of comp time may also adversely affect the ""salary"" which must be paid for white-collar employees to be overtime exempt. 

I hope this communication will be helpful and I welcome any feedback or suggested topics you may want additional information about.  Please feel free to pass this on to anyone I overlooked in your respective groups.

Here are the referrals that I received.  Some of the referrals came from
more than one source within our firm.

Kerry--

I suggest that you speak to Barry Cosloy at PricewaterhouseCoopers' Global
HR Practice.  Barry heads up the PwC Employment Compliance Risk Management
Solutions.  I am attaching his contact information and suggest that you
contact him directly.  I am also attaching two presentations that describe
the exact type of practice group you need.

Kerry,

I have been networking with William M. Mercer Company, a subsidiary of Marsh
McLennan Companies.  They are one of the largest, if not the largest, human
resources consulting firms in the world.  They have 15,000 employees and
offices all over the country.  They are clearly the top in their field.
Here is a contact person in Houston: Philip Tenenbaum in Mercer's Houston
office.  Philip can be reached at 713-653-5253. Here also is some
information about Phillip and Mercer.


 <<PTenenbaum - BIO.doc>>  <<Mercer overview.doc>>

Kerry:

I have a strong relationship with Hewitt.  I forwarded an edited version of
your e-mail to my primary contact at Hewitt and inquired as to who he
recommends in Houston.  Below is Dick's response.  Hopefully, this will be
useful to you.

Christy


Christy, we'd certainly appreciate it if you suggested Hewitt. We have a
rather
large center in the Woodlands, which is just outside Houston. Also, we have
a
number of consultants who work on the issues mentioned.

You could suggest Don Henderson as an initial contact. Don is a benefits
lawyer
in the Houston (i.e.., Woodlands) office who could help them locate the best
Hewitt resource for the client. Don's number is 281-363-0456  I'm copying
Don in
case he has a suggestion of someone else who the client might contact.

It was good seeing you at the reception. Thanks for thinking of us!

I'm faxing you a letter I received this morning from attorney's representing Thomas Gramlich.

To refresh your memory, Tom was the chap that resigned in May but had a 6 months notice period in his MG employment letter.  He was the head sales person in our Lead Trading Group and given that he is going to work for a competitor, we wanted to use all of his notice period to keep him out of the market for as long as possible until we could find a suitable replacement.  September 26 would be the end of his notice period and his attorneys are proposing a June 30th release date.

As notice periods are not enforceable in the US, our hands may be tied, but I wanted to keep you advised.  Please let me know if you think there is anything we can do.

The plaintiff's attorney is Robin Harrison.  I know Robin quite well.  He does not do that much employment work, and is more of a commercial litigator.

key questions that would be great to answer for current employees before Friday:

-Vacation policy, we should be able to answer this one ourselves. do we really need Weil's input?
-Severance, obviously part of the retention request to the courts, but can we say that they will get no less than $4500?
-Parking subsidy/bus subsidy-i'm tracking this with Steve Kean
-business expenses paid pre-petition, part of the clarification to courts. just so you know, George Wasaff is not processing any expenses pre-filing across the board.



I would love to be able to answer vacation, i think we should draft the following:

-Carry over is 1 week, with exceptions approved by manager (Michelle, David is concerned to put out a blanket 2 week carry over as there are only pockets of people working all hours to year end)
-We will pro-rate starting Jan 1 2002.  So when people are termed, they will receive prorated vacation, not full as in past, plus any carry over.

Why can't we get this one out?

"Proposed visit","Dear Grandmother,

So sorry we didn't make it  yesterday.  We went shopping, and Cameron hurt his finger while he was riding on the shopping cart  -- nothing major, but it distracted me so much that all other things left my mind.  Oops!!!  He had to have a special kind of bandage, but it doesn't hurt him any more, so I think all is going to be ok.  So, I apologize for not making it yesterday.

Hope all is well with you.

Nice kudos from Robert.

Would you mind keeping Diane Goode in the loop on this.  As you may recall, she had done a summary of the legal requirements and sent it on to the generalists.  They now are calling her for help, so her knowing what you are doing is essential.

Thanks.

"RE: Jon Solem's resume","Tara,

Thanks so much for sending me your friend's resume.  He certainly has a strong academic and work history.

Unfortunately, it is not Enron's practice to hire attorneys right out of law school.  We prefer that our candidates have at least 4-6 years (minimum) experience at a big law firm or substantial corporate law department before they are eligible for consideration here.  The rationale is that we have so much to do that we really cannot provide adequate training, which is critical for new lawyers; nor can we take the time necessary to supervise and review work of lawyers who don't have the requisite experience.

So, please thank your friend for his interest.  If you would like, I would be happy to visit with him about other types of opportunities in the legal profession, from law firms to some corporate legal departments that do hire straight out of law school.  Alternatively, he may be a candidate for the Associate and Analyst Program, if he doesn't want to practice law.

Call me with any questions.

Michelle

Subject:	Emails on Terrorism Audit and Consultant

Michelle:

After I sent you my prior emails, Garry Mathiason responded with the
following emails on the two subjects that you raised.  Garry usually has
helpful insights so I thought I would pass them along:

Regarding the terrorism audit, this is an ""external"" threat assessment and
requires a qualified security company.  I think that Johnathan Tal could do
such an audit as well as some other more established security firms.

 <<Johnathan Tal>>

Regarding the HR consultant, the potential list is endless.  I have some top
level contacts with Delotte's Human Capital group.  Meanwhile, I think the
best non-attorney group on downsizing is probably  Right and Associates.
This is an area that we (Littler) have developed into a science.  At Cisco,
HP, AA, AOL, Solection, etc. we have advised on many of this issues.  Call
me if you would like specifics.  Garry

Michelle, here is the local contact for Right & Associates whom I have met:

 <<Joe A. Bowden>>

It does not look like we have an off-the-shelf memo on legal issues related
to Terrorism, but with our workplace violence work, we probably can put
something together less expensively and more thoroughly than other firms.
Let me know what we can do to help.

Attached is the latest draft of a memo outlining the changes to severance, vacation, et al.  While I know that we don't have a decision on severance, Michelle Cash and I have discussed most likely only being able to include a link to the restated plan.  If we do that, any language in the memo related to severance will be very generic.  I've also added information about the suspension of the Educational Assistance Program.  (Q: Rick, is the cut off date Nov. 2002, or should it be 2001?)  Let me know your thoughts when possible.  We'd like to send this as soon as we get word from David that a plan has been selected.

 << File: Policy change notice email.doc >> 
Michelle, when we know which plan is selected, we'd still like to have some summary language/talking points we can provide HR generalists and supervisors to help them briefly explain the plan as they are talking with employees.

Michelle,

This is a heads up to an issue developing this morning at a project site in
Payne Creek, Florida.  As far as we know, the union is directing the
picketing against the general contractor, OCI (a subsidiary of B&V), and not
NEPCO who is the subcontractor to OCI.  Rick Johnson may want to
investigate.

By copy to Gail, Seth Price will evaluate whether additional claims are
developed against OCI for any delay impacts caused by OCI to NEPCO or vice
versa depending on who the union pipe fitters are picketing.

The pipefitters union is picketing OCI at the Payne Creek jobsite this
morning. There are 4 pickets at the gate on Ft. Green Road. The gate system
at the entrance has no designation as to union and non-union so they can
picket any gate. The picket signs reference low wages according to Greg
Renz. OCI has an agreement with Forida Maint. union ironworkers to perform
work. Pipefitters think they should be doing the work. I am going to Payne
Creek to meet with our supervisors on how to conduct themselves when they
enter and exit the jobsite. At this point no activity is being directed at
Nepco. We want to keep it that way.
Call me on my cell phone if you need me.

"RE: Emergency Check In Policy","I have looked at the policy and have no major issue with it, except to the extent that it may be either duplicative or different from policies that Corp. is looking to implement.

I agree with Paul's approach on the practice aspect as well as the statement that management will take reasonable steps to look for their unaccounted-for personnel.

Paul, it might make sense for you to talk with Robert Jones and David Oxley, who are looking at overall security issues in the wake of the terrorist attacks.

Can't this be communicated as a simple Field Ops ""practice"" going forward instead of Policy? I'd rather see it be sold as  ""this makes sense for all of us to do"" vs. ""do this because it is Policy"" Additionally, what will be the consequences for not adhering to policy? Shouldn't we also state management will proactively track down their employees and together we will account for everyone's safety.

Team,

Please consider the policy outlined below to be effective immediately.



EMERGENCY CHECK IN POLICY
FOR
EBS FIELD OPERATIONS EMPLOYEES


In light of the recent tragedies that occurred in New York City and Washington, D.C., Enron Broadband Services Field Operations is adopting a new policy that requires field operations personnel to check-in during unusual situations and emergencies, whether natural or man-made.  Through this check in, management will be able to ensure that any and all necessary measures are taken to provide for the safety of employees. 

Therefore, in the event of a disaster or emergency, all EBS employees and contractors shall call the Network Operations Center in Houston at 800 267-7028, as soon as they can do so safely, to advise EBS management of their status.  Since some personnel may be traveling or on a temporary assignment known only to their immediate supervision, all personnel are requested to check-in, not only those physically assigned to a location near the event.  Personnel on vacation or other leave should also make an effort to check-in so their safety can be assured as well. Phone contact is preferable, however, email or other communication services are acceptable. When you make the call, please provide the following information:

Name
Phone number where you can be reached
Immediate Supervisor
Current location
Assigned location
Any assistance required

It is the goal and focus of the company to provide a safe and secure work atmosphere for all employees.  Should you have any other further suggestions in this regard, please forward them to Herb Caballero, our safety manager, who is charged with developing policies to ensure your safety.

Regards,

Allan Grimm
Senior Director, Field Operations

Andrea, in response to Michelle's concerns about legal review of our Affirmative Action Plans, Please consider the following:

Background:   
?	Affirmative Action Plan development is supported by specific software that was implemented in January 2000.  
?	The Plans consist of two primary elements, the narrative portion and the statistical portion. 
?	Narrative was reviewed for legal merit in January 2000 by George Chaffee, Attorney at Law, Littler Mendelson, Walnut Creek, CA and by a local consultant, George Pharis, President, Strategic Direction Resources Inc. 
o	Recommended changes were incorporated into the FY 2000 AAPs.  The narrative section of an AAP is generally the same each year with few changes necessary.
?	The statistical portion requires an intense amount of labor each year.  The database of the plan has to be confirmed for accuracy
?	Plans are reviewed against the previous year's AAP for continuity
?	Once we have drafts of the AAP (narrative and statistical portion) for a business unit:
o	Draft plan and a memo are sent to the business unit HR head for review
o	HR head requests any changes and confirms their buy-in before the plan is finalized and distributed to their organization
o	Execution signatures are obtained
o	Plans are distributed to management level employees to guide their hiring/promotion and termination decisions throughout the course of the plan year.
o	Quarterly utilization reports are completed and sent to the business units to allow them to track their progress achieving AAP goals
o	If a ""new goal"" is warranted from quarterly reports, it is highlighted for the business unit to consider as they move forward through the rest of the year

Recommendations:

?	02 Plan narratives drafted and reviewed by appropriate legal counsel.  (Complete no later than Y/E 2001)
	o	OFCCP changes to regulations became effective December 13, 2000.  New Regs have reduced some narrative   
            requirements however underlying responsibilities are still implied  
?	AAP Plan drafts provided to HR Head and respective legal counsel for review, change, and approvals before being submitted for execution signatures
?	OLER to revise and communicate new execution milepost to get AAPs completed. Earliest data access date is Jan 15 - (reflecting Y/E promotions, terms etc)  

OLER is committed to supporting an effective AAP process for client units.  Please assist us by sharing you interests and perspectives on the recommendations offered.   

Regards, Rj.

Michelle,

Have you had situations in the past where we've needed to set up a company/LLC to house employees separate from EGM/Enron Americas, etc.?

I'm working with limited information, but the Freight group has a potential deal where they will buy a trucking company and need a place to house the workers outside of EGM.  Another idea we are considering is using an outsourcing company, similar to Administaff, but this is expensive and it will be difficult to find somone to take on the liabilities associated with this type of workforce.

Thanks,

"Dynegy Request","David,

Late last week, I received a call from Kristen Kracraft, who does employment law at Dynegy.  She indicated that they would like for there to be a protocol for how to handle things if there is a desire to allow the hiring of employees from Dynegy to Enron or vice versa.  Of course, such hiring would have to be coordinated at the top of the company to avoid any type of free-for-all.  At a minimum, I would think that you and Andrea Lang would have to be the ones who make the decisions.  With that thought, I have asked Tim O'Rourke's team to work on such a protocol.

In the meantime, Kristen mentioned that one person in Rick Shapiro's group wants to go to Dynegy.  She understood that Shapiro had said it was ok.  Do you know about that?  If not, should you give Andrea a call about it?  I am concerned about the floodgate effect, so I believe we should proceed with extreme caution.

Let me know your thoughts on this.

As I get ready for this mediation, I thought that these various presentations to ECT senior management (McConnell, Pres. of HPL, Rice and Hannon) would be helpful.  Special attention to the Hannon presentation which clearly shows that the real benefits of this new company were NOT primarily related to the monetization of the equipment (which Bill Rome contends), but instead were related to new business earnings and substantial cost savings.  This also has proved itself out as we go forward.

Kathy,

Cindy was contacted by the Greater Houston Partnership.  A New York-based financial company is considering relocating nearly 400 jobs to Houston due primarily to the influx of Enron talent to the market.  The Partnership has asked Cindy to present to this group tomorrow, Thursday, evening.  One piece of information they are asking for is a demographic breakdown of the people we terminated.  I was wondering if we could pull together numbers by job classification and level.  Here's what I invision:

Number of Employees Let Go 		Total: 4,500

	Trading				# 		(# Broken out by title/level)
	Financial			#		(# Broken out by title/level)
	Technical			#		(# Broken out by title/level)
	Professional			#		(# By professions included)
	Administrative			#		(# Broken out by level)
	Other				#

I'll put it into a PowerPoint slide for Cindy's presentation, but could I get the data (even if it is very rough) by about noon tomorrow?

Kathy, I know how many unreasonable requests you've had to put up with over the past few months.  I hope that this isn't another one.  Forgive me and set me straight if this can't be done.

Thank you,
Terrie

"RE: *Cuts","Lance,

Thanks for passing this message on -- it is good to know what is on the rumor mill, and nobody who knows what I do ever passes those on to me directly!

I believe that we should carefully stay away from any statement that cuts are based on mid-year PRC, as that would not be the best legal defense to have.   

Instead, HR, with assistance from legal, has put forth a matrix for businesses to use in determining which employees, if any, will be affected.  Listed on that matrix include factors such as job criticality (which is weighted to be twice as significant as any of the other factors), ability to perform several different types of jobs, business knowledge, leadership, teamwork, and historical performance over the last 18 months.  PRC results would not be the sole factor.  Otherwise, someone who is the only person who knows how to do a mission-critical job might be affected simply because he rated out lower at mid-year review.  That result obviously would be disasterous.

As we discussed, the regulations from the department of labor specifically
allow the employment of 14 to 16 year olds in non-hazardous employment.  The

Thus, don't take the interns to a power plant and don't work them past 9:00

person told me that, if a company only had one customer, the company's
employees had to be included in the control group of the customer for

Michelle,

Has the ER Marketing Campaign Roll-out been discussed with the HR heads?  If not, I think this should be an agenda item at David Oxleys next HR heads' meeting.  I met yesterday with Gary Smith and he expressed some concerns about ER marketing its services; he's concerned that it may encourage employees who have in the past handled their concerns internally or by working with their HR Reps to come out of the woodwork and swamp our resources.  I explained to him that we are not trying to drum up more business but rather ensure that employees are aware of mechanisms in place to address workplace issues.

As well, once the contract template is complete, if you could send it to me and Melissa Laing for our reference, that would be great.

Subject:	My Redeployment Experience


THIS MESSAGE IS PERSONAL  AND CONFIDENTIAL
 
Mr. Lay:
    After attending the  All Employee Meeting at The Hyatt on Thursday, August 16th during the Q&A  period, someone sent the comment stating ""Redeployment is a  Joke"". You commented and stated that if anyone had any questions or  concerns regarding this matter to shoot a e-mail to you, and you would  respond .  After that statement regarding redeployment, I felt  compelled to do just what you said-- send a message about my redeployment  experience.  I am doing this for two reasons: 1) to  prevent what has happened to me (from the HR representatives side of  redeployment) from happening to any other Enron employee whether redeployment or  any other experience with Enron's HR reps and,  2) to let  you know the redeployment process at Enron is effective and efficient  and two of  the MAIN values of Enron must be exalted higher.   Those values are Communication and  Respect.
 
 
    I received redeployment from  Enron Broadband Services- Investment group on Monday, June 18th, 2001.   Sheila Walton, a HR rep spoke to me regarding what the process would  entail.  During this meeting, Sheila mentioned the redeployment process to  me, but discussed and stressed to me more, my options  when I departed the company, rather than my options to locate another  position with the company, not at all promoting the advantage of  redeployment and its many success stories.  With no directions from Sheila  Walton, I took it upon myself to contact Joyce Barrett in the redeployment group  for advice and guidance.  I met Joyce through a info-luncheon hosted for  EBS assistants and the DoubleTree to give information about redeployment and how  the process works and it's successes.  Because of a lack of  Communication, to the redeployment department, after a  week I did not have any information about me going into redeployment,  so at the end of the week, I had no location for a redeployment desk and I  was leaving my department at the end of the week of June 18-22.   
 
    Due to this lack of  communication, I had to take off Monday & Tuesday June 25th, 26th, to have  my desk churned and locate a space for me for 45 days.  Joyce Barrett  contacted me with a location and more information regarding my redeployment  process.  Located in 3 Allen Center, I set-up my search for  a ""new"" job at Enron, and my goal was to do my best to find a job  within Enron because that was a opportunity that I felt I owed myself and  Enron as a whole, by becoming Enron proud and believing in the visions  and values.  I met with Marie Jensen of Spearion to review my resume  and sharpen my interview tactics.  Joyce  Barrett, Michele Hargrave and Brinella Knight were in contact with me to find  out how my job search was going and lending support in any way.   I  had many interviews with companies outside and within Enron.  An  experience to meet new and interesting people and a opportunity that I feel  I would have not been able to have without redeployment, so I  have no regrets about being redeployment.   I must tell you  that I was afraid, because a lot about this process, I was unsure of and my  HR rep did nothing to assure me or inform me that this transition  is one that can be rewarding, as well as a strong  challenge.
 
    With Enron's values  system, Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence in place and  strongly promoted by you  and Jeff Skilling (before his  departure), I want to stress to you that my experience with the HR side of  redeployment, has NOT carried out the value system that Enron promotes  and I'm sure whoever sent the comment about redeployment in that meeting  had every meaning of HR person representing Enron in such a  way that ""a joke"" is a kind way of putting it. No one should be  treated this way.   On July 31, 2001, I took a   temporary position in the Associate & Analyst Program headed by Billy  Lemmons and Traci Warner working with Jeff Davis, John Walt and Cathy Lira as  well as supporting the group as a whole.  I worked in this department  until  August 21, 2001.  I received a message from Shirley Cox,  Sheila Walton's assistant inquiring whether or not I had a  position within Enron.  I called Shirley back and gave  her information about the temporary assignment I had taken in the Associate  & Analysts Program. On  August 14th, a call was made by Sheila  Walton to a Sr. Admin in the Associate & Analyst Program,  inquiring whether I was working this department.  The admin passed the  information to Jeff Davis and he contacted Sheila Walton as to where I was  working and how long I had been working in the department.  With a  remorseful sounding voice, Sheila proceeded to inquiry to Jeff more details, to  which Jeff provided her.  I had overtime hours that I tried to put into the  system, but I was unable to get into the time system.  After the  conversation with Jeff Davis and Sheila Walton, I  find  out Sheila  had started the process to delete me from the system,  before my original end date of August  15th.   I accepted a permanent position with Enron Networks as a Admin  Assistant II on August 14, 2001 reporting to Sam Leuschen.  I started  that position on August 22, 2001. On August 24, 2001, after 2 days  of employment was terminated from the position and Enron due to  Business Reorganization in Enron Networks.  
 
    I am very concerned about the  way this matter was handled and the series of events that surrounded this  action.  As a result,  I would like to discuss with you and or  someone in the responsible capacity and go into further detail.   I have received a form letter stating that Enron can terminate my employment at  will, at any time and for any reason.  I feel this action has been provoked  for other reasons. 
 
     In ending this message to  you, Mr. Lay, you must know that redeployment at Enron is  a effective tool that should remain in place.  You should also know and  commend those persons who work in and closely with the redeployment group.   Enough good things cannot not be said about those people who go  out of their way to get you the help, the encouragement, the tools you need  while facing this process.  I realize that a business  decision was made, and EBS downfall was a business decision, but this matter is  not a business one.  When redeployment takes place, the human side of you  feel somewhat lost, hurt and you take it personally,although I realize it  was a business decision.  This occurrence was targeted and directed at  me personally by Sheila Walton. Human resources should work with the human  being to make you a better person through visions and values, not to be treated  inhumanely.  Whether they are Enron's values or values in  general, HR representatives should portray what human  beings should have most of all...VALUES, and  when there is no communication, no respect, no integrity, ""the  joke"" begins and excellence is lost..
 
    I look forward to hearing from  you or someone in your office soon.   I can be contacted at the  numbers listed below at any time.   Thank you in advance for the  opportunity to discuss this matter.
 
 
 
Sincerely,

To Whom It May Concern:

Through TV and newspapers , I hear constantly about identity fraud using stolen social security information.    I am very concerned about this issue.

I have the following suggestion for our company.  Since Enron's employees are assigned an SAP identification numbers (P number) and an HR number, could Enron as a company use these IDs instead of the SS numbers?  This will be safer for all employees.

For example, I am concerned when I buy the monthly bus passes and I have to fill in my SS number.  I do not feel secure at all to see my SS in so many databases at Enron, especially when some databases are from third-parties (out-sourcing).  We could use our badge number there instead of our SS.

Please let me know how your organization can help the Enron employees feel safer about the safeguard of their SS number.

Michelle--
This is from Gloria (at my spouseperson's laptop).  Attached below is my mark-up of the HR agreement sent to you earlier in the day by Lara.  A few comments:
*	I am willing to confine employment offers under 2.01(a) to ""then available"" jobs, so long as you are willing to confine the exclusion to folks on LTD.
*	I changed sick ""leave"" in the ""vacation and sick leave"" section to sick ""pay,"" since we don't have sick days and I didn't want to confuse FMLA-- which, as I know you know, is not transferable between employers.
*	The language at 2.15(c) is essentially yours (which had gotten deleted), plus an additional clause in light of 2.01(a).
*	I added section 2.01(d) in light of the decisions regarding Simon Davies and John Reed, whose names will be deleted from Schedule B.
I will be in a meeting out of the office tomorrow a.m., but Lara knows how to reach me and I can be interrupted if you want to discuss any of this further.  I understand we're trying to get this stuff signed up tomorrow afternoon, so we should probably discuss as early in the day as we can.

If so, then it would be nice for there to be some rough correlation to compensation.  If not, then what are the criteria for determining the bonus amounts?  If it is P&L and some other components, then let's specify what they are.  My biggest concern with all of this flexibility is that decisions will appear arbitrary with no clear basis for distinguishing between persons at the top of the bonus range and persons in the bottom.
 
On non-commercial, will there be a further breakdown within the 80?  If so, will those correlate to bonus amounts?  If not, same question as above.
 
I understand that market forces may drive many of these bonus decisions.  If so, then I believe that we simply should articulate them and be prepared to explain the bases for bonus payment amounts.
 
Promotion process looks good.
 
Assistants and clerks looks good, although it looks like OOC will decide bonus amounts.  If this is a fixed amount based on the rating, then that is ok.  Otherwise, if they are not pretty standardized, the same issues arise as above.  I
 
I expect that the same kinds of questions will arise for all business unit plans.
 
Hope this helps.  Let me know if you want to discuss or would like to talk through pay criteria.
 
Michelle

Here is our plan on PRC. 

Assistants: 

Ranked 1,2,3 by supervisors - pay determined by Me and Louise.  No meetings. 

Non Commercial but in North America: 

Traditional ranking with the correct people addending the meetings.  Pay grid determined by OOC. 

Analysts and Associates 

Ranked as per Billy Lemmons %'s and then pay grid determined by OOC 
I would like to see 25% - 65% - 10%.  Billy disagrees.  This would provide for a quick meeting rather than trying to split them into 4 groups with the top one excluding some awesome people.

Managers/Directors 

Ranked from 1 to 100 in as many clusters as the groups see fit.  We are going to combine managers and directors into one table.  The ranking is based on this years performance is directly related to pay.  We will have two meetingss - one for traders and one for other commercial staff (orig/finance/etc).  We will not have a pay prc but will take the results of the rankings and work with individual leaders after the meetings to ensure the appropriate compensation.

We will also determine promotions during this meeting using different criteria. 

VP's 

We will rank all our VP's from 1 to 100 with a group of selected people - some VP's and some MD's.  
This too will be directly related to pay. 

Cheers as you Brits say

Michelle,

Here's the list of information I need for Northern Natural Gas:

1.  EEOC charges, lawsuits and/or judgments entered or settlement agreements reached in the last 2 years (including discrimination, harassment, workers' comp and ERISA claims, or otherwise), including any compliance agreements, consent decrees, etc. with any governmental agency (i.e..  OFCCP, EEOC, DOL, etc.)

2.  List of any pending government compliance audits, administrative proceedings, employee grievances regarding compliance with wage, overtime, or safety and health issues.

I talked with Valeria and she is pulling the EEOC charge information.  Of course, I need this as soon as possible.  Thanks for your help.

Ann

"RE: Risk Analysis","I think this looks good.  For simplicity, I would use the ethnic codes we have in datamart/sap rather than creating new ones. That makes it easier to populate.  One other field to add would be visa status.  
 
As with the other documents, I believe that the population of these documents can be done now, with just the blank for ""yes"" or ""no"" for layoff waiting for the rest of the process.  You probably will have to run these by the generalist, Valeria or someone in ER team, and the attorneys for the special risk factors column.
 
Be sure and mark this document as privileged and confidential, prepared at the direction of counsel, so that we can protect the privilege of this document if necessary.
 
Thanks.

I took a shot at combining the two spreadsheets.  Michelle, please provide correct ethic codes (I just guessed).  Tana, I'll need some help formatting the ""Yrs. of Svc."" and ""Age"" columns to calculate after we input date of hire and date of birth.  Comments?
 
Thanks,

"RE: System Preparation - Vacation accrual methodology","Given that this has not been communciated to current employees, I believe that we should consider whether we want to continue this strategy at this time.

Subject:	System Preparation - Vacation accrual methodology
Importance:	High

David, could you please confirm the system capabilities and preparation as it pertain to the changes in Enron's vacation accrual process.  Under the policy revision, vacation accruals will be 1/12th. of employees annual allotment, applied on the last day of each month, effective January 2002.  Jo Ann Hill had assumed the lead in getting this issue addressed.  She is not available to confirm preparations.
Before we communicate this change to those employees covered by Enron's US domestic HR / SAP payroll policies,  We should be certain the system is prepared.   
Please confirm that the system will not credit an annual allocation to employee vacation balance on January 1, 2002, and;
Please confirm that the system will credit vacation time balances with 1/12 of the annual allocation on the last date of each month, beginning January 31, 2002  

Thanks for your prompt attention to this matter,
Regards, Rj.
