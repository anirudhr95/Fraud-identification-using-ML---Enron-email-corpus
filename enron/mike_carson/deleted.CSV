"**IMPORTANT** Stack Manager Users","
We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

"DTMI: TOP STOCK PICK              152662","Our last pick, SYGE has returned more than 30% since December 19th. Today's company
looks like an even bigger winner.

***********************************************************************
OTC Investor
Dtomi, Inc. (OTC.BB: DTMI)
January 09, 2002
***********************************************************************

The Bear Market appears to have ended and the market has tested important support levels. Recently the NASDAQ has rallied to over 2000, and the DOW has rallied to over 10,000. The accumulation/distribution indicators have turned extremely positive, meaning institutions and mutual funds have started buying stocks. We believe it is time for investors to get back into the market. Our next recommendation, Dtomi, Inc. (OTC.BB:DTMI), could be one of our top picks of the year. For this reason we here are giving DTMI our highest rating of Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth.

**********************************************************************

About the Company

DTMI is a technology company that turns data into market intelligence. DTMI combines very sophisticated proprietary software that intelligently researches every aspect of business to business databases for company information, products and manufacturing capacity. DTMI utilizes these proprietary databases to create algorithms that compile and sell high-demand corporate intelligence and marketing information. DTMI's combination of technology and expertise quickly identifies new markets and prospects for client's marketing departments. According to DTMI's management, the company has become one of the leading aggregator and distributors of data from disparate corporate sources. This data is melded into a collective, powerful, interlocking matrix of valuable and concise information. Using DTMI's Market Intelligence Tools, a client-company can compile a comprehensive market report (including total market valuation), pinpoint each unique segment within that market, determine the va!
luation and number of companies that make up that segment, then identify actual buyers of its products. Simply put, the value of DTMI to a client-company is this: the comprehensive analysis that DTMI compiles for its clients is usually done in one day or less and costs on average $5000 to $7000. Using a company's own marketing and research department to compile the same information, and generate similiar quality leads, would take weeks or months and cost tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Revised Earnings

In today's economic climate of layoffs and cost-cutting, companies are looking for ways to save money. DTMI offers a service they cannot afford to pass up. DTMI management is seeing such a rapid acceleration in the number of companies coming to it for services, it has recently revised earnings projections upward. Also, DTMI is signing up clients with longer-term engagements than management had originally projected. This is just one of the reasons we are strongly recommending this stock.

Market Place

Sales of Business Information are expected to reach $58 Billion by 2003 according to Verronis & Suhler. DTMI's market intelligence segment is expected to reach $4 billion in the next several years. As we stated earlier, DTMI's technology can yield detailed market intelligence in a matter of minutes, compared to weeks or more to cultivate the similar data through traditional means, and at an incredible savings. We believe DTMI's technology is far above its competitors, and that it can capture a huge share of its market.

Conclusion

We believe market penetration of 1.5-2% is very achievable for DTMI. That could potentially mean an estimated $80 million-plus in revenues per year. Should the company achieve even half those revenues, our target price will be raised significantly. At $40 million in revenues, and with a 30% net margin, earnings would be $12 million. After-tax income would be $0.54 per share. At a 20 P/E ratio the stock would be worth $10.80 per share; but remember, that's half of what we think it could achieve. Also, according to management, based on early feedback from customers, new business will not be a problem. You can see why we are excited about this stock. Additionally, this company just started trading at $1.70 and, based on the company's quick move out of the blocks, Wall Street is paying attention. At these current price levels the stock is difficult for us to ignore. It looks like DTMI is in a strong upward trend, climbing to higher levels.

Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to po! st! solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Kens Killers Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Kens Killers Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move. !   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Powers Rangers Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Woltys Won! de! rs Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/16/01 Walls has be! en! held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Commissioner Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/16/01 Schro! ed! er (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues.

"Re: TRADE","
Alright, dammit...
 
I forkin told everyone that it was first come,  first served.
The ONLY reason that you should copy everyone via  email
is out of  courtesy so they know the player is off the free agent
list until I make the actual trade because,  A.) I can't do the
deal until Tuesday morning anyway, and B.) it makes  other
team members aware of the trade.
 
Protocol, people.

Thursday Morning session----Meeting with State Commissioners


This session was generally known to be the occasion for state commissioners to vent their frustrations at FERC taking action without including them in the decision making process.  Although the panel notice showed that 5 state commissioners would attend, upon arriving in the hearing room we found that 27 state commissioners were there and ready to claim their 15 minutes of fame.  It was a long morning!  I will include comments or highlights from some of the commissioners below as well as some general thoughts. 

Approximately 35 to 40% of the commenters were supportive of FERC and urged them to keep moving forward with their efforts.  Most of these comments came from the Midwest and were somewhat muted or rational in their support.  Everyone else was fairly verbal against FERC, primarily citing that fact that they had been left out of the process, that FERC was moving too quickly, and there was no evidence that there was a benefit to their citizens.  In particular, the commissioners from Maryland and North Carolina delivered highly charged rhetoric. While many would think that the session was extremely negative (our friend Sarah Novosel thought it was disgusting!) in my mind it was similiar to a legislative hearing--allowing alot of whining and then addressing the main themes of discontent such as performing a cost benefit analysis.

Here's some individual comments:

Catherine Riley/Maryland---she started out talking about the fact that she had taken a solemn oath to uphold the constitution when she joined the MAryland commission and immediately implied that FERC was not as diligent or honest as she was in upholding the values of protecting citizens (she was way overboard in the dramatics department).  She then stated that she was not at the meeting to ""help you (FERC) backfill your woefully inadequate evidentiary record"".  It went on like this for about 15 minutes.  The good part is that she was so personally negative, that her comments will not only be discounted but may be used against her.

Sam Ervin/NOrth Carolina---he was also very negative and he does not believe that there are any benefits to his citizens, that customer choice is never coming to his state, so he will never benefit from an RTO, that his current statutes do not allow any transfer of transmission to an RTO (and I bet if they do, he'll work to change the statutes!) and that the bulk of state commissions are not supportive of FERC. His comments were also pretty brutal, but sugar coated just a bit with southern humor.

Arnetta McRae/Delware---she kept on saying ""show me"" where the benefits for consumers are.  She also repeatedly talked about how short of a time frame they had to respond to the order.  

Rory McMinn/New Mexico---repeatedly talked about how the west was different, how he is not convinced that there is a benefit to his consumers, how the FERC commissioners needed to come out west to see how different they were. 

Carl Wood/California--tried to portray himself and California as representing the west as a whole, and even brought along a statement from the Washington commission echoeing his comments. He delivered the same messages that we've been hearing forever---FERC should have acted sooner on price caps, etc etc.

Glen Thomas/Pennsylvania---he was the first positive commenter and talked about how his state has taken great strides to bring it's energy system into the new century...that by opening it's markets they have had an explosion in green power, they have reduced costs all across the state, etc. He was very supportive of PJM (makes sense because it's in his back yard) and stated that for any RTO to be effective it must have independent governance.  

Judy Jones/Ohio---was very parochial in her discussion, but echoed Don Svanda's comments from earlier in the week that one RTO for the midwest was necessary and encouraged the FERC to make a decision and get on with it so that regulatory uncertainty would be removed.

Ed GArvey/Minnesota---he got the gold star for the day.  After very very lengthly comments from about 15 commissioners, he took about 1 minute and said ""FERC--just get it done""....in essence telling them to go ahead with what they are doing and move forward.

Other Commissioners who talked were:  Arthur/Connecticut, Hadley/Indiana, Huelsman/Kentucky, Nugent/ Maine  all on the positive side.  Other negative commentors were two guys from DC and Jim Irvin from Arizona who had a rambling conversation that never really pinpointed what he wanted to do.


From the FERC commissioner standpoint, the gold star went to Massey.  After hearing over and over again about how the commisioners didn't feel that they had been included and that FERC had not consulted them enough, he stated that he was going to express his frustration right back, saying the ""there has been 7 years of process, and he wants a process that comes to an end....you've been talking for 7 years and never could agree...""


Call me if I can provide any further insights into the individual comments or the tenor of the meeting.  Sue.  #612-339-4599

  Opening comments from Head Coach Jim Wooldridge...
""Practice is underway. We've practiced four days, and we feel good about those days. We like the way our kids are competing, we've improved our ball club, but in a sense, I guess that all remains to be seen. We're walking into this year optimistic about improving, and that will be our approach.""

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle again! st! a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Commissioner Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/21/01Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Damons Doormats Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01  There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he ha! s ! been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/21/0!  The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.  Stephen Alexander  , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 According to the Washington Post, Alexander will be back in the starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a gamble.   Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't recommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this is the game he will break his slump.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/21/01 Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/21/01 McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore, and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for explosive stats.  Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/21/01 Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes than most receivers in the league.  Elvis Joseph , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this week if you have no other options at running ! ba! ck.  Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However, you should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday against San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way and post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent. However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer downfield for great stats this week.  Dominic Rhodes , RB IND - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats, but should give good rushing totals and a score.  Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Clark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in recent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend these two tight ends, if you need to start one it should definitely be Clark.  More Updates   Teams, Player News  [IMAGE]Carsons Wildcats Player News  Mark Brunell , Reserve QB Updated 11/21/01 Brunell's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.  Ahman Green , Active RB Updated 11/21/01 Green had a huge game against Detroit back in Week One, rushing for 157 yards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 against those same Lions, whose defense is questionable at best.   Kurt Warner , Active QB Updated 11/21/01 Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401 yards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and will throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent secondary.   Shannon Sharpe , Active TE Updated 11/21/01 Sharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving touchdown on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced Jacksonville, and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe into your active lineup every week.  Torry Holt , Active WR Updated 11/21/01 Holt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last weekend against New England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   David Patten , Active WR Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Rod Gardner , Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01 Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.   Michael Pittman , Reserve RB Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  Freddie Jones , Reserve TE Updated 11/18/01 Jones (ankle) has been declared inactive for Sunday's game. He has been advised not to play for two weeks.  LaDainian Tomlinson , Active RB Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason.   Matt Stover , Active K Updated 10/25/01 Stover has a minor leg injury that will prevent him from kicking off but he will be able to kick field goals, according to published reports. The injury isn't considered serious but the Ravens are considering Steve Lindsey and Jaret Holmes as candidates to handle kickoffs.   Steve Christie , Reserve K Updated 09/11/01 According to published reports, Christie has been released by the Buffalo Bills. Christie, who was placed on injured reserve due to a groin injury last week, will have an MRI on Tuesday. Drop Christie now if you haven't already done so, and consider picking up Jake Arians, who has taken over the placekicking duties in Buffalo.   Travis Prentice , Reserve RB Updated 09/03/01 Prentice was traded to the Vikings, where he might see some work as a No. 2 RB, at best. He's not worth a Fantasy draft choice right now.   Rams , Active DT Updated 08/30/01 Head Coach Mike Martz announced that safeties Kim Herring (hamstring) and Adam Archuleta (hamstring), linebackers Mark Fields (thigh) and London Fletcher (hamstring) and CB Aeneas Williams (back) will be held out of the Rams' final preseason game. However, they will all be ready for the season opener against Philadelphia on September 9. The Rams defense is worth a late-round selection on Draft Day.   Steelers , Reserve DT Updated 08/25/01 Defensive back Chad Scott sprained the medial collateral ligament in his right knee on Saturday. He is expected to have an MRI this weekend, and the team is uncertain of just how long he'll be out.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Michael,  On Wednesday, we'll continue our live coverage of the 18th World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will bring us reports and interviews throughout the day.   Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says they'll continue to bring us the very latest on energy legislation and how it's progressing. The bureau will also have updates on the anthrax scare in Washington.  Congressional office buildings were closed on Tuesday, but there's a possibility some could reopen as soon as Wednesday.   The Washington bureau will also cover Wednesday's FERC meeting as commissioners meet for the first time since the end of the weeklong workshop on Regional Transmission Organizations.  Peter says new proposals for developing RTOs in the Northeast and Southeast are among the issues on the FERC's agenda.   Dyonyx CEO Fred Pratt will talk with the Houston bureau about how companies can make current technologies work better for them. Dyonyx is a privately held information technology and management-consulting firm.  Join us for the Pratt interview from the Houston bureau on Wednesday.   We'll also get a Texas PUC update on Wednesday.  ENL's Gale Smith says we'll find out what electric providers are doing to increase security and what the Texas PUC is doing to monitor emergency preparedness in Texas.  Be sure to catch all this from the Houston bureau tomorrow.   California Power Authority Chairman S. David Freeman gives a reflective look back at the state's energy crunch from the West Coast bureau Wednesday.  Freeman also talks about how the state plans to stay out of the headlines in the future.   West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station will go ahead with plans to set off its 49 sirens on Wednesday to make sure warning systems are operational.  Kym says they will continue the test despite their concerns of a jittery public in light of recent terrorist attacks.   Video Library Update: If you happened to miss it, check out ENL's interview with Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM).  Sen. Bingaman discussed the status of energy legislation in the Senate and the anthrax threat in Washington.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/23/01 Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Gramatica is expected to play on December 29.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith  , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden  , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.  Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner  , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.

  [IMAGE] October 20, 2001 [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] Volume IV, Issue 91 [IMAGE]     Email : info@otcjournal.com   URL : http://www.otcjournal.com    To OTC Journal Members:      [IMAGE] Special Announcement     When I look back on all these worries I remember the story of the old man who said on his deathbed that he had had a lot of trouble in his life, most of which never happened. Sir Winston Churchill from Their Finest Hour  We are working on a very special edition custom tailored for bargain hunters. The last three weeks have led investors to believe there are other directions stocks can go besides straight down.   There are many technology stocks trading at less than 1% of their previous highs. Stocks are so low the NASDAQ has suspended its minimum $1 bid rule for the remainder of the year and has announced it will review the rule early next year.   Unlike most market environments, individual investors have a competitive advantage over fund managers with stocks at these levels. Most fund managers have thresholds below which they are not allowed to hold stocks. Many funds cannot hold stocks below $5, and others have a $1 threshold. Fund managers have been forced to sell stocks at these levels in order to comply with the rules of their fund, oftentimes against their personal wishes and their own common sense. Fund managers will be able to purchase these stocks again once they appreciate above $1 and $5.   We are working on a list of stocks with compelling values that are very oversold. In order to make the list, the stock must be trading below the cash value the company has per share, and have little or no debt. We will try to publish this exciting edition next weekend. We might call it the ""Riskless Rebound"" edition. Stayed tuned.     [IMAGE] Energy Power Systems (OTC BB: EYPSF) Updated Profile [IMAGE]  Followers of Energy Power know it has been trading up and down the charts over the last 2 weeks. We are suggesting the company change its symbol to OTIS as the stock goes up and down like an Otis Elevator.   For investors looking for more information on Energy Power, the editors of the OTC Journal have updated our original profile to reflect changing corporate events subsequent to the original release on February 12th.   Click Here  to review the updated profile. If you never read our original release this would be an excellent opportunity to familiarize yourself with this company.     [IMAGE] Envoy Communications (NASDAQ: ECGI) Update [IMAGE]  Our inbox is filled with questions on Envoy as the stocks fades into the oblivion of the $1 range. The stock is behaving as if there is something wrong with the company.   We spoke with management briefly this week about this issue. At the corporate level nothing has changed. Fiscal 2001, which ended at the end of September, still looks like roughly $10 million CDN in EBITDA profits. As of right now, business for fiscal 2002 looks about the same as 2001. The stock is trading at about 3 times 2002 EBITDA. The industry average is currently 11 times 2002 EBITDA.   What's the explanation for this pathetic performance? Simple- management is doing nothing at this time to market their company to investors. Their only audience is the members of the OTC Journal.   A plan for a nationwide institutional road show was in place prior to Attack on America, but that is now on hold. We can only hope management will wake up and recognize their responsibility to shareholders and get proactive in telling their story.    Tax selling could hurt this stock, so it could go lower. One can only hope that despite management's failure to get out and tell their story, someone will come along and recognize the inherent value in this company.   Bottom line- Not worth selling at this price, but it could go lower.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Michael,  President Bush delivers his State of the Union address Tuesday evening, and on Wednesday our Washington bureau will bring us complete coverage of the speech as it relates to energy.  During his address, the President will likely discuss the pending debate in the U.S. Senate over comprehensive energy legislation.  President Bush is not expected to mention Enron by name, but he's expected to touch on some of the issues raised by the company's bankruptcy.   There's a regular Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meeting on Wednesday.  There are a host of issues on the agenda including the Commission's new push to address market power and the California case.   Finally from Washington, in the wake of the Enron implosion, there's talk of a new lobbying effort on behalf of electricity restructuring.  Former FERC Chairman James Hoecker is spearheading the effort and will talk with us during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow about where those efforts stand.   Altira Managing Partner Dirk McDermott talks about challenges new energy companies face when trying to find investors, especially since the Enron crisis.  On Wednesday in the Houston bureau, we'll hear from McDermott and have details on his speech from Energy Venture Fair II, where he addressed the issue.   Also from Houston, AES New Energy President Clem Palevich talks about the challenges his company faces in the new Texas electric deregulated market in Texas.     Bonneville Power Administration Spokesperson Mike Hansen will join West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast on Wednesday.   Hansen will discuss how lower market prices will lead to higher rates in the Northwest.      More on energy prices - from New York on Wednesday, Merrill Lynch Senior Economist Gerald Cohen will discuss the impact of energy prices on the economy.  He'll also give us his expectations for the Fed.  Catch Cohen during the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow.    Closing Prices for Tuesday, Jan. 29, 2002    Crude: $19.58/bbl -$0.47   Unleaded: $0.5669/gallon -$0.0142   Heating Oil: $0.5205/gallon -$0.0108   Gas: $2.006/mmBtu +$0.098   Fwd uE(Feb.): $3.39/mmBtu +$0.03   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to reschedule or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

 Attention Fantasy Players! Cant find that perfect gift? Let MVP.com make it easy for you! Save 10% on your next purchase when you purchase a Gift Certificate from now until 12/27/01. Click Here for Details .     Brought to you by   Sponsorship Bar You are receiving these e-reports because you have signed up for CBS SportsLine.com Fantasy Football.  To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/25/01 Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. However, he may be able to return to the Steelers' starting lineup. Bill Cowher said Bettis is progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy.   James Stewart , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01  Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/23/01 Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Gramatica is expected to play on December 29.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair  , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.  Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook  , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabi! li! tate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter, WR MIN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Kens Killers Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Kens Killers Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens K! il! lers Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team! b! ased on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Powers Rangers Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 11/16/01 Favre has be! en! one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Commissioner Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Michael,  The Department of Energy is hosting a conference on Clean Coal Technology on Monday in Washington.  The conference will take a look at where coal-fired generation could be headed in the future.  U.S. Energy Association Chairman John Derrick, the Chairman and CEO of Pepco, is among those scheduled to speak.   Look for energy legislation to move to the forefront when lawmakers return from Thanksgiving break.  Republicans in the Senate say they want to take action on energy legislation in December, while Democrats aren't as sure of the time frame. Next week, the Washington bureau will bring us an update on where legislation stands and what the chances are that we'll see a comprehensive energy bill before the end of the year.   The North American Electric Reliability Council will release its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment on Tuesday; our Washington bureau will bring us coverage.   If MTBE is banned, the gasoline industry will have to drastically increase production of ethanol.  On Monday, the Houston bureau's  Gale Smith will have a report on some companies looking at alternative ways of making ethanol.  We'll find out which products have a chance at becoming a substitute for MTBE.   A recent poll taken by Deloitte & Touche says power deregulation in Texas won't mean an immediate rate reduction for consumers.  The Houston bureau will have more from Deloitte & Touche's Branko Terzic on Monday.   ENL's Kym McNicholas reports the California Power Authority is meeting over the weekend to discuss the scope and direction of its Energy Resource Investment Plan.  The plan is due to the legislature and to the governor by February 15, 2002.  Kym will bring us the latest on Monday from the weekend meeting.   Also on Monday, the California Energy Commission will hear a petition for reconsideration of its decision on Calpine's proposed Metcalf Energy Center.  After the meeting we'll have comments from the counsel to the petitioners Stephan Volker.    Jolen Operating Company President David Fleischaker will speak with us from Oklahoma City on Monday.  He'll give us a status check of energy legislation and discuss what he feels is the real problem behind Enron.  We'll hear from Fleischaker during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast.   From Dallas on Monday, RBC Capital Markets Director  Mark Easterbrook is joining us.  Easterbrook will talk about the performance and outlook for Master Limited Partnerships in the energy industry and which investors are suited to buy MLPs.  Catch him during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast.   Broadcasting Note: I just want to give you a heads up on the schedule for next week.  ENL will be dark on Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgiving market holiday.     Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. Have a wonderful and relaxing weekend!   Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

Follow the prompts closely to ensure a smooth setup.
 
On the first screen, titled Welcome to MSN Messenger Service!, click Next ->

To add a person to your contact list, click the Add button. For general help, questions, or to learn the new emoticons ( Telephone receiver <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/data/messengerv36_1.its51/$content$/emphone.gif>,  Boy <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/data/messengerv36_1.its51/$content$/emboy.gif>,  Thumbs up <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/data/messengerv36_1.its51/$content$/thumbu.gif>, etc.) For direct access to this link, click here <http://help.microsoft.com/EN_US/HelpWindow_msg.asp?Topic=InfoTech.asp&INI=msgv35.ini&SearchTerm=ffogol&S_Text=signing+in&H_APP=MSN%20Messenger%20Service&BrandID=MSMSGS&Filter=msgrxchg>.

He will probably not be used enough, however, to help most Fantasy teams.   Derrick Mason , WR TEN - Kens Killers Updated 12/19/01 Mason missed Tuesday's practice with a hip flexor injury. His current status is day to day.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/19/01 McNair (back stiffness) missed practice on Tuesday. His current status is day to day.   Chris Sanders , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Sanders has returned to practice from a back injury. He is not expected to play this week.   Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Richardson is day to day with a shoulder injury. He is expected to play on Sunday.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/19/01 Gadsden missed Tuesday's practice with a strained hamstring. He is expected to play on Saturday.  Bill Gramatica , K ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/19/01 Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will be Arizona's placekicker for the final three games of the season.   Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/19/01 Zereoue is listed as questionable this week because of a sore shoulder.  He might start at RB if healthy. He replaced Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala and gained 73 yards Sunday.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/19/01 The Pittsburgh Steelers may be without Bettis for at least one more week. Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a groin injury. ""But this is not a Fred Taylor injury. He (Bettis) will come back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playing in the right games."" Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start for Bettis.  Skip Hicks , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher said Monday that he plans to give Hicks more work over the final three games of the season, according to the Nashville Tennessean . ""We're going to play Skip more,"" Fisher said. ""We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's production over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/18/01 McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.  Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Zereoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimore. His status for next Sunday's game against Detroit is unclear, but he's only a marginal starter in deeper leagues anyway.  Gus Frerotte , QB DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery. Brian Griese will probably start for the remainder of the season, with Jarious Jackson serving as his backup.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Damons Doormats Updated 12/18/01 According to the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Jackson could miss the remainder of the season due to a sprained ankle. He wasn't a reliable weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the way if Jackson is out.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/18/01 Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Baltimore. Don't reserve him based on this injury, and only consider benching him based on the Ravens' strong rush defense.  Scott Mitchell , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Mitchell could get the start Sunday against Baltimore due to Jon Kitna's strained ligament in the middle finger of his throwing hand. Whether Mitchell or Kitna gets the call, we don't expect either QB to be worth starting in the most important weeks of the Fantasy season.  Akili Smith  , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he recovered from a hand inj! ur! y. None of the three is a worthy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Powers Rangers Updated 12/18/01 Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/18/01 Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle. He is no worse than questionable for Sunday's game against San Diego at this point, but keep an eye on his status before you consider using him this week.  Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Emanuel (knee) could be back in the starting lineup this week against Pittsburgh. He will be re-evaluated this week to determine his true status for the game.   Santana Moss , WR NYJ - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/18/01 Moss, still suffering from a strained quadriceps is listed as questionable for Sunday's game. The injury has sidelined him the past few weeks.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 12/18/01 Davis suffered a knee injury during Sunday's loss to Philadelphia. ""He's sore today, but he has indicated he'll be fine,"" Coach Marty Schottenheimer told the Washington Post. Despite the injury, Davis is expected to start against Chicago in Week 15.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 According to the Washington Post, Banks will remain the Redskins' starting quarterback. Banks has been very inconsistent recently, but Coach Marty Schottemheimer is expected to stick with him rather than go with backup Kent Graham.   Frank Murphy , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 12/18/01 Murphy suffered a severely sprained ankle during Sunday's loss to Chicago. The injury will likely keep him out of this weekend's game against New Orleans.   More Updates  Teams, Player News  [IMAGE]Carsons Wildcats Player News  Bill Gramatica , Reserve K Updated 12/19/01 Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will be Arizona's placekicker for the final three games of the season.   Ahman Green , Active RB Updated 12/16/01 Green had an awful outing at Tennessee, finishing with just nine rushing yards and 24 receiving yards. Expect him to quickly rebound from such a poor performance.   LaDainian Tomlinson , Active RB Updated 12/16/01 Tomlinson had only 69 all-purpose yards on Saturday against Oakland. He seems to be wearing down somewhat, which makes him more and more of a risk for Fantasy owners.   Kurt Warner , Active QB Updated 12/14/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success this week. Expect fine numbers from him against the NFC West rival Saints on Monday Night Football.   Torry Holt , Active WR Updated 12/14/01 The explosive Holt is a must-start player in Week 14. He will be a regularly featured target for Kurt Warner on Monday Night Football.   David Patten , Active WR Updated 12/14/01 Patten hasn't been a very good Fantasy receiver recently. His numbers may suffer now that Terry Glenn has returned.   Freddie Jones , Reserve TE Updated 12/14/01 Jones has been a Fantasy disappointment again this year. He won't do much against Oakland on Saturday.  Rod Gardner , Active WR Updated 12/14/01 Gardner has been a servicable Fantasy player this year, but don't count on him to find the end zone against the tough Philadelphia secondary this week.   Mark Brunell , Reserve QB Updated 12/13/01 Brunell did not practice Wednesday but will play Sunday, according to the Florida Times-Union. He is expected to practice on Thursday. Brunell is recovering from a lingering quadriceps injury and an injured finger.  Shannon Sharpe , Reserve TE Updated 12/13/01 Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play Sunday. He practiced Wednesday and is listed as probable on the injury report.   Steve Christie , Active K Updated 12/12/01 Christie will continue to work on field goals. Both he and Wade Richey, who is working on kickoffs, are not reliable Fantasy kickers.  Michael Pittman , Reserve RB Updated 12/02/01 Pittman had a solid game, posting 93 all-purpose yards and a touchdown against Oakland. He's been inconsistent as a Fantasy player, however, and is best used when the matchup is right.  Travis Prentice , Reserve RB Updated 09/03/01 Prentice was traded to the Vikings, where he might see some work as a No. 2 RB, at best. He's not worth a Fantasy draft choice right now.   Rams , Active DT Updated 08/30/01 Head Coach Mike Martz announced that safeties Kim Herring (hamstring) and Adam Archuleta (hamstring), linebackers Mark Fields (thigh) and London Fletcher (hamstring) and CB Aeneas Williams (back) will be held out of the Rams' final preseason game. However, they will all be ready for the season opener against Philadelphia on September 9. The Rams defense is worth a late-round selection on Draft Day.   Steelers , Reserve DT Updated 08/25/01 Defensive back Chad Scott sprained the medial collateral ligament in his right knee on Saturday. He is expected to have an MRI this weekend, and the team is uncertain of just how long he'll be out.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

  [IMAGE] December 29, 2001 [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] Volume IV, Issue 110 [IMAGE]     Email : info@otcjournal.com   URL : http://www.otcjournal.com    To OTC Journal Members:      [IMAGE] Upcoming Trading Alert- Leading off the New Year   We're starting off the New Year with a Trading Alert  next Friday, January 4th.

In the late 90's Wall Street's enormous appetite for technology IPOs created an excess supply of technology in this sector, most of which becomes obsolete sooner than companies can get it to customers.   The shrinking economy forced a significant contraction of IT budgets at large corporations, and the market for XML Global's products vaporized temporarily. XML is a new universal computer language which allows large systems to communicate directly with each other. Analysts have long recognized this new language will eventually dominate the B to B space. Most importantly- the implementation of this language saves companies money over the long run, making its adoption inevitable.   However, after having survived a challenging environment, business seems to be turning the corner at XML Global. This small company has garnered an unusual amount of high profile publicity on its products. The December 24th edition of Business Week carried a feature on the company's stolen property tracking software, Xtract. Click Here  to read the article. If you have a copy of the magazine, the article can be found on page 75.   The stock dropped all the way from $1 to just under $.20, but has since come off the canvas and tripled. Expect the company to continue to announce more positive fundamental developments in the first quarter of 2002 as the long awaited XML revolution finally begins to take hold.     [IMAGE] MedGrup (OTC BB: CODX) Year End Update [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  MedGrup provides outsourced coding services for hospitals. Their business evolved out of the medicare related fraudulent practices of health care providers in the late 1980's and early 1990's.   We have always liked this company as they have been consistently profitable and nearly doubled in size every year for the past three years.   The company embarked on an aggressive expansion plan in the first quarter, gearing up staff to handle a significant increase in business from a large, Houston based hospital chain.   Towards the end of the summer the expansion was derailed by serious flooding in the Houston area, which led to the closing of several hospitals. Shortly thereafter the September 11th Attack on America also slowed new contract roll outs.   New business is back on track, and the company should report a relatively strong fourth quarter. Business should accelerate next year, and the company should easily exceed the $10 million revenue mark in 2002. Overstaffing for delayed contract roll outs hurt their performance in 2001, but the delays are now in the past.   This company has a unique market niche. There is no other company which specializes in outsourced coding for hospitals. In our opinion, this company is a good candidate for a merger or acquisition of some kind in 2002, which could put the stock on the map.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Michael,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.   On Monday, International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will be live from the 18th World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  The focal theme this year is ""Energy markets: The challenges of the new millennium.""  Catch live reports from the first day of the 18th World Energy Congress on Monday.   Congress returns to Washington Monday amid continuing concern over the anthrax threat on Capitol Hill.  Both the House and Senate are expected to resume their normal schedule, which includes some action on energy.  There are hearings scheduled on the Price Anderson Act, reducing vehicle fuel consumption and MTBE.  The main action, however, will be behind the scenes in the Senate where Republicans and Democrats still differ on whether there's time to consider a comprehensive energy bill this year.  We'll bring you more details next week.    A summit on energy efficiency is also taking place next week from Washington.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D)-New Mexico and Representative  Ed Markey (D)-Massachusetts will be among the speakers at the event. We'll have all the details from the summit next week.   Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us a report Monday on Texas wind power projects.  Kim says federal and state laws helped get the idea off the ground, and now demand for wind power is allowing the market to do very well.  Kim will have all the details of wind generation success in Texas on Monday.      The Houston bureau will also have a report on how refiners will keep gasoline inventories well supplied once MTBE is phased out. Right now, MTBE makes up 10 percent of the U.S. gasoline pool.  Once the blending component is banned, refiners will look to isooctane to help supplement gasoline supplies.  Jacobs Consultancy's Dan Foley will talk about the role of isooctane on Monday.   Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz tells West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas, California's energy supply crisis is understandable, but the financial crisis is not.  Kym also talks one-on-one with former California Governor Pete Wilson.  He gives a reflective look into what went wrong with the state's deregulation plan and what the state needs to do to recover.   With earnings expected out October 31st, Calpine Corporation CEO Peter Cartwright will talk about his company's growth this quarter compared to this time last year.  He also reacts to word the state may attempt to renegotiate long-term power contracts.  We'll bring you details from the West Coast bureau on Monday.   Get the streamers and balloons ready - Energy News Live is turning one.  You'll want to be sure to log on Tuesday, October 23rd, because in celebration of ENL's one-year anniversary we've scheduled a  star-studded cast of energy industry guests.  Here's a little preview:   Former FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker, Ph.D.  Energy Daily Publisher Llewellyn King  FirstCall Director of Research Chuck Hill  Platts Global Director of Oil John Kingston  Petroleum Argus, Inc. President Dan Massey  American Association of Petroleum Geologists Director Rick Fritz   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss  , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 12/21/01  Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.   Johnnie Morton , WR DET - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2 during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams.   Amani Toomer  , WR NYG - Kens Killers Updated 12/21/01 Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during your playoffs.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/21/01 Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in the playoff race.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/21/01 Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs.    Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Powers Rangers Updated 12/21/01 Thrash was not very consistent during the regular season and may not catch a lot of TD passes in the final games of the NFL regular season. He will be a No. 2 wideout at best during the Fantasy playoffs.   David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Patten's numbers have dropped off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless your team is very thin at wide receiver.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL - Damons Doormats Updated 12/21/01 Galloway has been a disappointment for Fantasy owners this season. Unless you're in a deeper league, starting Galloway during your playoffs isn't recommended.    Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers Updated 12/21/01 Brown has been an inconsistent Fantasy receiver this year. He may not be a reliable option during the Fantasy playoffs.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/21/01 Dunn has been inconsistent this season. He will be a No. 2 back at best during your playoffs.   Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/21/01 Smith is a must-start player during the Fantasy postseason. Even if his yardage totals aren't good, he is a tremendous TD threat.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/21/01 Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your playoffs.  Anthony Becht , TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Becht hasn't been a consistent target for the Jets this year. He may not be very valuable during the Fantasy playoffs.

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

"ICMH : Breaks the Price Barrier                BF","
[IMAGE]	


   Special Alert :  ICM TELECOMMUNICATIONS   (OTCBB: ICMH)  [IMAGE]  ICM BREAKS THE PRICE BARRIER WITH UNLIMITED USAGE ON ITS FLAT - RATE CALLING CARDS    FORECASTS $83 MILLION FOR 2002  Phoenix-based ICM Telecommunications, Inc. (ICMH-NQB) has broken the price barrier, having just announced and published its unprecedented unlimited Flat Rate Program for home and business.  The industry has just gotten a major ""wake-up"" call from this little-known Arizona dynamo!    The new Flat Rate Program allows unlimited long distance calls each month within the continental United States, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.  The cost for this service, a phenomenal value, is under $45 per month.  Company management is projecting gross sales for the current year 2002 at $83 million, which will be up significantly from 2001 for ICM Telecommunications (ICMH).  Mr. Doug Hamby, CEO of ICM Telecommunications (ICMH), stated, ""We are very excited to be able to offer this kind of service.  New software and hardware technologies have come a long way in the past year, which makes it possible to provide a full service, unlimited long-distance program at these rates.  We anticipate very rapid expansion of our program as people take advantage of this money-saving service.""   In addition to Mr Hamby, Mr. Dennis Sullivan has recently joined ICM as President and COO (Chief Operating Officer).  His expertise is in creation and implementation of sales and marketing plans, as well as structuring internal operations for acquisition.  Prior to joining ICMH, Sullivan was Senior Sales & Marketing Manager for Bell South Corporation in Honolulu, Hawaii  ICM Telecommunications is a specialized telecommunications company.  ICM's newly announced, unlimited flat rate program for residential and business has an almost unlimited potential for growth.  Utilizing the new flat rate program, the company is diligently pursuing the pre-paid unlimited phone card business, and has projected significant revenues and earnings from this source.

  On playing KU, a rival school:
I would like to think, no matter who you were going to line up, that there would be a tremendous amount of motivation to become better, to have success. I think that's why we play the game, I think that's why youngsters play the game, and I think under any circumstances that they would be motivated to do so. I would hope that it would be that way. Does that make it true or not? Not necessarily, I think what you say, John, makes sense that if there is a need for additional motivation beyond what they have, maybe this traditional rival game could provide that.

His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to! s! ee some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Marty Booker , WR CHI - Kens Killers Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Carsons Wildcats Up! da! ted 11/18/01  Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Powers Rangers Upd! at! ed 11/18/01 Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every week.   Jerry Rice , WR OAK - Damons Doormats Updated 11/18/01 Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an every-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Banks w! as! carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday's game at Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graham.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 11/18/01 Favre threw for 262 yards and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play in recent weeks, Favre's potential for big games makes him a must-start every week.  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Bradford caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta. The Green Bay wideout is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Commissioner Updated 11/18/01 Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TDs and two interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Christian rushed for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green Bay. The Falcons are using him more often, and Christian makes a good backup! R! B right now.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Grbac threw for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times by the Browns. The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should not start for most Fantasy teams.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Commissioner Updated 11/18/01 Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Browns. The rookie is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give you some occasional TDs down the stretch.   Tim Couch , QB CLE - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/18/01 Couch threw for only 144 yards and was intercepted three times at Baltimore. The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even as a Fantasy backup right now.  Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Gay saw his first extensive action of the year, carrying the ball 18 times for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. He displayed good vision and lateral quickness, and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at RB.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Damons Doormats Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White shared carries in his place.   Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/18/01 Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith appears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless you lack depth at RB.  Chris Chambers , WR MIA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/18/01 The rookie wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets. Chambers is still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

  Nicole Ohlde scored 17 points as ninth-ranked
Kansas State stayed undefeated in the Big 12 with a 66-61 victory Wednesday
night over Texas A&M.  Laurie Koehn added five more 3-pointers to her NCAA-leading total from the
perimeter. But her biggest contribution came from an intentional foul that sent
her to the line in the final seconds for the Wildcats, who won their 14th
straight game.  Koehn made the second of two free throws and Kansas State got the ball back,
cooling off any chance for a comeback by the Aggies.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - Powers Rangers Updated 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in pl! ac! e of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.   Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB IND - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/18/01 Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR NE - Feeleys Fanatics Updated ! 10! /18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a ! go! od week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Chargers Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Commissioner Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats ! Updated 10/18/01 Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight ! en! d now that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Powers Rangers Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/18/01 Canida! te! will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more pr! od! uctive of the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Commissioner Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.

Subject: Alright, I've had it...
Why do all of you lazy f*cks fail to  follow
the directions below? What I am referring  to
is making a trade. The directions were as  follows:
 
1.) to make an add/drop (trade) transaction,  click on the ""Owners"" tab
on the league homepage (found up top next to Live  Chat), page down
to the bottom of the page and send a broadcast email to ALL team  members
announcing your  intentions. I will implement the trade(s) on the Tuesday  following
the Monday night game. The transaction deadline is Friday 5:00 PM for the  weekend
games. If I receive the email  timestamped before then, I will make the trade for
the upcoming weekend. IF there is a Thursday  night game, Thursday 5:00 PM
is the deadline for THE WEEKEND. At any time  after the deadline if a transaction
is submitted, it will apply to the following  weekend. Also, there will be NO limit on
the amount of transactions, feel free to  contribute as much as you wish.
 
The next jackass that submits for a  trade transaction and does NOT braodcast
it to everybody in the league will  be ignored. Gill and Farley, take note.

He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.""   Emmitt Smith! , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 10/28/01Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit.""   But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.    Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-y! ar! d run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/28/01 Jones overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - Commissioner Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price  , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/! 28! /01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Chargers Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Kens Killers Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and ! a ! TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Commissioner Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Damons Doormats Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb  , QB PHI - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Boston , WR ARI - Powers Rangers Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Commissioner Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  C! li! nt Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of ""icap"" as a product (including any ""reserve type"" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on ""Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets.""

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

Kansas State's Koehn  Named Big 12 Rookie Of The Week
Wildcats Get Fifth Rookie of the Week  Honor This Season

 
       MANHATTAN, Kan. - Kansas State freshman Laurie Koehn continues to make a  statement for Big 12 Conference Rookie of the Year honors by being named the Big  12 Conference Rookie of the Week today for the third time this  season.
       The  5-foot-8 guard from Hesston, Kan., averaged 17 points, 3.0 rebounds, 1.0  assists, 3.5 three-pointers and 37 minutes per game in victories over Kansas and  No. 12/13-ranked Texas Tech. The freshman shot 73.3 (11 of 15) percent from the  field, 77.8 (7 of 9) percent from three-point range and 71.4 (5 of 7) percent  from the foul line.
In a win over cross-state rival Kansas,  Koehn had 21 points, five rebounds, two assists and five three-pointers. The  20-plus point performance was the seventh of her career. She shot 60 percent  from the field, 71.4 percent from beyond three-point range and 66.7 percent from  the charity stripe.
 Against Texas Tech, Koehn had 13  points, a rebound, a steal and two three-pointers. She was perfect for the game  as she hit 5-for-5 from the field, 2-for-2 from three-point range and 1-for-1  from the free-throw line. With her two treys, Koehn moved into a tie for sixth  on the Big 12 single-season chart for three-pointers in a season (80). She is  tied with Megan Taylor of Iowa State  (2001).
       Koehn, who  has scored 20 or more points in seven games this season, is Kansas State's  leading scorer (18.1) and fourth in assists (53) and fourth in steals (28). She  is the team's top three-point shooter (44.9 percent) and is shooting 47.7  percent from the field and 84.6 percent from the free-throw line, while  averaging 3.8 three-pointers per game.
 Kansas State has  claimed five of the eight Big 12 Rookie of the Week honors this season with  freshman Kendra Wecker earning the honor twice. K-State has had 12 Big 12  Rookies of the Week honors since the inception of the league. Sophomore Nicole  Ohlde was honored three times last year en route to her Big 12 Freshman of the  Year honor. Koehn, who sat out last year with an injury, was named preseason Big  12 Freshman of the Year in 2000-2001.
    Kansas State, now 19-2 overall and 7-1 in the Big 12, looks to continue its  winning ways when it travels to Austin, Texas, to take on the Texas Longhorns on  Wednesday at 7 p.m.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"FW: NLR & Benton Purchase Power RFP","FYI, 



Reagan C. Rorschach


Reagan:

I wanted to confirm that you have received Mayor Hays' letter of 11/2
detailing the process we intend to follow in concluding the RFP process.  If
you have not received Mayor Hays' letter or have any questions, please give
me a call.

Additionally, I want to confirm some information with you.

1. In your proposal you stated that you would utilized firm contracts inside
Entergy as sources for supplying NLR & Benton.  Can you identify the sources
you would initially point to for submission of the Network Transmission
Service request.

2. Confirm our understanding that your price includes Schedules 3 - 6 costs.

3.  Please identify each major party associated with Enron's proposal and
describe the role of each including contracting party, parent company of
contracting party if different, owner of resources if different and any
other parties that would have a role in the proposed transaction.

4. As you know Benton does not have a SCADA system. We are unsure about
bringing their metering points into our SCADA system.  Do you have a per
metering point price estimate to acquire the metering information directly
from Benton.

I know this is short notice but if you could respond by close of business
11/6 it would be appreciated.

Joe Gertsch

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Michael,  Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay will not testify at either Congressional hearing this week.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says because of Lay's decision not to appear, the Senate Commerce Committee is expected to authorize the issuance of a subpoena to Lay as early as Tuesday morning.  Two House subcommittees could soon issue their own subpoenas as well.  A subpoena would compel Lay to appear, but it does not guarantee he will testify - he could invoke his constitutional right not to speak.   Other hearings involving Enron will proceed as planned, with three hearings scheduled for Tuesday morning.  One of the hearings involves Enron board member William Powers, who will testify in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight Subcommittee. Powers led the internal investigation at Enron, resulting in a report released this weekend that was highly critical of the company's management team.  We'll have highlights from Powers' testimony on Tuesday from Washington.   Unsecured creditors can help ensure a better rate of return on what they're owed by Enron through claims trading.  That's according to Haynes and Boone LLP Attorney Lenny Parkins.  He'll join us during the noon ET newscast from the Houston bureau to discuss the process of claims trading and how creditors can assure they will receive some sort of payment.   Also from Houston on Tuesday, Williams Gas Pipeline CEO Doug Whisenant talks about pipeline safety following September 11. He'll also discuss the future of Williams Gas Pipelines.   We'll have more from the one-on-one interview between West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas and California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch.  Kym says Lynch will discuss the ongoing negotiations with generators to rework the state's long-term power contracts.    Closing Prices for Monday, Feb. 4, 2002    Crude: $20.07/bbl -$0.31   Unleaded: $0.5931/gallon -$0.0103   Heating Oil: $0.5381/gallon -$0.0150   Gas: $2.117/mmBtu -$0.021   Fwd uE(Mar.): $3.57/mmBtu +$0.05   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests reschedule or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Nicolay, Christi L.

Subject:	FW: FERC Meeting on November 7

TJ and Claude-please send to your groups. thanks.

 

FERC's meeting scheduled for Wednesday, November 7, does not have any RTO dockets on the agenda.  The generic docket ""Electricity Market Design and Structure,"" which is the docket FERC is using for its ""RTO Week"" proceeding, is included on the agenda, but we do not expect any significant actions in this docket because FERC is still taking comments from the industry on the outcome of RTO Week.  However, this new Commission has surprised us before, so if anything of import happens at next week's meeting, we'll notify you immediately. 

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Sarah

  [IMAGE] December 20, 2001 [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] Volume IV, Issue 108 [IMAGE]     Email : info@otcjournal.com   URL : http://www.otcjournal.com    To OTC Journal Members:      [IMAGE] Year End Update on Astralis LTD (OTC BB: ASTR)   [IMAGE]  We started covering Astralis at the end of September, prior to the completion of a merger which made Astralis a public company. At the time we were very excited about the public having the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potential medical breakthrough at a valuation commensurate with levels generally reserved for sophisticated investors in the biotech industry.   While the stock has been lackluster for the last two months, the company announced an Agreement on December 12th which serves to reinforce our original hypothesis.   By way of reminder, Astralis ""has completed clinical studies in Venezuela using first generation Psoraxine to treat 3,000 psoriasis patients, the majority of whom responded positively with few side effects. Of the 3,000 treated patients, 638 achieved complete remission, whilst nearly half of all patients experienced a reduction in disease of between 70% and 90%, as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), a validated outcomes measure. Overall, 96% of the patients had a positive response to Psoraxine, although these results have not yet been independently verified."" from December 12 press release.   On December 12th, Astralis revealed it had entered into several agreements with SkyePharma PLC (NASDAQ: SKYE), a British pharmaceutical company which specializes in drug delivery technologies.   The press release revealed that Astralis will pay a $5 million license fee for drug deliveries technologies. Conversely, SkyePharma will invest $20 million directly into Astralis in the form of a convertible preferred security in return for 15.3% of the company.   SkyePharma's investment of $20 million in return for 15.3% of the company implies they see upside in Astralis' technology at a $130 million valuation, a level from which they certainly hope and intend to make a substantial return on their investment.   Based on the current price of the stock, and our estimate of 38 million shares issued and outstanding, the market is currently placing a value on the company of just over $100 million.   Simply put, this means Astralis can be purchased up to about $3.40 per share before you are paying more than SkyePharma was willing to pay. They are investing $20 million.   SkyePharma's revenues were up 40% through the first six months of 2001, an explosive growth rate and the sign of a well managed company.   Look for this stock to start behaving better in 2002. Once the funding is completed, Astralis will be positioned to apply for an upgraded listing to either the NASDAQ or the American Stock Exchange.   The risk associated with an investment in Astralis is mitigated greatly by the capital they now have to fund the New Drug Application and a partnership with a successful international biotech company.   Here is the complete text of the news release for your review:     Wednesday December 12, 6:01 am Eastern Time  Press Release  SOURCE: SkyePharma PLC; Astralis LTD   SkyePharma and Astralis Enter Agreements For Promising New Psoriasis Treatment  LONDON, and FLORHAM PARK, N.J., Dec. 12 /PRNewswire -- SkyePharma PLC (Nasdaq: SKYE; LSE: SKP) and Astralis LTD (OTC Bulletin Board: ASTR - news) announce several agreements concerning the formulation and development of Astralis' novel injectable vaccine therapy, Psoraxine(TM), for the treatment of all forms of psoriasis, a chronic skin disorder that affects approximately 3% of the world population.   Under the terms of a technology access agreement, SkyePharma will receive from Astralis a US$5 million license fee, which will be recognised as revenue over the lifetime of the contract, for access to DepoFoam and other relevant drug delivery technologies. In addition, through a service agreement, SkyePharma will provide all development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical development services for second generation Psoraxine, up to the completion of Phase II clinical studies. On completion of Phase II studies, Astralis will offer SkyePharma the option to acquire the worldwide licensing and distribution rights to Psoraxine. If SkyePharma does not take the option, Astralis will seek a marketing partner to fund Phase III clinical studies and to provide a sales and marketing infrastructure. It is anticipated that an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to start Phase I-B clinical studies will be filed with the US Food and Drug Administration in the first half of 2002.   In a separate transaction, SkyePharma will make a total equity investment in Astralis of up to US$20 million in convertible preferred shares, on payment for which SkyePharma will own 15.3% of Astralis. SkyePharma will make an initial investment of US$10 million on signature of the agreement. The remaining US$10 million investment will be paid at times and in quantities, amongst other conditions, dependent on the date of filing the US IND, up to January 31, 2003.   There is no approved cure for psoriasis. Most approved treatment protocols provide temporary or incomplete relief and may, with certain systemic treatments, cause serious side effects. Psoraxine, developed by Astralis' Chairman Dr. Jose Antonio O'Daly MD, PhD, is a protein that stimulates cells from the patient's immune system to reverse the inflammatory process responsible for psoriasis symptoms.   Astralis has completed clinical studies in Venezuela using first generation Psoraxine to treat 3,000 psoriasis patients, the majority of whom responded positively with few side effects. Of the 3,000 treated patients, 638 achieved complete remission, whilst nearly half of all patients experienced a reduction in disease of between 70% and 90%, as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), a validated outcomes measure. Overall, 96% of the patients had a positive response to Psoraxine, although these results have not yet been independently verified.   Professor James Leyden, a Board member of the American Academy of Dermatology and past chairman of the Dermatology Foundation, said, ``I have had the opportunity to review the data generated in Venezuela, and was very encouraged by the results. I believe Psoraxine could be an exciting new treatment alternative for many of the world's psoriasis sufferers. We look forward to becoming an integral part of the ongoing clinical program.''   Michael Ashton, SkyePharma's chief executive officer commented, ``Our ability to provide Astralis with manufacturing, pre-clinical, clinical and regulatory services, as well as access to a broad drug delivery technology platform, makes SkyePharma ideally suited to their needs. We, in turn, are very excited by the opportunity to share in Astralis' promising discovery. It is rare to find a potential drug that has already shown such encouraging, early-stage clinical results in around 3,000 patients.''   Astralis' Chief Executive Officer, Mike Ajnsztajn, said, ``We are excited to enter into this agreement with SkyePharma, because they have a proven track record in achieving FDA approval for novel products as evidenced by the dermatological product, Solaraze, indicated for actinic keratosis. This relationship will enable us to validate the results from our prior clinical studies and to move aggressively toward gathering the necessary data for US regulatory and marketing approval. SkyePharma's equity investment confirms our collective commitment to introduce this promising product.''   This press release may contain forward-looking statements regarding SkyePharma PLC or Astralis LTD. Actual results may differ materially from those described in the press release as a result of a number of factors, including but not limited to the following: There can be no assurance that Psoraxine will be successfully developed or manufactured, or that final results of human clinical trials will result in the regulatory approvals required to market products, or that final regulatory approval will be received in a timely manner, if at all, or that patient and physician acceptance of this product will be achieved. SkyePharma PLC and Astralis LTD undertake no obligation to revise or update any such forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release.   Notes   Astralis LTD, an emerging biotechnology company based in New Jersey, focuses on the research and development of novel treatments for immune system disorders and skin diseases. Psoraxine, the company's first product, is an innovative drug under development for psoriasis, and is based on the company's discovery of a new gene sequence of proteins. To date, clinical data suggest remission of this skin condition in patient trials in Venezuela.   SkyePharma PLC, an established drug delivery company, based in the UK, provides innovative services to major pharmaceutical partners from the point of drug discovery through the approval process. Its five technologies, oral, injectable, inhalation, topical, and nanoparticulate solubilisation encompass the vast majority of delivery systems in use by the pharmaceutical industry. For more information, visit SkyePharma's web site at http://www.skyepharma.com .   Psoriasis   Psoriasis is a chronic, genetically based remitting and relapsing scaly and inflammatory skin disorder that affects approximately 3% of the world's population. Psoriasis symptoms result from the overproduction of skin by blood cells associated with the immune system. These blood cells become confused and act as though the skin was damaged, manufacturing skin cells at a much faster rate than is required by undamaged skin. The overproduction of skin can cause everything from itchy rash like patches to painful pustules and massive inflammation. Most current treatments are sub-optimal and some systemic treatments can cause serious side effects.

He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/23/01 Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. He hurt himself on a PAT attempt, but Gramatica is expected to play on December 29.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith  , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden  , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.  Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner  , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Michael,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.   Just a reminder - On Friday, Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante is live in Cairo, Egypt covering the OPEC meeting.  Join us tomorrow as Kim brings us the latest on possible oil production cuts beginning in January.      We'll also have more reaction from here in Washington to the OPEC meeting.  American Petroleum Institute Chief Economist John Felmy, Ph.D., will share his thoughts on the cartel's moves and what they might mean for the U.S.  Also during the 12:00 p.m. ET newscast, The Petroleum Finance Company Senior Market Analyst George Beranek will give us his assessment of the market if OPEC follows through with a production cut.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has had a very busy year - from the California crisis to the crisis at Enron, the Commission has had a full docket.  On Friday during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast, we'll hear what former FERC Chairman James Hoecker thinks about the past year at the FERC and what issues may surface during the New Year.   As the year draws to a close, the Houston bureau will take a look back at one of the biggest energy stories - the collapse of the energy giant, Enron.  Houston Bureau Chief Myra Jolivet says on Friday, the Houston bureau will review the timetable of Enron's demise, the effects of its bankruptcy filing, layoffs and the company's downgraded credit rating.    As Texas deregulation nears, competition in the market is heating up among retail energy providers.  The Houston bureau says the Texas Public Utility Commission set the price to beat for areas in the state, and competing retail energy providers are beating those prices.  We'll have all the details from the Houston bureau on Friday.   West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says on Friday, California Senator Debra Bowen talks about what to expect from the legislature in the first few weeks of 2002.  Kym says possible topics of discussion include the issuance of the state's $12.5 billion in energy bonds, the California Power Authority and plans to get Southern California Edison and PG?out of debt.   Also on Friday from the West Coast bureau, California Energy Commissioner Michael Moore talks about the gas supplies in California.  Join us for these reports and more from Sacramento tomorrow.    Closing Prices for Thursday, Dec. 27, 2001    Crude: $20.90/bbl -$0.37   Unleaded: $0.5927/gallon -$0.0086   Heating Oil: $0.5815/gallon -$0.0131   Gas: $2.555/mmBtu -$0.356   Broadcasting Note: On New Year's Eve, we're broadcasting through 1:00 p.m. ET.

"graduate news and notes 10/28","
  
Dear Graduate Brothers,
            Things have been a little hectic around here lately.  In the last two weeks we have had Dad's Weekend, Homecoming, and FIJI Run.  We are all just now getting back into the normal routine.  There have been many positive things happening around here though:
 
Dad's Weekend we a huge success, except for K-State losing to Texas A&M.  All the Dad's a great time hanging out with there son's and learning what type of brotherhood we have developed here.
 
FIJI Run was also very successful.  This year it was the same week as homecoming so we chose to run the ball from Lawrence to Manhattan on Monday instead of Friday.  Between the two chapters we raised over $32,000, with $18,500 coming from Chi Deuteron alone.
 
Homecoming was a good time as always.  Our partners weren't too much help this year, but the Phi Gams represented well, and made it as crazy as ever.
 
5-8 of us will be traveling to William Woods in Fulton, MO this weekend for their chartering.  Three members will be on the initiation team there.  If anyone is interested in attending the festivities, email Terry Meyers at tmeyers@ussafety.com .  
 
Fraternally,
 
Kurt Niebuhr
Recording Secretary

"Enron Update","
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Check the Fantasy News area throughout the week for news and advice from our experts.

    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  	


  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  	


  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  	


    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

"FW: Move Related Issues","

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

"CURVES","Mike,

The change in the curves only shows a .60 increase today.  The curves were down anywhere from .60 to 1.65 previous which was supposed to be up .25.  Cin was up @ .15 today.  That would mean that ENT should be up at least the amount it was down the previous day plus any increase marked today.  Can you look into this for me.  This is causing a $2MM hit in the books down here.  Thanks.

-Joe

Week Five - Healthy Habit Tip
Stress Management:   ""Take Five""  It takes only 5-minutes to recharge your batteries with renewed energy.
Relax and sit in a comfortable chair.
If possible close your door and your eyes.
Slowly take deep breaths, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth.
Focus on a beautiful scene, special moment, happy occasion, or warm feeling.

Don't be fooled by the term ""fat free"" on a food label.  While there are a myriad of fat free products on the market today, many of them are loaded with calories and concentrated sugars.  May fat free versions of foods contain only a few less calories per serving then their fatty counterparts.  Five fat free cookies 50 calories each still adds up to a significant caloric intake.  Be a smart shopper.  Compare calorie and fat contents when choosing products and practice moderation when eating high sugar or high fat foods. 

Members who workout a minimum of (3) times each week between October 22nd and December 14th will be entered in the weekly drawing for massages, apparel, and more.  (Weekly participation based on members Enron ID badge check-ins at the Body Shop Front Desk).
Congrats to:  Pete Prelli -Winner of Week Four Massage & Kenneth Mathis - Winner of Week Four Enron Travel Bag

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

He should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Powers Rangers Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this! w! eek,"" coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your roster as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times . He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Powers Rangers Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/2! 0/! 01 Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this w! ee! k.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no Q! B ! controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in.""   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Kens Killers Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player! , ! but he is a key blocker for Duce Staley.    Giants , DT NYG - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/20/01 According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 ! Th! e Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surg! er! y. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. ""I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job,"" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday against San Diego.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Michael,  Members of Congress return from their Thanksgiving break on Tuesday as debate resumes in Washington.  A bill that would renew the Price Anderson Act is being brought to the floor of the House of Representatives.  The bill limits the liability for the nuclear industry in the event of a major accident.  Significant revisions were made to the legislation in the wake of the September 11 attacks, with the addition of amendments that would strengthen the security of America's nuclear power plants.     The Washington bureau will also have more reaction to the FERC's new policy for determining whether a company has market power in the electricity industry.  Join us for these reports from the Washington bureau on Tuesday.   From Houston on Tuesday, we'll bring you an update on Enron's continuing financial situation.  UBS PaineWebber's Robert Young is stopping by the Houston bureau to discuss his perspective on the negotiations between Enron and Dynegy.  He'll join us during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   The Former Energy Advisor to the Prime Minister of Iran is speaking in Houston on Tuesday.  Dr. Fereidun Fesharaki will be talking to the Asia Society about the Middle East, oil and economics.

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 General Observations

 The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 FERC Deliverables

A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/30/01 Muhammad (toe) has been deactivated for Sunday's game. Isaac Byrd will start in his place.   Wesley Walls  , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/30/01 Walls (knee) has been declared inactive for Sunday's game. Kris Mangum will start in his place.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/30/01 Bouman has been deactivated for Sunday's game. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Dez White , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/30/01 White has been declared inactive for Sunday's game. David Terrell is expected to start in his place.   James Stewart , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/30/01 Stewart has been deactivated for Sunday's game. Lamont Warren will start in his place.   Mike McMahon , QB DET - Commissioner Updated 12/30/01 McMahon will not play on Sunday. Ty Detmer will start in his place.   Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/30/01 Bettis has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against the Bengals. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will start in his place.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - Chargers Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 12/28/01 Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/28/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/28/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/28/01 Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 12/28/01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload.

"Company is moving with news","
OTC Investor News has heard reports that Synergetics Tecnologies may be acquiring a bulletin board listing very soon.

Synergetic Technologies, Inc. announced in a press release on Monday February 4th that the company will begin beta testing of its airline security and anti-terrorism system. OTC Investor News has also heard a rumor that the company may be heading into a bulletin board entity in a very short timeframe. Share volume for the past six weeks is reflective of increased business activity and momentum as the stock has gained in price over the past two weeks and the potential for share appreciation seems quite positive.

OTC Investor News believes that immediate near term share appreciation will take place - Here's why:

* OTC Investment News has learned that strong support is coming in from European investors.

* SYGE has recently announced contract negotiations for substantial anti-terrorist system sales - we believe that many more contracts are on their way.

* SYGE recently announced the acquisition of Custom Broadband - completing the technical infrastructure required to deploy the anti-terror system in aircraft.

* OTC Investment News  Believes that a bulletin board listing is imminent. Typically, listing on the BB will enhance the share value.

* SYGE is near the low end of the price spectrum and is seeing record trading volume at this time. OTC Investment News  believes that there will not be a more opportune time to accumulate a position in this company.
***********************************************************
Equity Data for SYGE
Market Capitalization: U.S. $1 Million at current price
Shares Outstanding: 20,152,869 shares issued
Float 2,000,000 (approximate)
Current Share Price: $0.05
60 Day Target Price $.10

>
>        MANHATTAN, Kan. - Laurie Koehn scored 26 points to lift
>14th-ranked Kansas State to an 85-71 victory over Nebraska in a Big
>12 Conference women's basketball game Saturday played before a
>school-record crowd of 13,466 at Bramlage Coliseum.
>        The victory lifted the Wildcats to 16-1 overall and 4-0 in
>the Big 12, while the Cornhuskers fell to 11-6 and 1-3. K-State has
>won 13 straight games this season.
>        The crowd was announced as a sellout, the first for women's
>basketball in the history of Bramlage Coliseum. The previous high for
>attendance for a K-State women's game was 9,736, set on Feb. 22, 1997
>at a game against Kansas. It was also the largest crowd a Wildcat
>women's team had ever played before either home or away.
>        Kendra Wecker added 21 points and 12 rebounds for the
>Wildcats, while Nicole Ohlde finished 18 points and nine boards.
>        Katie Robinette scored 16 points on 7-for-18 shooting from
>the floor to lead four Nebraska players in double figures. K.C.
>Cowgill scored 15 points for the Huskers, all from three-point range,
>with Stephanie Jones adding 14 points and Keasha Cannon scoring 10.
>        Kansas State iced the victory by hitting 22 of 25 free throws
>in the game, including a 19-for-22 effort in the second half.
>        Kristin Rethman scored five points and Wecker added four in
>an early 9-0 run that put K-State ahead 14-5 with 13:46 left in the
>first half. Nebraska cut the lead to four once before halftime. The
>lead was six with 6:06 remaining in the half when back-to-back
>three-pointers by Koehn and Wecker pushed the Wildcats' edge to 33-21.
>        K-State led 45-32 at the break, as Koehn had 14 points and
>Wecker finished the first half with 13.
>        Nebraska used a 9-0 run early in the second half to cut the
>deficit to 49-45 with 14:19 to play. But the K-State lead was never
>less than four points the rest of the way. The 'Cats led 65-59 with
>7:16 left when Koehn buried a three-pointer and Ohlde hit two free
>throws to increase the lead to 11 with 6:21 remaining.
>        Kansas State led by at least 10 points the rest of the game.
>        Koehn's six three-pointers were the most ever by a Wildcat in
>a conference game. She hit 6 of 9 behind the arc and also went
>6-for-6 from the free-throw line. K-State got four blocked shots by
>Ohlde and five steals by Wecker in a solid floor game.
>        Nebraska held a 46-42 edge in rebounding, as all but one
>Husker who played had at least one rebound. Cannon finished with five
>assists for Nebraska.
>        Kansas State travels to Texas A&M on Jan. 16. The Wildcats'
>next home game is Jan. 23 against Kansas.

He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed of! f ! the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.  Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/23/01 Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB.   Eddie George , RB TEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/23/01 George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury. He left in the third quarter because of a neck injury but returned to the game.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.  Fred Beasley , RB SF - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/21/01 Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/21/01 A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Donald Hayes  , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 12/21/01 Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year. Don't use him during the remaining weeks of the NFL season.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 12/21/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.    Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Richardson hasn't been a consistent scoring threat this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy playoffs.   Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 12/21/01 Gonzalez hasn't played as well as expected this year. Still, he is too talented to bench during the Fantasy playoffs.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 12/21/01 Favre has been one of the best QBs this season. Count on him to help lead your team to Fantasy glory.  Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 12/21/01 Green has been an inconsistent Fantasy QB this year. He is a risky start during the rest of the season.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/21/01 Schroeder has had a solid season. Look for him to be a reliable No. 2 wideout during your postseason.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Hasselbeck has been a big disappointment this year. Don't use him during the Fantasy postseason.   Johnnie Morton , WR DET - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/21/01 Morton has been inconsistent this season but he will still be a solid No. 2 during the Fantasy playoffs. Keep him in your lineup.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams.   Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Kens Killers Updated 12/21/01 Toomer is having a bit of a down year, but his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers makes him worth considering. He should be a solid No. 2 wideout during your playoffs.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/21/01 Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in the playoff race.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/21/01 Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs.    Shawn Bryson , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 12/21/01 Bryson will start in place of the injured Travis Henry this week. Consider him as a No. 2 RB if you need help at that spot.

Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Jeffers may see some increased playing time this week because of Muhsin Muhammad's persistent toe problems. Isaac Byrd, however, still should start in Muhammad's place.   Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/27/01 Janikowski (groin) has been kicking in practice. He is expected to play this week.   Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Wilkins (hamstring) has returned to practice. He may be able to play this week.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Alexander (leg) was placed on injured reserve, officially ending his season. Walter Rasby will continue to start in his place, but Zeron Flemister has emerged as the team's best receiving tight end with Alexander out.   Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 The Seattle Times says Hasselbeck's season might be over. Mike Holmgren said he would only use him in an emergency this week, and the Seahawks coach may elect to have Hasselbeck use the season's final two games to rest his injured shoulder. Trent Dilfer will start at San Diego this week.   Amos Zereoue  , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Zereoue missed practice on Wednesday with a shoulder injury. He is listed as probable for this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Bouman practiced without pads on Wednesday. If he cannot practice fully on Thursday, Spergon Wynn will get the start this week.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/27/01 McCardell is listed as probable with a thigh injury. He should be able to start this week.   Chris Chambers , WR MIA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/27/01 Chambers is listed as questionable with an ankle injury. He practiced on Wednesday and should be able to play this week.   James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 McKnight is listed as questionable with an ankle injury. He practiced and is hopeful of playing this week.   Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 The Miami Herald reports Minor will get more work on offense this week. Lamar Smith will remain the starter, but the Dolphins are hoping Minor can inject some life into the offense.   James Stewart , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 The Detroit Free Press says Stewart is not expected to play this week because of a sprained ankle. Lamont Warren and Cory Schlesinger will assume most of the workload in his place.   Mike McMahon , QB DET - Commissioner Updated 12/27/01 The Detroit Free Press says McMahon is not expected to practice or play this week. Ty Detmer will start in his place.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/27/01 Griese told the Denver Post he is ready to take on the Broncos, although Mike Shanahan questioned how effective he would be in his return. ""How do you know with a concussion?"" Shanahan said. ""There should be no side effects. Hopefully there's not. But we have learned a lot through the years about concussions and how seri! ou! s they can be, and hopefully that's something in the past and they won't reoccur.""   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Shea is expected to miss the season's final two games with a shoulder injury. O.J. Santiago should remain in the starting lineup in Shea's place.   Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Smith underwent surgery on his left hamstring. He is expected to be ready for training camp next season and will compete for the starting job.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/27/01 Walls is listed as questionable with a knee injury. He was expected to be evaluated again on Thursday.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/27/01 Muhammad (turf toe) is not expected to play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again.   Travis Henry , RB BUF - Kens Killers Updated 12/27/01 Henry will sit out again this week with a sprained knee. Shawn Bryson will start for the second consecutive week.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/27/01 McNair missed practice Wednesday because of back pain.   ""I'm going to try to do some things tomorrow and hope it loosens up and not have as much pain as I had today,"" McNair said.   ""I'm not going to go out and try to force the issue. If it's still sore and still tight where I can't have all my mechanics right, I'm not going to force the issue.""     The Titans listed him as questionable yet again Wednesday, but McNair likely will play   Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/27/01 Bettis sat out Wednesday's practice, and indicated he might not play in the regular season's final two games. ""You want to take care of the injury first and if that means not playing, that means not playing,"" Bettis told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ""But you want to make sure you're healed up. The team playing as well as it has played allows me the opportunity to get healthy. I'm using it very, very wisely.""   Martin Gramatica , K TB - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/27/01 Gramatica sat out practice Wednesday, but is expected to test his injured leg on Thursday. Doug Brien and Brad Daluiso worked out Wednesday for the Buccaneers, who might sign one if Martin Gramatica can't kick against the Baltimore Ravens this week.   Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Trent Dilfer will start this week in place of Hasselbeck, whose separated left shoulder is too sore for him to play.    Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday.   ""There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore,"" Holmgren said.    James Stewart , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Stewart is day to day with a sprained ankle. His status for this week's game is unclear.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/26/01 Graham may miss his second consecutive game this week because of the death of his father. With Tim Dwight (lung) still ailing, Trevor Gaylor may have to start again.   Skip Hicks  , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Hicks is expected to miss this week's game with a hamstring injury, and may miss the rest of the season. Eddie George should assume a regular workload once again.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 12/26/01 Smith is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at this point of the postseason.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Bouman (thumb) may attempt to practice late in the week. His status remains unclear for this week's game, and Spergon Wynn is available to start if needed.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Martin Gramatica , K TB - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 12/28/01 Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/28/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/28/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/28/01 Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 12/28/01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Powers Rangers Updated 12/28/01 Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/28/01 Walls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/28/01 A banged-up Smith Toe/knee)  will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback.   Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 12/28/01 Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's ""full strength"" criteria for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/28/01 Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. ""Still questionable,"" coach Bill Cowher said. ""He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day.""   Doug Brien , K IND - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however t! he! club wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/28/01 According to the Pro Football News and Injury Report, Green has asthma, but he has practiced fully this week and will start against the Vikings.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Powers Rangers Updated 12/27/01 Thrash is listed as questionable with an ankle injury, but he is expected to play against the Giants.   Patrick Jeffers  , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Jeffers may see some increased playing time this week because of Muhsin Muhammad's persistent toe problems. Isaac Byrd, however, still should start in Muhammad's place.   Sebastian Janikowski , K OAK - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/27/01 Janikowski (groin) has been kicking in practice. He is expected to play this week.   Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Wilkins (hamstring) has returned to practice. He may be able to play this week.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Alexander (leg) was placed on injured reserve, officially ending his season. Walter Rasby will continue to start in his place, but Zeron Flemister has emerged as the team's best receiving tight end with Alexander out.   Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 The Seattle Times says Hasselbeck's season might be over. Mike Holmgren said he would only use him in an emergency this week, and the Seahawks coach may elect to have Hasselbeck use the season's final two games to rest his injured shoulder. Trent Dilfer will start at San Diego this week.   Amos Zereoue , RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Zereoue missed practice on Wednesday with a shoulder injury. He is listed as probable for this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/27/01 Bouman practiced without pads on Wednesday. If he cannot practice fully on Thursday, Spergon Wynn will get the start this week.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Corey Bradford , WR GB - Commissioner Updated 10/21/01 Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Commissioner Updated 10/21/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games this year and has become a major s! co! ring threat even though he is not very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Damons Doormats Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 10/21/01 Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod every week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - Powers Rangers Updated 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   ! Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Commissioner Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/21/0!  Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) starte! d ! Sunday's game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at ! De! troit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/21/01 McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.  Eddie George , RB TEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Chargers Updated 10/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , WR NO - Damons Doormats Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-qu! al! ity Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht  , TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.  J! er! ome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 ! Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Michael,  On Monday, the Washington bureau will follow up on the President's new push for energy legislation in Congress.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says on Friday, we heard some of the President's strongest language to date, urging Democrats in the Senate to bring a bill to the floor.    There are also several energy hearings scheduled in Congress next week, including one on possible new limits on power plant emissions in the Senate and another on MTBE in the House. The hearings are some of the first to be rescheduled since the anthrax scare hit Congress earlier this month.   RDI Consulting Principal Mark Morey is penciled in from the Washington bureau on Monday.  He'll share his insight on where the emissions issue stands on the Hill during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast.   Secretary of Interior Gale Norton was in Houston Friday at the IPAA conference.  On Monday Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us more from Secretary Norton on Lease Sale 181 and how drilling in ANWR will create thousands of jobs for Texans.     Noble Drilling CEO Jim Day will also stop by the Houston bureau to talk about his company's third-quarter earnings.  The company reported very good earnings but Day warns that the fourth quarter may not be as good because of a weakening economy.  Join us for all the details on Monday.     ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with Western States Petroleum Association Spokesperson Dave Fogarty next week.  Fogarty will discuss California's decision to ban MTBE by December 31, 2002 and whether the state is ready for this move.  Catch Fogarty from the West Coast bureau on Wednesday.    Former Governor Pete Wilson tells Kym he takes responsibility for signing the state's deregulation plan, but adds there were steps Governor Gray Davis could and should have taken to avoid what turned out to be an energy crisis.  Kym will have all the details on this story next week.   Finally from New York, Goldman Sachs Analyst Dave Fleischer will drop by to talk about the gas market during the noon ET newscast.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.  Have a fantastic weekend!   Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

third straight victory. Western  Carolina won at Florida State on Dec.
8 to start the winning streak. Martin  also had 29 points in the
Catamounts' last outing, a home win over  Guilford.
        The Wildcats fell to 5-4  overall.
        Gilson DeJesus led Kansas  State with 18 points, including a
5-for-7 effort from three-point range.  Travis Reynolds chipped in
with 13 points and 14 rebounds, his third  double-double of the
season. Larry Reid had eight points and six assists for  the Wildcats.
        A 15-point run in a  five-minute stretch early in the second
half helped the Catamounts erase a  45-35 deficit. Casey Rogers had a
pair of three-pointers and Martin scored  five points in the run that
put Western ahead 50-45 with 10:14  left.
        The Wildcats came back to  tie the game four times through the
remainder of the second half but never  regained the lead. Reynolds
scored to tie the game at 60-60 with 2:42 to  play. But Rogers hit one
of two free throws and Freeman converted a basket  after a Wildcat
miss to push the lead back to three  points.
        Pervis Pasco hit one of  two free throws for K-State with 1:15
left, and made only one of two again  after rebounding a Catamount
miss with 35 seconds left, bringing the Wildcats  within 63-62. Kori
Hatcher then hit a pair of foul shots for Western with 21  seconds to
play before Terence Woodyard stole the ball for the visitors  on
K-State's next possession.
         Woodyard hit one of two foul shots with eight seconds left to
put Western  ahead 66-62. Pasco made the final basket for K-State with
0.2 seconds  left.
        K-State hit just 31 percent  from the floor in the second half
on 9-for-29 shooting. The Wildcats, who hit  42 percent from the field
in the game, were also cold from the line, hitting  only 8 of 19 free
throws.
        The  Catamounts hit 54 percent of their shots in the second
half and finished with  a 15-for-18 mark at the foul line in the game.
Kelvin Wylie had seven  rebounds to lead Western on the  boards.
        Kansas State travels to  15th-ranked Iowa on Saturday before
returning home to play Fairleigh  Dickinson on Dec. 29 at 7 p.m.

games. If I receive the email timestamped  before then, I will make the trade for
the upcoming weekend. IF there is a Thursday night  game, Thursday 5:00 PM
is the deadline for THE WEEKEND. At any time  after the deadline if a transaction
is submitted, it will apply to the following  weekend. Also, there will be NO limit on

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Michael,  The Washington bureau will have a full plate when we return from Thanksgiving break.  Congress returns with many lawmakers urging action on energy legislation before the end of the year.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says there's a long list of legislation ahead of energy in the Democrat-controlled Senate, but Republicans are threatening to force a vote through a filibuster.  In turn, Democrats are saying they'll filibuster any energy bill containing a provision to open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.  The legislation battle continues next week.   Peter also says the Washington bureau will continue to follow the FERC's major decisions regarding how it assesses market power.  The Commission announced a major change this week that will impact many of the large and small utilities across the country.   Also next week, we'll see what Energy Daily Publisher Llewellyn King has to say about Pat Wood's performance as Chairman of the FERC.  And rumors are flying about DOE Secretary Spencer Abraham - on Monday, King talks about the whispers he's hearing in Washington.   ENL's Gale Smith will have a report from the Houston bureau next week on a Louisiana company that uses rice hulls to create power.  Agrilectric Incorporated consumes some of this power, but most of the electricity is sold to an area utility company.  We'll have details next week.   Also, Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us coverage from the Alaska Resources Conference taking place next Thursday and Friday.  We'll also bring you details on the final report regarding the chosen route of the Arctic natural gas pipeline.  The report is due to Alaska's Governor on November 30.   We'll hear from Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies Executive Director John White next week.  ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with White about his organization's opposition to the state's long-term power contracts.  Catch White from the West Coast bureau next week.   Closing Prices for Nov. 21, 2001:   Crude: $18.96       Unleaded: $0.5273   Heating Oil: $0.5342   Natural Gas: $2.813    Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. Have a great Thanksgiving break!  We'll see you on Monday.   Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

"CAN YOU HELP ME?---   Mike Carson","FROM Dr OLOGURU
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
UNION TOGOLAISE DU BANQUE
LOME- TOGO.
TEL:00228-911-40-37.



DEAR,
                   (CONFIDETIAL PLEASE)

I am Dr OLOGURU, chief accountant for the bills and
credits in the foreign remittance dept. section of
Union Togolaise Du Banque Lome-Togo in west Africa
with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact
you on a business transaction that will be very
beneficial to both of us at the end of the
transaction.

During our investigation and auditting in this bank,
my
department came across a very huge sum of money
belonging to a deceased person who died on november
1992 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in
his account with this Bank without any claim of the
fund in our custody either from his family or relation
before our discovery to this development.

Although personally, I keep this information secret
within myself and partner to enable the whole plans
and idea be Profitable and successful during the time
of execution. The said amount was $6,500,000.00usd(six
million five hundred thousand united states dollars).

As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive
information through my good friends who works with
chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here
in Lome-Togo. It is him who recommended your person
to me to be viable and capable to champion a business
of such magnitude without any problem .

Meanwhile all the whole arrangements to put claim over
this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,
get the required approval and transfer this money to a
foreign account has been put in place and directives
and needed information will be relayed to you as soon
as you indicate your interest and willingness to
assist us and also benefit your self to this great
business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because
of my position in this country as a civil servant, we
are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would
eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the
time
of transfer because I work in this bank.

This is the actual reason why it will require a second
party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of
kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and
also present a foreign account where he will need the
money to be re-transferred into, on his request as it
may be after due verification and clarification by the
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money
will be remitted from to your own designation bank
account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction
is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this
transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total
sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to
take care of expenses that may arise during the time
of transfer and also telephone and fax bills, while
60% will be for me and my partner.

Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as
we are still in service and intend to retire from
service after we conclude this deal with you. I will
be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank
until you confirm the money in your account. and ask
us
to come down to your country for subsequent sharing
of the fund according to percentage.

previously indicated and further investment, either in
your country or any country you advice us to invest
in. All other necessary information will be sent to
you
when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as
soon as possible, stating your wish in this deal.

Yours faithfully,
Dr.OLOGURU

However, he is not guaranteed to reclaim the starting running back job with Shaun Alexander performing so well. We recommend you hold onto both players until it becomes clear which one will get the starts over the second half of the season, although we're betting it will be Alexander.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/13/01 Smith predicted Monday that he will be able to return from a sprained right ankle in time for Sunday's game against Washington. If he can't go, Keith Poole would become Denver's top receiving option, with Chris Cole, Scottie Montgomery and Kevin Kasper also filling in. However, Poole is already expected to replace Eddie Kennison as the team's second wideout.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 11/13/01 Kennison returned to the Broncos Monday and informed them that he is ""unretiring,"" according to the Denver Post . While this is a radical turnaround from his message of retirement over the weekend, he might not be welcomed back by the team as a result of his change of decision. It is unclear whether Kennison will be placed on the reserve/suspended list or reinstated to the roster, but either way it's highly unlikely he will be able to help any Fantasy teams the remainder of the season. Drop him.  Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 According to published reports, Cleeland won't be available for Sunday's game against Indianapolis. His high ankle sprain still hasn't healed sufficently, so look for Boo Williams and Lamont Hall to get the majority of the playing time in his absence.   Santana Moss , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Moss is expected to make his season debut Sunday against Miami. He has been sidelined all season with a knee injury but is listed as probable for Sunday's game.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/13/01 Chrebet is expected to play Sunday, despite suffering from a shoulder injury. Look for him to be a solid No. 2 Fantasy receiver.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Feeleys Fanatics  Updated 11/13/01 Taylor is expected to play Sunday against Pittsburgh. He has been sidelined for over a month because of a groin injury.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Jones re-injured his shoulder in Sunday's game. He had an MRI done on the shoulder Monday. His status for this week's game is uncertain.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/13/01 Brunell is expected to play this week, despite suffering from a sore leg. However, he is not expected to ! pr! actice. Nevertheless, look for Brunell to be a productive No. 1 QB this week.   Chad Johnson , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Johnson might play on a limited basis in Sunday's game against Tennessee. He will be re-evalauted on Tuesday, according to The Cincinnati Post. Johnson has been sidelined for a month because of a fractured collarbone.  Terry Glenn , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Glenn should be able to play Sunday if he practices with the team this week, according to The Boston Herald . He has not practiced in over three weeks because of a hamstring injury. The Patriots first two workouts are on Tuesday and Wednesday.    Brian Natkin , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Natkin started Monday's game. He was used to replace the injured Shad Meier and Erron Kinney. Natkin played the entire game but had only one catch for 18 yards.    Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Wycheck left Monday's game briefly because of an ankle injury but returned. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. Wycheck had two catc! h! es for 18 yards Monday.   Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/13/01 Garcia made it through another game using a brace to protect his sprained knee, and had no problems afterwards. Head Coach Steve Mariucci is optimistic that Garcia will be able to play without the brace soon.   Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Kelly suffered both knee and ankle injuries during Sunday's win over Dallas. He will have an MRI this week to determine the extent of the injury, and his status for this weekend's game against Green Bay is unclear at this time.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Grbac started in Monday's game despite suffering from chest/rib injuries. He threw for 192 yards and a touchdown, but was also intercepted once. Nevertheless, Grbac appears to have overcome his injuries and should be a solid No. 1 QB this week.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/13/01 Warner admitted to STLtoday.com that the thumb injury he sustained in the season opener against Philadelphia is effecting his ability to throw the ball deep. The team has begun extensive treatment on the thumb, and coach Mike Martz doesn't feel as though his Pro Bowl QB will miss any playing time. ""I don't anticipate this being a real problem unless he gets it banged and re-injured,"" Martz said. ""He has played pretty well with it since Philadelphia. We should be fine.""   Terry Allen , RB BAL - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/13/01 Allen played in Monday's game against Tennessee but suffered a fractured left hand in his first and only carry of the game, during the second quarter. His status for Sunday's game is uncertain. !   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Dyson played in Monday's game despite suffering from a toe injury. It appears he has recovered from the injury. He had six catches for 68 yards and a touchdown. Dyson should be a productive No. 2 or No. 3 wideout if he remains healthy.   Panthers , DT CAR - Powers Rangers Updated 11/13/01 Defensive end Sean Gilbert will likely miss a month of action after suffering a Grade II sprain in his left knee on Sunday. In other news, linebackers Dan Morgan (ankle), Dean Wells (calf) and Cory Minor (knee) will likely! r! eturn to action this weekend against San Francisco.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/13/01 Weinke (shoulder), who missed Sunday's 48-14 loss to St. Louis, has been cleared to practice. His status for this weekend's game against San Francisco is still unclear, however, but coach George Seifert expects him to play.   Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Commissioner Updated 11/13/01 According to Head Coach Dan Reeves, Chandler's final status for Sunday's game against Green Bay won't be determined until at least Wednesday. Chandler missed his last start due to a rib injury, but Reeves believes that Chandler will be available for the game.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/12/01 Davis has a torn lateral meniscus in his left knee and will be out 10 to 12 days, Mike Shanahan said. He will undergo surgery, and is not expected to play in the next two games. Mike Anderson will start in his place.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/12/01! Schroeder may have re-aggravated his ankle injury during a TD celebration on Sunday. His current status is day to day.  Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 11/12/01 Bledsoe is expected to be cleared to return to practice this week, and he could be ready to play Sunday night against St. Louis.  Patriots coach Bill Belichick said Monday he expects the team's doctors to give Bledsoe the OK this week. But that doesn't mean he will replace Tom Brady, who is 5-2 as a starter since Bledsoe's chest injury, as the starting quarterback.    Kurt Warner  , QB STL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/12/01 Warner says his thumb is affecting the way he throws the ball. X-rays revealed a sprained ligament, and he will be limited in practice this week.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/12/01 According to published reports, Johnson will miss at least four weeks with a broken clavicle. Alex Van Pelt will start while he is out.  Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/12/01 Moss felt soreness in his ankle on Sunda! y,! but he is fine and there is no apparent reason to expect him to miss any playing time.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/12/01 Wheatley did not play at Seattle. His return date is still unclear.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/12/01 Jones (ankle) played on Sunday, but did not start. His current status is day to day.

He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fan! ta! sy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - Chargers Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Commissioner Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.!   Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Chargers Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Powers Rangers Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - Powers Rangers Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Damons Doormats Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Powers Rangers Updat! ed! 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Chargers Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Powers Rangers Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caug! ht! four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Commissioner Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/25/01 Muhamm! ad! missed Sunday's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

  [IMAGE] October 26, 2001 [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] Volume IV, Issue 92 [IMAGE]     Email : info@otcjournal.com   URL : http://www.otcjournal.com    To OTC Journal Members:     [IMAGE] Riskless Rebound Portfolio- Special Announcement [IMAGE]  As we mentioned in last weekends' edition, we are planning to publish a list of technology stocks trading well below both their cash and book values. These stocks are the fallen angels of the tech wreck.   We view some of these ideas as nearly riskless as the stocks are oversold to the point where they are trading below the cash they have per share with little or no debt. While they are all losing money, one can assume these stocks have the potential to rebound to at least their cash values with the NASDAQ surging nicely.   We have delayed the release of this exciting edition as several of the companies had yet to release September quarterly financial statements. We want to present these ideas based on the most current balance sheets. Some of them have begun moving up in sympathy with the NASDAQ's stellar performance this week, but we believe there is plenty of upside room.   Our mid week edition will provide some perspective on the state of the businesses of these companies, and our riskless rebound ideas will be published next weekend.      [IMAGE] Energy Power (OTC BB: EYPSF) - More Related News   We continue to receive boatloads of email traffic on this stock. It is is a stand out for us in a difficult year. The stock was trading at $2.34 on October 3rd, and made a breath taking run to a high of $5.37 on October 11th. This is a net move of 130% in an 8 day period- a throwback to 1999 and early 2000. Click Here  to read our updated profile.   If you haven't made money on this stock don't blame it on us. This is the fourth major high volume surge the stock has enjoyed this year, and we believe there is more to come.   After the meteoric rise to $5.37, the stock pulled back to the $3.50 level, and has now stabilized just under $4. Up or down from here is anybody's guess in the short term, but high volume surges to the upside are the norm for this stock, and positions can still be established on pullbacks.   While the short term trading activity is exciting, the long term prospects for the company's future improve everyday. As a result of international turmoil and President Bush's fears of war related interruptions of Middle Eastern oil, Bush's is energy policy favors development of Canadian natural resources. Our friends to the north are affectionately referring to this mega trend as the Bush Push.   Media coverage is fueling the increased volume in Canadian natural resource stocks. An article appeared in last Sunday's Toronto Star which we believe is a must read for anyone following Energy Power. Early in the article there is reference to Bush and Prime Minister Jean Chr?tien discussing new drilling initiatives in Alberta, and area where Energy Power is currently exploring for natural gas.    For inquiring minds who want to know, here the lead in and a link to the whole article on the web:     Toronto Star, October 21st edition  Fears fuel Bush's energy agenda    Fortress America worries about imports - even though Canada is principal supplier   William Walker  Washington Bureau   ""OSAMA BIN LADEN'S next weapon of terror against the United States could be an attack on its Persian Gulf oil suppliers, a fact President George W. Bush knows all too well.    That's why he's counting on Canada, in part, to play a crucial role in helping defend America from such devastating circumstances.""

[IMAGE] Ceco Environmental (NASDAQ: CECE) Rockets Up the Charts [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  There have been numerous small stocks benefiting from the recent high profile incidents of Anthrax exposure. Ceco Environmental has been the beneficiary of a spectacular run this week.   One of our editors covered this stock in 1998, and is familiar with their business. Ceco is one of the largest air filter manufacturers in the United States, with annual sales approaching $100 million.   The recently discovered air borne version of Anthrax found in Senate offices is considered biological weapons grade and has investigators very concerned.   In a press release issued Thursday, Chairman Philip DeZwerick pointed out that his company's filtration processes have already been used in the destruction of biological weapons.   In the last seven days the stock has been tearing up the charts. It was in the mid $2 range on October 18th, and is now trading at a new 52 week high in the mid $4 range. Today the stock pulled back a little, closing nearer to $4.   However, there may be more upside in this surge. The company only has about 8 million shares issued and outstanding, meaning the market capitalization is only $36 million with annual sales approaching $100 million.   We anticipate further high profile media coverage on this stock now that weapons grade airborne bio terrorism agents have been detected. Do your homework and decide if you like this idea.   Here is the complete text of their press release for your review:     Thursday October 25, 8:08 am Eastern Time  Press Release  SOURCE: CECO Environmental   CECO Environmental - Industry Leader Calls For Higher Government Standards For Air Ventilation Systems To Tackle Threat Of Bioterrorism  NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 25, 2001--The supplier of filtration systems to the U.S. military's chemical weapons destruction program, CECO Environmental (NASDAQ: CECE - news), is calling on governments to implement higher standards for air ventilation systems in public buildings, including airports, subways, shopping centers and schools.    The FBI has warned of the potential for the release of toxic chemicals, such as cyanide, into air handling systems of public buildings. Such systems have one or more fresh air intakes and a blower or similar device that moves the air through the ventilation system.    ``Currently many of these facilities have no effective filters at all in their ventilation systems,'' says Phil DeZwirek, CECO's Chairman and CEO. ``Ventilation systems generally are woefully outdated and there is nothing forcing contractors to upgrade them.'' The Building and Office Management Association (BOMA) has told its members that the release of a toxic chemical into an air handling system is a credible threat. ``Any release would be spread throughout the entire system within five minutes or less'' according to BOMA, which has advised its members to do all they can to make external fresh air intakes less accessible.    While CECO recognizes that this is an important first step, it believes the air ventilation systems themselves must be protected. ``We can do this today. CECO has had technology for years, including filtering systems that capture airborne biological agents,'' says DeZwirek.    CECO has been involved with the chemical weapons destruction program since its inception 15 years ago. Its filtering systems were engineered into incinerators where several thousand tons of Sarin and VX nerve gas and blister agents have so far been destroyed, along with more than half a million rockets, bombs, mortars and mines.    ``Our technology has successfully filtered all particles from the incineration process,'' says DeZwirek. CECO has more than three decades of experience dealing with industrial air pollution. In addition, it has developed and deployed systems that protect workers by successfully capturing deadly dust and poisonous gasses that can be produced during the manufacturing process. Its clients include numerous Fortune 100 companies including DuPont, Exxon and U.S. Steel. ``We have always been in the business of saving lives,'' says DeZwirek. ``We have built a $100-million dollar business in protecting workers and the public at large from the scourge of industrial pollutants. Now we are applying our vast knowledge and experience to an even more nefarious problem.'' CECO has established an internal task force to outline and provide recommendations for immediately and affordably implementing technological solutions that will help keep Americans safe in the commercial workplace.    ``The military has safely destroyed tons of deadly nerve gas with the help of CECO technology,'' DeZwirek says. ``Similar filters and air ventilation and purification systems can and must be deployed to protect the American public.'' ABOUT CECO ENVIRONMENTAL CECO Environmental Corp. is North America's largest independent air pollution control company. Through its five subsidiaries -- Air Purator Corporation, Busch Company, CECO Filters, kbd/Technic and Kirk & Blum - CECO manufactures and distributes s a wide spectrum of air quality services and products including: industrial air filters, high performance filter fabrics, environmental maintenance, monitoring and management services, and air quality improvements systems.

"Employee Assistance Program - Workshops Scheduled","
Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families. These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2:
	
	9:00 am -- 10:00 am
	11:00 am -- 12:00 pm
	1:30  pm --  2:30 pm
	3:30 pm --   4:30 pm

No advance registration is necessary -- simply come to EB32C2 at the scheduled day and time that is most convenient for you.

Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Wee! k ! Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Kens Killers Updated 10/22/01 Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week Seven.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice ! th! is week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"" Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy told the St. Petersburg Times. ""Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.  Brett Favre , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 10/22/01 Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. ""It'll be OK,"" Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that will help.""  James Stewart , RB DET - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren finished the game in his absence.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Despite a great performance by Thomas Sunday against Cincinnati, the Chicago Tribune reports that the Bears will continue to use an alternating syste! m ! with him and James Allen. ""We will continue to use them both,"" said offensive coordinator John Shoop. ""Anthony did a great job today, though."" As long as this duo continues to split carries, it's hard to recommend either as a weekly starter in a Fantasy league. We believe Thomas is the better long-term pick, though.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Hoover left Sunday's game after suffering a concussion. The injury is not believed to be serious. Monitor Hoover's situation. He might get some carries now that starter Tshimanga Biakabutuka is out for the season.   Fred Baxter , TE CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Baxter returned from muscle spasms Sunday against Cincinnati, and had a one-yard TD reception in the game. Despite the solid performance, he's still not a reliable weekly starter in a Fantasy league.  Robert Wilson , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Wilson suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game and was held to a 24-yard reception. He is also recovering from a broken thumb. Wilson will be evaluated on a daily basis.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Cleeland suffered a knee injury in Sunday's game, but it is not considered to be serious. He still managed to catch one pass, a 19-yard TD reception. Cleeland will be evaluated on a daily basis.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated! 1! 0/22/01 Terrell will start at wide receiver in place of injured Marcus Robinson in Sunday's game against San Francisco. If you're a Robinson owner, consider adding Terrell to your squad. The rookie had seven receptions for 91 yards on Sunday.  Neil Rackers , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 According to published reports, the Bengals are becoming frustrated with Rackers' erratic play. The team might look into signing another kicker.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/22/01 Jones sprained his ankle against Denver. His current! s! tatus is day to day.  Darnay Scott , WR CIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Scott suffered bruised ribs against the Bears. He is not expected to miss next week's game against Detroit.  J.R. Redmond , RB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Redmond made his return from an ankle injury on Sunday, and had one carry for no yards. He won't see enough playing time to help Fantasy leaguers.  Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Powers Rangers Updated 10/22/01 Grbac is day to day with a rib contusion. His status for next week;s game is uncertain. Randall Cunningham would start if Grbac can't play.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/22/01 Allen is day to day with a sprained left ankle. According to the Baltimore Sun, the Ravens have been shopping for RB help, indicating Allen's status as a starter is anything but firm.  Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Christian suffered a sprained neck in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a daily basis. !  Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Jefferson aggravated back, left ankle and big toe injuries Sunday and also burst the bursa sac in his right elbow. He might not be at full strength, but Jefferson is expected to play when the Falcons return from their bye on November 4.    Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/22/01 Smith suffered a sprained knee Sunday but is expected to play in the Falcons' next game. Atlanta has a bye this week and doesn't play again until November 4.   Isaac Bruce , WR ST! L ! - Powers Rangers Updated 10/22/01 Bruce was held to two catches for 37 yards Sunday, but that wasn't necessarily a reflection on him. The Rams were able to run the ball successfully so they didn't pass as much as they normally do. Look for Bruce to do better next week against the Saints.   Germane Crowell , WR DET - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/22/01 Detroit Lions coach Marty Mornhinweg said Monday that Crowell tore the patella tendon in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season. Crowell suffered the injury while leaping for a pass in the end zone in the second half of Sunday's game. The Lions will use a combination of Larry Foster, Scotty Anderson and Desmond Howard in his absence.  Marcus Robinson  , WR CHI - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/22/01 Robinson suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament in his left knee in Sunday's win over the Cincinnati Bengals and will miss the rest of the season. Robinson had to be carted off the field with six minutes left in the first half after the injury. Marty Booker will be the primary receiver in his absence.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards. He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has clearly emerged as a featured back.  Ricky Williams , RB NO - Kens Killers Updated 10/22/01 Williams, who was averaging 4.5 yards a carry, gained just 51 yards on 21 carries Sunday, a 2.4-yard average. He had eight carries for 5 yards in the second half. ""We couldn't do anything in the second half,"" Williams said. ""We didn't block right a few times, other times they filled holes and made plays."" Look for Williams to rebound and have a solid game against the Rams this Sunday.    Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Chandler had another solid game Sunday throwing touchdown passes of 57 and 39 yards. He also completed 14 of 20 passes for 187 yards. Look for him to be an adequate starter for the rest of th! e ! season.   Tim Biakabutuka , RB CAR - Commissioner Updated 10/22/01 Biakabutuka broke his foot in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game after rushing for 121 yards and a touchdown. He is to have surgery Monday and is out for the season.    Corey Bradford , WR GB - Commissioner Updated 10/21/01 Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

> Manhattan, KS (AP)- Tragedy has struck the sporting world yet again. 
> In a scene that has become all too familiar to sports fans, one person 
> was killed and several others were injured as the bandwagon carrying 
> thousands of life-long Kansas State Wildcat fans ran out of control when 
> all but two people jumped off. The name of the deceased has not been

> pending notification of his immediate family. He is believed to be a

> Dallas 
> Cowboys/Chicago Bulls/New York Mets fan, who was attempting a leap to the

> bandwagon. 
> The incident seems to have been caused by a 31-24 loss to Texas A&M 
> Saturday afternoon. 
> ""You hear about things like this in other towns, but I never thought it 
> would happen here"" said Bruce Snead, mayor of Manhattan. 
> Preliminary police reports indicated the wagon, which was recently 
> purchased from a dealer in Tallahassee, Fla., was in poor working 
> condition and could not handle the load from the hoards of Wildcat fans 
> that had climbed aboard. 
> ""We were getting concerned that this might happen after the loss to 
> Oklahoma,"" said Manhattan Police Chief Fitzgerald High. ""We really

> The incident was not without heroes. Kansas State quarterback Ell 
> Roberson, without regard for his own life, attempted to throw a rope to 
> the bandwagon's driver to help bring the vehicle under control. 
> Unfortunately, Roberson drastically under threw the driver, catching the 
> axle of the bandwagon instead, and was unable to hold on to the rope, 
> fumbling away his opportunity to aid those in need. 
> K-State's Mark Dunn attempted a similar effort, but his throw was 
> intercepted by a nearby tree, never to reach the bandwagon driver. 
> Kansas State head coach Bill Snyder could not be reached for comment.

any areas that may be necessary. To this end SPP is attaching the new Credit 
Policy for your review. We ask that it be directed to the proper person

conditions of the Credit Policy. We ask that you also complete the attached 
Credit Agreement and return it to SPP as soon as possible. 

SPP expects all customers to be compliant with the Credit Policy by December 
15, 2001. Please review the Credit Policy and take the necessary steps to be 
in compliance by that date so that there are no interruptions of service or

    Fantasy Football Matchups     Every Friday our Fantasy experts break down the key Fantasy matchup of the week. It may be a top running back facing a sturdy run defender; a deep-threat wideout matched up with a  premier cover-corner; or a gunslinging QB against a defense with ball-hawking safeties. We'll tell you who has the edge. We'll also highlight the key matchups in every NFL game to  help you decide who to start and who to bench. Check our  Fantasy News area (click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar)  Fridays for Fantasy Football Matchups.  	


    Customize Reports to Display the Info You Want     Did you know you can customize the settings of most reports  on the site, and save those settings so they are displayed  each time you visit the report? For example, suppose you'd  like the Transactions, View report to display only Add/Drops  over the past 7 days for all teams. Enter those settings,  click GO and then click the Save icon displayed over the  report. Now each time you click Transactions, View on the toolbar, the report is displayed according to your custom  settings. After you click Save you can click the E-Rept icon to have your new custom report e-mailed to you on the days you choose.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answer - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied.  	


  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game.  	


  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player.  	


    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will continue to be a productive player all season.

  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

He is expected to play against Detroit.  Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/29/01 Cleeland (ankle) should be able to play in the Saints' next game. His current status is day to day.  Warrick Dunn!  , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/29/01 According to published reports, Dunn (hamstring) may return to practice later this week. But don't be surprised if his workload may be lessened a bit after Mike Alstott's performance against Minnesota.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/29/01 Davis was inactive for Sunday's game, although he claimed he felt healthy enough to play. According to the Denver Post, there is no clear indication of when the Broncos will use Davis again. ""He never practiced last week with the first team,"" Mike Shanahan said.  Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/29/01 Leaf was the No. 2 QB vs. Arizona and did not play on Sunday. As of now, it is not clear who will start for the Cowboys at New York. Clint Stoerner may have played well enough to get the call again next week.  Jim Miller , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/29/01 Miller (hip) will be further evaluated on Monday. According to some published reports, he should be available for Chicago's next game.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/29/01 Johnson injured his right foot in Sunday's game at San Diego. The injury is not serious, says the Buffalo News. He also hurt his elbow and shoulder.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/29/01 Pittman suffered a concussion in Sunday's game at Dallas. His current status is day to day.  James Stewart , RB DET - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/29/01 Stewart was inactive for Sunday's game against the Bengals. Lamont Warren started at RB for the Lions.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/28/01 Johnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.""   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit.""   But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.     Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-y! ar! d run, but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/28/01 Jones overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - Commissioner Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price  , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/! 28! /01 The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Chargers Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Kens Killers Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and ! a ! TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter what the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Commissioner Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Damons Doormats Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Michael,  I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts.   On Friday, we'll bring you the latest from Washington on the final day of the FERC's weeklong workshop on Regional Transmission Organizations.  Participants have told our bureau the workshop has been productive and tomorrow we'll find out how the meetings might impact FERC's implementation of RTOs.  Former FERC Commissioner Don Santa will give us his thoughts during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast on where RTOs stand now.   We'll also get more reaction to the nomination of Joe Kelliher to fill the open seat at the FERC.  Gay Friedmann of the INGAA will give us her thoughts on Kelliher's nomination during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast.   Finally from Washington on Friday, we'll bring you the latest from Congress on energy legislation.  The anthrax scare has impacted an already crowded Congressional calendar and there's mixed opinion in the Senate on whether lawmakers there will vote on a comprehensive energy bill this year.     ENL's Gale Smith reports, a major energy company is launching a  one-of-a-kind Web site to buy fuel.  The unique idea behind this is that customers helped develop the site.  Motiva Vice President of Commercial Marketing and Distribution Ralph Grimmer talks about the site from the Houston bureau on Friday.   The Houston bureau will also bring us a report on Sakonnet Technology on Friday.  Sakonnet was started by a handful of former employees from JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch and has found success by being able to offer the same level of support as more established investment banks - for less money.  Join us tomorrow from the Houston bureau for all the details on Sakonnet.      From the West Coast bureau, ENL's Kym McNicholas says we'll have word on Friday from Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham's press conference and remarks from his keynote address at Hoover Institution's Conference on California's electricity crisis.       California Governor Gray Davis is expected to announce his administration's strategy to attempt renegotiation of the long-term power contracts the state signed between January and September of this year with electricity providers.  Log on for these stories and more from the West Coast bureau.    Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

As you all know by now, the Louisiana Tech game  tomorrow will not be televised.  However, the Missouri game, on the 24th at  11 a.m., will be televised.  There will be an unhosted watch party on that  date at the SRO in Northwest Mall on Hempstead Highway.  Plan to go and  cheer on the team with other Houston K-Staters.
 
Here's wishing you a great Thanksgiving  Holiday!  We'll be in Kansas for turkey dinner!

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang


Registration is required for a head count. 
Please call Shirley Crenshaw at 3-5290 to register.

Pizza and soft drinks will be served.

"Expense Reports","In anticipation of the imminent closing of the UBSW Energy transaction, please have all outstanding employee expenses in your possession filed through Enron's XMS system as soon as possible.   Note to approvers - please approve these expense reports quickly.   Enron will process and pay all pre-closing expenses.   After transaction closing,  payments  for expenses submitted before closing (and put into Enron's XMS system) will be sent to your last known address or direct deposited into your account.

Enron has committed to processing and paying any expenses incurred prior to transaction closing.   If not completed this week, pre-closing expenses should be submitted on a  hard copy expense report form which will be available at  www.enron.com. 
		
There will be a series of e-mails coming out over the next few days highlighting the Travel & Entertainment policies of UBSW Energy and the procedures for processing and payment.   

If you have any questions, please contact Hope Vargas (3-5280) or Georganne Hodges (3-0430).

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

"IMPORTANT!  Actions needed Tuesday.","In preparation for the upcoming move to Enron Center South we are moving your Home Directories to a new trading cluster.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
This will occur for you this EVENING after 6:30PM.  
We will need to restart your computer in order to complete this action.  
Please log out or your computer by 6:30PM, if the machine is not logged off we will reboot the machine in order to complete these actions.  
Save your data before going home this evening.
If you have outstanding circumstances and cannot be down, please speak to the tech when he comes to your desk.



HERE ARE A FEW OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION:
Newer, more stable environment
More disk space available for common data
Faster network connections



HOW THIS WILL EFFECT YOU:
If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the ""My Documents"" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the ""My Documents"" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems.

NERC Issues 2001/2002 Winter Reliability Assessment

Today NERC released its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment.  ""Generating
resources will be adequate to meet projected electricity demand in North
America during the 2001/2002 winter season,"" says Michehl R. Gent,
President and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Council
(NERC).  ""Significant generation has been added in several NERC Regions
and available capacity margins are expected to be equal to or greater
than those projected for last winter in the majority of the NERC
Regions.""

""Transmission systems in North America are also expected to perform
reliably,"" he added, ""although some transmission congestion is expected
during the course of the winter.""  According to the report, fuel
supplies, inventories, and deliveries are expected to be adequate this
winter.  Natural gas storage facilities are currently at levels 20
percent greater than the same time last year.

The report notes that the Pacific Northwest remains under a severe
drought condition that limits its ability to generate electricity from
hydropower resources, although reductions in customer demand are
sufficient to preclude the need for rotating blackouts.  California's
demand and resource situation has improved since last winter due to a
combination of increased resources and reduced demand.  California is
expected to have adequate capacity margins throughout the winter.

For a copy of the 2001/2002 Winter Assessment, visit NERC's web site at
(http://www.nerc.com).  NERC's web site also includes information on the
electric industry's electricity supply and delivery programs and
activities.

*********************

NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast
blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems
that serve North America.  It works with all segments of the electric
industry as well as customers to ""keep the lights on"" by developing and
encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these
systems.  NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account
for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada,
and a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.

  [IMAGE] November 16, 2001 [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] Volume IV, Issue 100 [IMAGE]     Email : info@otcjournal.com   URL : http://www.otcjournal.com    To OTC Journal Members:     [IMAGE] Riskless Rebound Portfolio [IMAGE]  Our November 2nd  edition, titled the Riskless Rebound portfolio, continues to climb the charts. As of today's market close, the portfolio as a whole has now appreciated fully 36.75% over a brief two weeks. The Deutshce Bank Alex Brown IPO Endwave Corporation (NASDAQ: ENWV) is leading the way, up 52% from $.84 to $1.28. The company came public on October 17, 2000 at $14 per share, and still has $1.78 per share in cash.   Readers will recall we computed the portfolio would rise 88% if each of the five stocks simply appreciated to the level of cash they had in the bank. Therefore, we believe there is considerably more upside in this group of five stocks.   However, the NASDAQ market has rebounded dramatically off the September 21st lows, and is probably a little ahead of itself. Therefore, we would caution members who are looking for good entry levels to wait for a correction sometime between now and the end of the year before entering or adding to positions. If such a pullback occurs, we will try to help you choose a good entry level.

[IMAGE] Energy Power (OTC BB: EYPSF) - September Quarterly Financial Results Strong   [IMAGE]  Short Sellers had to be a little demoralized by corporate performance when Energy Power released it's September (1st Quarter) Financial results on Thursday.   The stock staged a remarkable turn around on Wednesday when the bear assault forced the stock down from nearly $6 to a low of about $4. The stock turned around rapidly, and rebounded back above $5 when the company announced its year end audited results.   The stock continues trading over 1 million shares per day, which is historically unprecedented. The volume needs to quiet in order to identify a true support level for the stock. In the interim, based on historical trading patterns, that the next massive volume surge will take the stock above the $6 level. Members who chose to take profits when the stock traded above our target price of $5.60 should look to re-enter.   Another bear assault on the stock might be just such an opportunity. If the stock drops dramatically again as the result of another smear campaign we will get the word out as quickly as possible.   In the interim, shareholders should be heartened by September quarterly financial results, which are as follows:   Consolidated revenues were $5.5 million, up from $4.5 million last year (up 22%). Consolidated gross profits were $1 million, up from $.70 million last year (up 43%). Consolidated EBITDA profits were $.6 million, up from $.1 million last year (up 500%). Consolidated profits were $.40 million, up from a loss of $.1 last year. Earnings Per Share were $.05, up from a loss of $.07 last year. all figures in Canadian Dollars  Improved financial results were attributed to revenue flow from the newly formed Oil and Gas Division, combined with increasing business at the Engineering and Offshore Division. The company's decision to take massive voluntary write downs of assets last year also positions the company for increasing profits going forward. Click Here  to read the entire news release on their quarterly results.   The September quarterly financial performance is outstanding and should serve to reassure long term shareholders that management is performing. We expect the September quarter to be the first in a series of ongoing reports of growth in revenues and profits.     [IMAGE] XMLG Global Technologies (OTC BB: XMLG) Turn Around in its Infancy [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  The recent dramatic rise in the price of XML Global, one of our featured companies for 2001, has finally quieted, setting the stage for another surge to the upside. XML Global is a leading software company developing tools for the revolutionary new XML programming language which is widely viewed as the ""Holy Grail"" of ecommerce.   Despite the most challenging climate imaginable for a B to B middleware company, evidence is building that XML Global's fortunes are turning back up. After making a 300% move in five trading days, the stock has pulled back a little and quieted down, providing an excellent entry level for investors looking for powerful turn around situations in the speculative end of the market.   Recent corporate developments support the notion that now is the time to accumulate this stock. Since the beginning of November the company has announced three major new contracts- One with the city of Vancouver, one with the Canadian Federal Government, and one with HomeSource Capital.    The OTC Journal believes the HomeSource Capital contract to be the most important. XML is viewed by many as the future of interserver communication between corporate computer systems. Corporate expansion has slowed to a crawl during this recession, but as soon as IT spending picks up XML Global is positioned to grab a significant market share.   While most large corporations are embroiled in a bottoming business cycle, home finance companies are booming in a strong refinance market fueled by low interest rates. The HomeSource Capital contract suggests many other companies will use XML Global software as the business climate improves. Click Here  to read the entire text of the HomeSource contract.   While there is some risk of a slight pullback in this stock as a result of year end tax selling, we believe now is the time for bargain basement shoppers. The company is gaining the momentum we thought they would have before the recession, and as business turns up there is no telling where this company could go. If you want to own a $.35 stock that has a good chance of going back to $1, here's your opportunity.

"Weekly Update","Graduate Brothers, 
       
      Once again Pig Dinner will be held April 13.  If you have an address change or know someone that does email me or Ryan Czir,  ryanczir@hotmail.com .   
      Today we elected Brett Foltz graduate relations chair.  This is a newly created position in the house because the job used to fall under the pig chair.  So, if you have anything that you would like to see done please contact Brett at brettfoltz5@hotmail.com, or 785 395 0996 x 310.   
      I am doing some revision of the graduate list serve.  If you know of anyone that wants to be added or subtracted please contact me.  Thanks.

"Re: Pictures of little squirrel","What a cute baby squirrel!  How old is the little man?  Does he walk yet? I
 'm in Kansas right now...working for my Dad for a couple of weeks(and deer hunting), and am headed up to Manhattan tomorrow night......

I haven't done that in quite awhile!!  I am meeting Ruge and a few other KC Fiji boys, and Blair is coming from Denver.  I haven't been to Manhattan in 3 years or so, and haven't been to a KState f-ball game(in Manhattan) since the 97' season!  It's homecoming, so it should be a pretty fun weekend...of course now that I'm 10 years older than most of the kids there, I may have to be careful I don't get arrested for Child Molesting!!

He is still expected to start in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good for his injury.   Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to action this weekend against Carolina. He won'! t ! make much of a Fantasy impact, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11.   Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Commissioner Updated 11/19/01 Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to start this weekend's game against Washington.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.   Packers , DT GB - Damons Doormats Updated 11/19/01 Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remainder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting duties in Butler's absence.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennesse! an!  says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Damons Doormats Updated 11/19/01 Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day.   Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/19/01 Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01  Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Damons Doormats Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantasy value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post that there's a ""definite possibility"" he would be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 11/19/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dallas! f! aces Denver on Thanksgiving Day.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day.   Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried t! he! ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, con! si! der Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.  More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"CBS SPORTSLINE.COM FANTASY FOOTBALL NEWSLETTER","
[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	
  November 9, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox at the end of every week. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? The Top Performers   ? Audibles   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    The Top Performers     Want to see where your players rank among the top scorers in your Fantasy league? Click Statistics, Player Scoring on the toolbar. Initially, you'll see a list of your players, in order of the top Fantasy point scorers this season. Choose All Teams and All Positions from the listboxes above the report to view every player in the league, ranked by Fantasy points, and see how your players stack up.  	


    Audibles     Are you searching for that key free agent to propel your team into playoff contention, or to solidify your team's position atop the standings? Let us help. Read Audibles every Wednesday in our Fantasy News area (click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar) for our recommended pickups and drops for the week.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Kyle Buhler     My three running backs are: Corey Dillon, Warrick Dunn and Garrison Hearst. Which two should I start in week nine?    Answer - GG     Dillon is far too valuable to bench. That leaves Dunn and Hearst, and neither has been very reliable for Fantasy owners. We'd recommend Dunn based on the matchup. Hearst is facing a tough New Orleans defense that gave up only 66 yards rushing to Curtis Martin a week ago, while Dunn faces a Detroit unit that is allowing an astounding 146.9 rushing yards per game.  	


  Question - Charlie Oddo     Who should I start this week: Charlie Batch or Brian Griese?    Answer - GG     Batch had three straight solid games before stumbling badly this past weekend against San Francisco, and facing Tampa Bay doesn't bode well for his chances in week nine. He may also lose snaps to rookie Mike McMahon over the next few weeks, which is even more reason to avoid him. Griese hasn't been great, but he's still averaging close to two touchdown passes per game and is facing a San Diego secondary that has been very mediocre lately. The choice here is Griese, who is a much more reliable Fantasy QB than Batch, despite the fact that he's thrown nine interceptions in his last four games.  	


  Question - Matt MacLachlan     I need to pick one starter for a ""flex"" position (meaning any player on my roster can be used at this position.) Should I start Kevan Barlow, Kevin Johnson or Peerless Price?    Answer - GG     Barlow isn't getting enough carries (8.7 per game) to warrant serious Fantasy consideration at this time. Price has been unreliable for the most part, and facing a good New England secondary won't help his chances this week. Johnson has been the most consistent player of the three, especially over his last four games. Johnson has averaged 84.2 yards receiving and has four touchdowns over that span, and seems to be your best option.  	


    Tip of the Week      Pete Richards, Reading, PA: After a disappointing rookie campaign, Plaxico Burress is finally showing flashes of the talent he displayed at Michigan State. The emergence of Burress not only raises his own value as a Fantasy player, but it raises the stock of Jerome Bettis, Hines Ward and Kordell Stewart as well. Outside of Bettis, it's quite possible that Burress, Ward and Stewart are still available in many Fantasy leagues, and I feel that all three would make great midseason acquisitions.

"Health Habits - Week Four","Dear Body Shop Members,
""Healthy Habits for the Holidays"" October 22nd - December 14th

Week Four - Healthy Habit Tip
Stress Management:   Family members who traditionally oversee a household's holiday plans are particularly at risk for holiday depression since they frequently feel responsible for a family's good time!  Here's a few coping suggestions to help keep everything in perspective:
Relax!
Keep it simple.
Be realistic.
Ask for help.
Holiday food, gifts and decorations don't have to be elaborate.
Enjoy each other's company.
Remember the reason for the season!
If you're not the host, offer to help, bring food, baby-sit or clean up!
Weight Management:  Pumpkin is a remarkable healthy ingredient!  
High in fiber.
Provides 3.5 times the RDA of vitamin A
Pureed pumpkin (like applesauce and prune puree) can replace fats in baked goods without giving them a rubbery texture. 

Members who workout a minimum of (3) times each week between October 22nd and December 14th will be entered in the weekly drawing for massages, apparel, and more.  (Weekly participation based on members Enron ID badge check-ins at the Body Shop Front Desk).
Due to next week's shorter work week - members who workout a minimum of (1) time that week will be entered in the weekly drawing.
Congrats to:  Daniel Ayers-Winner of Week Three Massage & Karen Herrmann - Winner of Week Three Enron Travel Bag

>No. 7 Present Day Program: Kansas State
>
>Athlon has ranked the Top 10 college football programs of the present day.
>In order to best determine the current health of a program without merely
>copying the final 2001 polls, both of which (AP and Coaches) are identical
>from No. 1 through No. 14, we have examined a time depth of from five to
ten
>years. This will also serve the purpose of weeding out the possible ""flash
>in the pan,"" a one- or two-year phenomenon. The program must demonstrably
>stand on solid ground. Win-loss records, success against highly ranked
>opponents, conference domination and repeatedly high rankings all were
taken
>into consideration. And now, without further adieu, here are our findings.
>
>No. 10 Present Day Program: Oklahoma
>No. 9 Present Day Program: Oregon
>No. 8 Present Day Program: Virginia Tech
>
>
>No. 7 College Football Program of the Present Day
>Kansas State
>
>Some coaches are synonymous with their schools' rise to prominence.
>Florida's Steve Spurrier and Virginia Tech's Frank Beamer are two such
>coaches. Add Bill Snyder to the list.
>
>In 1989, Snyder took over as head coach of the worst program in
>major-college football. Kansas State was mired so deeply at the bottom of
>the all-time winning percentage list that as recently as 1996, after
winning
>28 games in the previous three years, the NCAA Football Records Book still
>ranked the Wildcats dead last at .394. But in the most recent standings,
>K-State stood at .422, fourth from the bottom and climbing steadily.
>
>Snyder came to Manhattan from Hayden Fry's staff at Iowa in 1989 with
Kansas
>State stuck in an 0-26-1 rut. Snyder's first campaign in as the Wildcats'
>head man wasn't much better at 1-10, but the one win was one more than they
>had registered in almost three years.
>
>In the 35 years previous to Snyder's arrival, the Wildcats won 97 games. In
>the 13 years since, they've won 105. They are one of only two Division I-A
>programs to have won 11 or more games in each season from 1997-2000
(Florida
>State is the other), and they posted nine or more wins eight straight years
>from 1993-2000.
>
>The Wildcats' 6-6 mark this season is their worst since 1992. From
>1993-2000, they never finished lower than third in the Big Eight/Big
>12-North standings. They won three straight Big 12 North championships in
>1998, 1999 and 2000. That's the same division as Nebraska.
>
>In 1997, Kansas State posted the first 11-win campaign in its history and
>followed it up with three more. In 1997 and '98, the Wildcats strung
>together a 20-game winning streak, including an 11-0 regular season in
1998,
>before dropping the Big 12 championship game to Texas A&M 36-33 in double
>overtime. Following the 1998 season, Snyder was named National Coach of the
>Year by consensus.
>
>During the 1990s, Kansas state posted a 63-6-1 record at KSU Stadium, the
>fifth-best home record in the nation during that decade.
>
>In 93 years of football competition before Snyder, K-State had played in
one
>bowl game - the 1982 Independence Bowl. The Wildcats have now been bowling
>nine straight years. In 1993, Snyder's fifth year in Manhattan, came the
>school's first bowl win, a 52-17 shellacking of Wyoming in the Copper Bowl.
>In the 2001 Cotton Bowl, the Wildcats mugged Tennessee 35-21 in a game that
>wasn't as close as the score indicated.
>
>The health of the Kansas State program promises an upswing in 2002 from
this
>year's disappointing showing. A dozen years ago, a 6-6 record would have
>been considered a crowning achievement at K-State. These days it is a
>disaster, and it still gets the Wildcats into the postseason.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"BMII- A Marketing Giant in the Making                        USIQKFHAK","
 
 Emerging Growth Stock Alert Blagman Media International: A Marketing Giant in the Making	
      Key Points about BMII:   BMII projects a total run rate of between $80-100 million in 2002.  BMII currently manages an advertising and promotional campaign for MET-Rx, the nation's leader in sports supplements.   Century Media, BMII's pending acquisition target, is one of the nation's largest direct marketing firms, with a dozen Fortune 1000 companies as clients.    BMII has the exclusive rights to market and advertise the national video release of a four video collector's set of the best of ""The Red Skelton Show.""   Company Name   Blagman Media International (OTCBB: BMII) Current Price $0.0012 (12 hundredths of one cent) 52-Week High $0.56 52-Week Low $0.0011   Company Background  Today we have a look at a classic merge and conquer scenario in the $200 billion dollar Direct Response sector.  The conqueror-to-be is called BMII (Blagman Media International, Inc.) The new company will combine the talents and clients of some of the biggest names in the infomercial world under the Blagman name.  With its announced plans to acquire major companies such as Century Media Inc. and Wellworld Group Ltd., BMII has quickly established a gateway for major immediate revenue stream coupled with rapid internal growth.  A-List clients have included the likes of Proctor & Gamble, Kodak, Dainler-Chrysler, Black and Decker, Home Shopping Network, and TriStar.  Total combined billings for BMII upon the completion of its acquisitions are expected to run from $80 to $100 million dollars in 2002.  This will give BMII the financial leverage and the know-how to change the face of the Direct Response industry.  Industry Stats  According to the Direct Marketing Association (DMA), U.S. direct marketing expenditures , currently at $191.6 billion, are expected to continue to grow annually at 7.1% from 2002 until 2005.  Moreover, U.S. sales revenue due to direct marketing is estimated to reach more than $1.8 trillion for 2001. Through 2005, such sales are estimated to grow by 9.6% annually to reach $2.7 trillion.   Again- Direct Response will cause $2.7 trillion (estimated) in sales by 2005.  This figure goes to show the effectiveness of direct marketing as well as the likelihood that demand for Direct Response will continue to grow over the years.    BMII's Growth Strategy  Recognizing the opportunity for strategic consolidation in the Direct Response industry, the management of Century Media and Blagman decided to utilize BMII to facilitate the acquisition strategy.  Through its public position, BMII assumed the lead role in the financing and negotiated the acquisition for a combination of stock and cash.  The company's senior management and board will consist of a combination of senior managers from both companies.  Currently, no other direct independent competitor to BMII is in the field of Direct Response having the breadth and depth of its combined enterprises.  At present, 99% of the pure play infomercial business is privately held.  And for good reason.  The margins offered by Direct Response sales are three and four times greater than traditional bricks-and-mortar retail. Profit potential that makes BMII a stock with tremendous upside.    BMII CEO Robert Blagman understands the Infomercial sector.  Says Blagman,  ""The primary purpose of these reverse mergers was to make BMII public and create a new BMII, a vehicle with which to build a media-buying infrastructure.  BMII will streamline operations, combine miscellaneous expenses, and create synergies within this larger structure to increase economies of scale and lower costs-per-eyeball for their clients.""  In Conclusion  Given its accomplishments and current plans, BMII appears to have great upside potential in the exciting infomercial market.  Blagman Media International has demonstrated is ability to capture substantial clients, as evidenced by its impressive client base.  The acquisitions of Century Media and Wellworld will provide BMII with an even larger client base with plenty of experience under its wing.     With an expected $80-100 million in billings for 2002 and the prospect of additional mergers, acquisitions, and new ventures, BMII gives investors plenty to look at given its price of just fractions of a penny per share.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/11/01 Anderson carried four times for 23 yards against San Diego. He won't play much now that Terrell Davis is healthy. Anderson was a disappointment when Davis was out as well, as he failed to match his 2000 form.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/11/01 Davis rushed for 83 yards on 33 carries and caught five passes for 36 yards against the Chargers. He is definitely healthy enough to start for most Fantasy! t! eams, but Davis doesn't run with the same burst that once made him an elite back.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Powers Rangers Updated 11/11/01 Flutie threw for 165 yards, one TD and was intercepted four times by Denver. Right now, Flutie is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/11/01 Conway caught three passes for 111 yards and a TD at Denver. He continues to be a reliable,a nd sometimes explosive Fantasy player.  Garrison Hearst , RB SF - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/11/01 Hearst had solid game against New Orleans, compiling 160 scrimmage yards on Sunday. He seems to have established himself as San Francisco's featured back in recent weeks, which is keeping Kevan Barlow's Fantasy value at a minimum.   Jeff Garcia , QB SF - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/11/01 Garcia, who is dealing with a sprained knee, had another big game against New Orleans. The Niners quarterback threw for 252 yards and four touchdowns, further establishing himself as a top-notch Fantasy quarterback. !   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/11/01 Horn had a big game against San Francisco, catching six passes for 99 yards and two scores. Horn now has six touchdowns in his last three games against the Niners, and is putting up some big numbers after a slow start to the season.   Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Kens Killers Updated 11/11/01 Brooks had a huge game on Sunday, throwing for 347 yards and two scores against San Francisco. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him.  Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/11/01 Buckhalter rushed for 66 yards and a TD against the Vikings. But he will see his numbers and playing time dwindle now that Duce Staley is healthy and capable of being a dependable RB again.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/11/01 Staley rushed for 146 yards and a TD, and caught six passes for 85 yards against the Vikings. There should be little doubt about his health or current value after his stellar outing.  Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/11/01 Moss caught seven passes for 95 yards and a TD at Philadelphia. He padded his numbers well after the outcome of the game was decided, and he still does not have a 100-yard receiving game this year.  Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Powers Rangers Updated 11/11/01 Bennett did not play at Philadelphia. Doug Chapman started in his place and finished with 19 rushing yards and 45 receiving yards.  Byron Chamberlain  , TE MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01 Chamberlain left Sunday's game after injuring his leg. He finished with two catches for 23 yards.  David Boston , WR ARI - Powers Rangers Updated 11/11/01 Boston had another huge game on Sunday, catching nine passes for 137 yards and a touchdown against the N.Y. Giants. He's become one of the best Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/11/01 P! it! tman was unimpressive on Sunday, rushing for only 54 yards in Arizona's 17-10 loss to the N.Y. Giants. Pittman is best used when the matchup is to his advantage, and not as a weekly Fantasy starter.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Chargers Updated 11/11/01 Hilliard had only 43 yards receiving against Arizona, but he did score a touchdown in New York's 17-10 win. The score was Hilliard's third in his last three games.   Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/11/01 Barber had a solid game against Arizona, compiling 118 yards rushing in the Giants' 17-10 win. Barber hasn't been very reliable as a Fantasy player this season, but he is useful when the matchup is right.   Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01 Wayne caught only two passes for 18 yards against the Dolphins. The rookie receiver is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/11/01 Harrison scorched the Dolphins for nine receptions, 174 yards and thr! ee! TDs. No defense is the league can contain Harrison when he plays in front of the home crowd.  Chris Chambers , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01 Chambers had the best game of his rookie year, catching three passes for 113 yards and two TDs. He has certainly become a great asset to Fantasy teams that are thin at WR or need help because of injuries or bye weeks.   Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/11/01 The Colts' defense held Smith to 53 yards on 18 carries. Rookie Travis Minor rushed for 71 yards and a TD (56 yards), and now there will be rampant speculation that Smith might be fading as a Fantasy player.  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/11/01 McCardell caught five passes for 61 yards and a TD against he Bengals. The veteran wideout has been unreliable for much of the year, and he may follow his good performance with a quiet week.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01 Mack rushed for 71 yards and two! T! Ds against the Bengals. He may have restored Jacksonville's faith in him after some questionable outings, but Mack is anything but reliable.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/11/01 The Jaguars held Dillon to 58 rushing yards, but he did score on a seven-yard TD run. Even if opponents limit Dillon's yardage numbers at times, it is difficult to stifle him completely. He remains worthy of No. 1 RB status on many Fantasy teams.  T.J. Houshmandzadeh , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01 Houshmandzadeh was Cincinnati's leading receiver at Jacksonville, catching six passes for 62 yards. Don't add him to your roster until he proves he can be a consistent contributor to the Bengals' passing game. Houshmandzadeh is a rookie, and he may fade away very quickly.  O.J. Santiago , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01 Santiago caught a 12-yard TD pass against the Steelers, and finished with two catches for 14 yards. Don't pick him up unless you are desperate for TE help, because Santiago has always been a Fantasy disappointment.  Kevin Johnson , WR CLE - Chargers Updated 11/11/01 Johnson caught a respectable eight passes for 62 yards against Pittsburgh's tough defense. Opposing secondaries are having trouble containing the third-year wideout, and he remains a must-start player every week.  Kris Brown , K PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01 Brown made five of six field goal attempts at Cleveland, including the game-winner from 32 yards. Despite his troubles in Week Eight, Brown has been a reliable kicker for most of his three-year career in Pittsburgh.  Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/11/01 Burress caught four passes for 44 yards at Cleveland. The second-year wideout has yet to produce respectable Fantasy numbers on a consistent basis,  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Commissioner Updated 11/11/01 Price caught three passes for 59 yards and a TD at New England. He continues to play well as defenses pay extra attention to Eric Moulds.

Dear Friends,
Just a brief word,
Please read Matthew 27:39-44. This is part  of a Lenten  study that I will be doing between now and Easter.  J. Ellsworth Kalas has  written many books the reflect today's theological thinking. The book for Lent  is Seven Words to the Cross. The first word is ""Scorn."" We will look at this  first word and then in March we will look at another one of the seven. I really  hope all of you can be here.

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	


    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	


  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	


  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	


    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

 	 	    Dear Michael,  The Washington bureau will have the latest on the anthrax scare on Capitol Hill on Thursday.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the decision to shut down the House of Representatives until Tuesday means at least one energy hearing on MTBE will be delayed.  The Senate remains in session and we hope to hear from Senators on Thursday about the situation.   Peter also says the bureau will have more reaction to the news that Department of Energy official Joe Kelliher has been picked by  President Bush to fill the vacant seat at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  Kelliher's name has been on the top of the list for some time, and now the decision is official.   PSE?Director of Interregional Transmission Laura Manz will also join us from the Washington bureau on Thursday.  Manz has been participating in the FERC RTO workshop, and she'll give us her take on what might come out of the weeklong meetings.  Join us during the  10:00 a.m. ET newscast for the Manz interview.   IBM Chemical and Petroleum Industry Vice President of Marketing Craig Hodges is penciled in from the Houston bureau on Thursday. IBM has been selected by Shell Oil to create the prototype for a wireless gas station named the e-Station.  Catch Hodges during the  noon ET newscast.   West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas reports, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham will be in California to announce a new public-private partnership regarding ""Path 15,"" a transmission bottleneck in California.  Abraham will also give a keynote address at Hoover Institution's Conference on California's Electricity.     Also from the West Coast bureau on Thursday, Kym talks with a Spokesperson about the Valero refinery's plan to build one power plant to operate the refinery and one to sell energy to off-site customers.  The California Energy Commission is expected to decide Wednesday night whether to grant the Valero refinery, located in Benicia, a permit to build.   From the NASDAQ in New York, NYMEX President Robert Collins will join us.  He'll discuss the status of NYMEX operations and trading following the September 11th attacks during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast.    Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

 	 	    Dear Michael,  Congress is out of town, but we've still got plenty of energy news from Washington.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meets on Tuesday.  One of the issues on the FERC's agenda is a complaint filed against the California Independent System Operator.  Some companies allege the ISO is giving the California Department of Water Resources preferential market treatment in its new role as California's main power purchaser.  We'll bring you the latest from the FERC on Tuesday.    ENL's Washington bureau will also cover the release of the North American Electric Reliability Council's Winter Assessment on Tuesday.  The new NERC report will be released at 9:30 a.m. ET from the National Press Club in Washington.   Also on Tuesday, ENL's Alison Kosik will bring us more from the Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology Conference in Washington.  The event focuses on the latest in clean coal innovation and the prospects for coal-fired generation in the U.S.   Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante reports, many companies feel wild price swings could be eliminated with more accurate weather predictions.  On Tuesday, Kim talks with Reliant Energy about steps that can be taken to minimize weather risks.   Ivanhoe Energy Vice President of Investor Relations John MacDonald talks with our Houston bureau about plans his company has for Gas-to-Liquids production.  This type of motor fuel is odorless and emissions-free.  We'll have more from MacDonald on Tuesday.   From the NASDAQ on Tuesday, ESAI Power and Gas Services Director Edward Kraples will join us.  During the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast, he'll talk about the amount of investment needed to keep Northwest power prices from escalating.   Broadcasting Note: Thanksgiving is this Thursday and the ENL staff is preparing the turkey.  The markets are closed Thursday and Friday, so we'll be dark.     Wrap Note: In response to many viewer requests, starting today we're going to add some of the day's commodity settles.  We hope you'll enjoy this new addition to the daily wrap.   Crude:  $17.72  Unleaded: $.5079  Heating Oil: $.5238  Natural Gas: $2.791   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	
  November 16, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	


  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	


  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	


    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

    The Prize 
Daniel Fisher and Lynn Cook, Forbes Magazine , 11.12.01 
The war against Osama bin Laden is also a contest for the world's largest producer of oil--and a way of life that underlies the American economy.
Hijackings and Anthrax could be just a warm-up to a very different kind of terrorism. The next thing we may have to worry about is a civil war in Saudi Arabia that turns oil into a weapon against the U.S. economy. 
Forget all the rhetoric about ousting infidels and saving starving Iraqis and oppressed Palestinians. Osama bin Laden's primary goal is to overthrow the ruling Al Saud family of Saudi Arabia. This subpopulation of 30,000 (in a country of 22.7 million) includes some 5,000 princes who control virtually all aspects of government and the military. Success would turn the kingdom's 260 billion barrels of crude--25% of the world's proven reserves--over to hostile hands. A fundamentalist government in Saudi Arabia would be ""ten times more powerful [than] Iraq or Iran,"" says Nawaf Obaid, a Saudi-raised oil expert and Ph.D. candidate at MIT who has written extensively about internal struggles in Saudi Arabia. ""They could make the Iranian mullahs look like babies."" 
Most observers, Obaid included, consider such a revolution unlikely. But bin Laden, Saudi Arabia's own homegrown terrorist, could wreak havoc with oil supplies in other ways--starting with simply surviving the attacks. The longer bombs fall on Afghanistan, the stronger the sympathy for the militants. The Al Saud family is vulnerable to intense internal pressure, especially from the ulema, or senior Muslim clerics. These are the self-appointed guardians of Saudi Arabia's dominant Wahhabi faith, a puritanical strain of Islam from which the royal family derives its legitimacy. The ulema could force the rulers to choose between loyalty to Wahhabism and adherence to a West-leaning policy favoring stable oil prices. 
It has happened before. Threatened by Iraq, the house of Saud tilted westward during the Gulf war and kept exports flowing. But in 1973, Obaid suggests, the ulema pushed King Faisal to impose an oil embargo on the U.S. to punish it for supporting Israel in the October war of that year--helping to shove America into a 15-month recession. 
The U.S. is even more dependent on Saudi oil than it was when we were driving gas-guzzlers in 1972. Even as the average car's fuel efficiency has risen 58% since then, U.S. oil consumption has risen 19% to 19.5 million barrels a day. Domestic oil production over the same period has fallen 39% to 5.8 million barrels. The rest of the crude is imported, with 1.5 million barrels coming from Saudi Arabia, a close second to Canada. 
America imports almost as much oil from Mexico and Venezuela. But the Saudis hold the whip hand in the oil market, thanks to their ability to increase production by as much as 2.5 million barrels a day--or cause a worldwide shortage by turning off the spigots. A terrorist bomb like the one that destroyed Khobar Towers in Dhahran, killing 19 U.S. servicemen in 1996, could achieve the same thing as an embargo by taking out Saudi Arabia's Ras Tanura export terminal, which can pump up to 5 million barrels a day into supertankers. ""It doesn't matter if we find 1.5 million barrels from somewhere else, if 5 million barrels a day are removed from the world market, prices will spike,"" says David Pursell, a director at Simmons & Co. in Houston. 
Any price increase has devastating effects on the U.S. economy. Each dollar increase in the per-barrel price of oil trims airline margins by half a percentage point and cuts profits by $450 million, says Goldman Sachs analyst Glenn Engel. Consuming 45 billion gallons of fuel a year, truckers are vulnerable, too: Trucking-company failures tripled from the previous year to 1,320 in last year's third quarter, as fuel prices rose 50%. 
The pain has a widening circle. Since oil is easily substituted for natural gas in many industrial and electrical turbines, prices of the two commodities tend to be correlated (coal less so). Stephen Brown, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, estimates that a 30% increase in the price of oil, sustained for two years, would trim U.S. gross domestic product by nearly 0.8%, or $800 billion a year, and decrease employment by 0.3%. 
And that's just an increase to $28 a barrel. Push the price of oil past $40 and refiners and petrochemicals manufacturers wither as economic activity plunges and costs rise faster than the prices they can charge.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/29/01 Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/29/01 McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to start.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/29/01 Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again.    Seahawks , DT SEA - Chargers Updated 12/29/01 CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place.   Spergon Wynn , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season.   Drew Bledsoe , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01 According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/28/01 Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/28/01 Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Damons Doormats Updated 12/28/01 Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   MarTay Jenkins , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.  Brian Finneran , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/28/01 Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/28/01 McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Woltys Wonders Updated 12/28/01 Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/28/01 Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week.   Aaron Shea , TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/28/01 Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 12/28/01 Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload.   James Thrash , WR PHI - Powers Rangers Updated 12/28/01 Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/28/01 Walls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week.   Maurice Smith , RB ATL - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/28/01 A banged-up Smith Toe/knee)  will continue to start for the Falcons. But Dan Reeves has indicated Rodney Thomas will continue to get some work at halfback.   Bob Christian , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Christian is day to day with a calf injury. He is expected to play this week.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 12/28/01 Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this week.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's ""full strength"" criteria for starting against Green Bay.   Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walk-through, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice.    Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/28/01 Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. ""Still questionable,"" coach Bill Cowher said. ""He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day.""   Doug Brien , K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01 Brien signed a one-year contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 48-21 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the club wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready.

"IPO Filing Alert : Porn Goes Public","
PORN GOES PUBLIC

With sharp economic ups and downs, it is surprising that any company would dare go public now. That is unless you happen to contain the only two money making Internet business models. Jade Entertainment Group (proposed symbol, NASDAQ OTCBB: JENT), announced it's self directed IPO of 500,000 shares of common stock at $3.00 per share recently, and expects to be publicly traded within 60 days.

So why risk an IPO now? Simple. JENT's main web property www.askjade.com merges the much acclaimed pay-per-click search engine model (goto.com and Findwhat.com:FWHT) and the ever-profitable Adult Entertainment Industry (Private: PRVT  and New Frontier Media: NOOF). Askjade.com is a mega adult search engine that allows owners of adult sites to bid on how much they will pay for a click-through to their site. This bid determines the placement within the engine. The higher the bid for particular keywords, the higher the bidder appears in the search results.

With plans to expand into content distribution, and over 300 webmasters already signed up and funding accounts, The company shows great promise of generating major revenues by years end. Already generating enough revenue to cover technical overhead, the company projects short term revenue in the millions. ""Going public allows us to quickly generate funds for marketing that will get us where we want to be sooner rather than later"", states President Tim Schmidt, ""Usually only webmasters and owners of adult sites get rich off of the industry, we are giving the investor a chance to take advantage.

A two-year study by Alexa Research has revealed, Sex-related terms remain quite popular among Internet searches. ""Sex"" was the most popular term for which people searched. Of all the terms searched for online, 0.3289% -- or roughly 1 of every 300 terms -- were ""sex."" People search for ""sex"" more often than ""games,"" ""music,"" ""travel,"" ""jokes,"" ""cars,"" ""jobs,"" ""weather"" and ""health"" combined. ""Porn"" (along with ""porno"" and ""pornography"") was the fourth most popular search term. ""Nude"" (and ""nudes""), ""xxx,"" ""Playboy"" and ""erotic stories"" (and ""erotica"") were also among the top 20.

Non-Tech Monthly Pick for Active Investors
=================================================================

PETsMART, Inc. - PETM - close: 10.32 change: +0.06 stop: 9.49

Company Description
PETsMART, Inc., is the largest specialty retailer of services and
solutions for the lifetime needs of pets. The Phoenix, AZ-based
company operates more than 550 pet stores in the United States
and Canada, as well as a large pet supply catalog business, and
is the major, controlling investor in the Internet's leading
online provider of pet products and information
(www.petsmart.com).  PETsMART provides a broad range of
competitively priced pet food and supplies, and offers complete
pet training, grooming and adoption services. (source: company
press release)

Why We Like It:
One glance at the chart of PETM and it is easy to see why
investors might be drawn to the stock.  Fortunately, it would
appear that PETM actually has some earnings to back up this
amazing rise in its stock price.  For many investors, 2001 was
not a fun year in the stock market.  Yet for PETM shareholders
they saw a $2.60 share price near its March 2001 lows rise to the
$10.00 level by the end of December 2001.  Management seems to
have good control over some of the challenges of running a 550
store chain while still keeping growth as part of the equation.

PETsMART's latest earnings report, which was for its Q3, came out
back in November but inside there was plenty of information that
investors liked to hear.  We've grabbed a quote from their Q3
earnings press release: ""Improvements in key areas such as in-
stocks, inventory management and distribution efficiency, coupled
with the continued growth in our pet services business, drove
sales and profitability during the third quarter,"" said Phil
Francis, chairman, president and chief executive officer of
PETsMART, Inc. ""We've gained a good deal of momentum, and are
positioned for a solid fourth quarter and a strong 2002, when
we'll bring our new store format to 200 existing stores, open 25
to 30 new stores, and continue to drive a company-wide culture of
customer care.""

Phil has reason to be positive if the company's numbers keep up
their current pace.  The same Q3 report showed that gross margins
had risen to 28.6 percent, up 390 basis points compared with the
third quarter the year before.  Total sales for the quarter had
jumped 10.6% to $598.6 million while comparable store sales added
7.6 percent over the Q3 of 2000.

The company recently announced that they had bought the remaining
16.3 percent interest in PETsMART.com that they didn't own for
$9.5 million.  In addition to the purchase they would consolidate
the dot.com business and their PETsMART Direct, an equine direct
marketing business, into their overall operations.  Part of this
plan would close certain offices in California and move the
operations to their Phoenix, AZ headquarters.

This announcement came out after the bell on Tuesday, January
22nd and investors were unsure how to interpret the news, which
caused some volatility in the stock price the next day.  Since
then we've seen some selling in the stock but we feel the pull
back towards the $10 level has merely offered us a better entry
point.

On a positive note, the same announcement revealed that the
company had raised their sales growth outlook for the January
quarter from 6 to 7 percent to about 9 percent.  We could not
confirm an actual date but believe PETM will announce its Q4
earnings in late February.

How do we trade the stock from here?

It would be easy to say that on a longer-term basis the stock
could be considered overbought.  However, in this current market
environment where investors are asking, ""show me the earnings""
PETM should continue to draw investor interest.  There aren't
many companies right now with strong sales growth and growing
profit margins.  Technically, buyers have been supporting the
stock price every time it dips to the 30-dma during the last
three months (from Nov. 1st).  Shares dipped below this level
mid-week but quickly rebounded.  At the moment, the 30-dma is
near the $10 mark, which can also double as a strong
psychological support level.

We're going to start the play with a stop loss at $9.49, which is
a few cents below the 50-dma but we're only giving the stock this
extra room because we have a two to three month time frame.  More
conservative traders or short-term traders could easily use a
tighter stop loss.  One suggestion would be to place a stop under
Wednesday's low of $9.84.

PETM does have some overhead resistance at the $11 level but the
overall bullish trend should be able to conquer it.  Our
objective is a $12 price target.  This is almost 20% above
current levels.  We suspect that America's new tendency to stay
home and spend money on the house and the family will also
translate into more money on the family pet.

Picked on January 25th at $10.32

=================================================================
Tech Stock of the Month for Tech Bulls
=================================================================

Cognos Inc. - COGN - close: 25.47 change: +0.48 stop: 23.70

Company Description:
Cognos is the leading global provider of business intelligence
solutions that optimize the performance of the world's largest
and most successful organizations. Founded in 1969, Cognos does
business with more than 19,000 customers in 120 countries around
the world. Cognos business intelligence solutions and services
are also available from more than 3,000 worldwide partners and
resellers. (source: company press release)

Why We Like It:
The software sector has been a jumpy group lately and we're not
seeing a lot of leadership with MSFT trading below its 200-dma.
However, we have noticed a few players in the ""business
solutions"" group doing okay.  One of those is Cognos Inc.  Shares
of the stock have done very well the last few months and really
jumped higher in December after their Q3 earnings report.  The
stock ran into heavy resistance at the $27 level in early January
but has since consolidated back to the $24 mark with a nice
intraday dip last Wednesday.  Volume was pretty strong on Friday
as bulls pushed shares up almost 2% heading into the weekend.  In
the news, First Albany Corp. recently upgraded COGN to a ""buy""
and gave it a $30 price target.  First Albany cited the recent
earnings improvement over the last two quarters and a decent
entry point supporting a decent risk/reward scenario in COGN.  We
happen to agree with them on the entry point idea and don't mind
targeting the $30 level either.  There is still a wall at $27 but
hopefully this time COGN will be able to trade through it.  We
are going to start the play with a stop at $23.70, which is
Wednesday's low.  We still recommend keeping an eye on MSFT and
the GSO.X software index to gauge the market atmosphere.

Picked on January 25th at $25.47
Change since picked:       +0.00
Earnings Date           04/10/02 (unconfirmed)

"FW: Summary RTO Week Day 2 -- Planning & Expansion","

 


  RTO Week
Day 2 -- October 16, 2001
Transmission Planning & Expansion
The afternoon panel discussed transmission planning and expansion. The panelists were: Jose Degado--CEO American Transmission Company, Michael Dworkin--Chair Vermont PSC, Mark Maher--VP Transmission Business Line, Bonneville Power Administration, Lara Manz--PSE&G, Masheed Rosenqvist--National Grid, Steve Walton--Enron.
General Observations
The Commissioners were all present although the did leave and return from time to time.  Commissioner's Breathitt and Massey were the most active in questioning.  The FERC Staff were active in asking questions after the initial presentations, moving along the discussion by asking questions.  There was some reference to the morning discussion of congestion management, however, there was no discussion of the merits of the various types of transmission rights.  There was a good deal of consensus around the concept of the RTO Planning Process being first a provider of information to the market (where are problems, how might they be solved, etc.) and that the where possible that expansion be funded by market participants who would benefit.  There was a good deal of discussion of ""least cost planning"" and the identification of options which are not transmission related.  All agreed there had to be backstop authority to build transmission, however then the challenge is who pays for it, which raises the need for dispute resolution.  
Opening Statements
Jose Delgado: ATC is a transmission only company with MISO as the system operator.  They view everyone as a customer whose needs are to be met.  They were formed by divestiture by IOUS, coops and munis and with a $500 million asset base initially. Their current ten year plan will add $1billion of investment.   Their top priorities are connecting generation and load.  
Michael Dworkin: Because transmission is a common good, construction affects all parties not just one party.  The environmental and permitting of lines requires a balance of benefits with costs and a long range view.  The idea of joint boards should be considered for dealing with multi-state projects, although FERC has show little interest in joint boards they have been used by FCC.  State input needed because of the local needs and impacts which must be considered.
Mark Maher: FERC must consider the unique characteristics of the West when considering congestion management.  LMP is not a good fit to hydro systems with their multiple use obligations.  RTO West is developing a planning process which will give the RTO the freedom to develop options as we learn in the future.  The RTO needs a strong centralized planning process.
Laura Manz: The various aspects of planning are connected.  Pricing (LMP) is the key to getting the right signals for expansion of transmission and resources.   No competitor should have an advantage over another.  The RTO needs a central planning process but it shouldn't push solutions.  The market should decide on solutions.  
Masheed Rosenqvist: The morning discussion of congestion management talked about hedging against risk.  The planning discussion is not about what we have now, but about how to avoid future congestion.  The Commission has taken conflicting positions in different cases.  The issues that need to be answered are:  How can merchant transmission be compensated?  Should transmission projects be open to RFPs?  Is FERC open to market based pricing for expansions?  
Steve Walton:  The most important thing for FERC to do for expansion is to settle the matter of industry structure do away with the uncertainty that has frozen transmission investment.  The RTO debate has been going on for 5 years or more and needs to be settled.  For expansion to go forward, there needs to be a clear property right which accrues to the expanding party.  You are always going to have muddy issues in planning.  For instance if a 138 kV line is all that is needed to day, but future considerations of scare right-of-way say a 345 kV line should be built, who pays for the extra cost.  In order to resolve such matters the planning process must include a dispute resolution process, appeal able to FERC, to decide such matters.
Discussion
Kevin Kelly asked about he fact that some parties benefit form current congestion so how does a stakeholder process get things built when some oppose.  Most agreed that if a party wants to fund construction it should be built with the beneficiaries funding.  Michael Dworkin expressed concerns about use of eminent domain to build which means a benefit test must exist to say this is the best solution, i.e. least cost planning.  This lead to discussion of the need for the RTO to be provider of information to all parties so they can make intelligent decisions.  
Commissioner Massey asked about whether the system was (a) under built and needed lots of expansion so don't worry about overbuilding or (b) transmission planning should consider all options before construction of new facilities.  The panel agreed that pricing needs to be a prime determinant in the process.  Michaela Dworkin worried that overbuilding distorts decisions.  Laura Manz felt that the term ""under built"" is a secondary effect of not having proper pricing of locational prices to guide parties.
Dick O'Neil asked if LMP will work in the West.  Mark Maher said it wouldn't.  Laura Manz said it applies everywhere because of physics, they manage hydro facilities in PJM.  Michael Dworkin said LMP means an explicit measure of cost of congestion and the value of generation at locations and ought not to be rejected just intelligently designed.  BPA is looking pricing model but LMP won't work.  Steve Walton said LMP needed for real time dispatch, but given the nature of the Northwest hydro system it must have some ""tweaks"" like bilaterals and allow operator self-schedule output levels to permit  river coordination.  Hydro system optimizes over weeks and months to maximize firm energy production not on an hour to hour basis.  PJM has hydro, but not 70% as in the Northwest.  Implementation will be different because such thing as unit commitment are different when you have primarily hydro and base load coal.
In the summation at the end of the panel, four principles were listed:  (1) RTO must provide information, (2) RTO should identify solutions, (3) RTO should be unbiased and (4) the RTO should be accountable.  The disagreement was over the last two points, Michael Dworkin felt that #3 (unbiased) was critical and that #4 (accountability) was accomplished by having regulators involved in governance.  Jose Delgado said and Transco can't be unbiased since it provides services, although the ISO above it can be, but accountability is based on loosing your investment if you make an mistake.  This last point really comes down to a preference for ISO over Transco forms and the tension which exist because unbiased and accountability issues.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here      Player Updates NFL Reports   [IMAGE] Latest NFL Player News    Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/24/01   Five weeks removed from arthroscopic knee surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise Wednesday when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season.   ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said.   Davis admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report.      Amani Toomer  , WR NYG - Kens Killers Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.     Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.    Bert Emanuel  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up.    Hines Ward  , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/24/01   The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/24/01   Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Robinson  , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Neil Rackers  , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.    Todd Pinkston  , WR PHI - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/24/01   Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.    Joe Jurevicius  , WR NYG - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury.     Raghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game.     Ricky Watters  , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Trent Dilfer  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.    Matt Hasselbeck  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/23/01   The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MIA - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/23/01   Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.    Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/23/01   Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Commissioner Updated 10/23/01   Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.    Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/23/01   Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.    More Updates    Player News Teams   [IMAGE]   Carsons Wildcats Player News    Germane Crowell  , Reserve WR Updated 10/24/01  The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.    Rob Moore  , Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01  According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season game this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. ""I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republic . ""That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him."" If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go.    Freddie Jones  , Active TE Updated 10/22/01  Jones sprained his ankle against Denver. His current status is day to day.    Michael Pittman  , Active RB Updated 10/21/01  Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.    LaDainian Tomlinson  , Active RB Updated 10/21/01  Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.    Ahman Green  , Reserve RB Updated 10/19/01  Green will get the bulk of his numbers in the second half if Green Bay can get ahead of Minnesota early. He will definitely be good for at least one TD.    Shannon Sharpe  , Active TE Updated 10/19/01  Expect Sharpe to have another solid week, as far as tight ends are concerned. He is the team's leader in receptions and should get a reasonable amount of balls thrown his way. Don't be surprised if he scores a touchdown as well. Sharpe is overdue for a score. He had five TD catches in 2000 but hasn't scored one this season.    Kurt Warner  , Active QB Updated 10/18/01  Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.    Torry Holt  , Active WR Updated 10/18/01  Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.    Mark Brunell  , Reserve QB Updated 10/17/01  Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score.    Vikings  , Reserve DT Updated 09/26/01  The Vikings signed former Buffalo safety Henry Jones this week. He'll replace Robert Griffith, who broke his leg during Sunday's game against Chicago. The move won't make Minnesota's secondary much better than it was, however, and doesn't improve the unit overall from a Fantasy perspective.    Steve Christie  , Reserve K Updated 09/11/01  According to published reports, Christie has been released by the Buffalo Bills. Christie, who was placed on injured reserve due to a groin injury last week, will have an MRI on Tuesday. Drop Christie now if you haven't already done so, and consider picking up Jake Arians, who has taken over the placekicking duties in Buffalo.    Travis Prentice  , Reserve RB Updated 09/03/01  Prentice was traded to the Vikings, where he might see some work as a No. 2 RB, at best. He's not worth a Fantasy draft choice right now.    Rams  , Active DT Updated 08/30/01  Head Coach Mike Martz announced that safeties Kim Herring (hamstring) and Adam Archuleta (hamstring), linebackers Mark Fields (thigh) and London Fletcher (hamstring) and CB Aeneas Williams (back) will be held out of the Rams' final preseason game. However, they will all be ready for the season opener against Philadelphia on September 9. The Rams defense is worth a late-round selection on Draft Day.    Matt Stover  , Active K Updated 12/08/00  Stover needs just nine more field goals over the final three weeks of the season to break the NFL single-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999). Expect him to get plenty of chances against San Diego on Sunday, and ensure that he's in your active playoff lineup each week.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

Brought to you by   Sponsorship Bar You are receiving these e-reports because you have signed up for CBS SportsLine.com Fantasy Football.  To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/24/01 Davis is scheduled to return against the Miami Dolphins on Dec. 2. He has missed the past two games while recovering from his second arthroscopic surgery this year.   Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 11/24/01 Gary will be out for the rest of the season. He broke a bone in his left leg during Thursday's game.   Darnay Scott , WR CIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Scott has been listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week.   James Allen , RB CHI - Powers Rangers Updated 11/23/01 With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11.   Anthony Thomas! , RB CHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/23/01According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 11/23/01 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 The Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.    James Stewart , RB DET - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Damons Doormats Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain.    Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia.  He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback.    Rod Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.  ! Olandis Gary  , RB DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 11/23/01 Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01! The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Commissioner Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Feeleys Fanat! ic! s Updated 11/21/01 Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Damons Doormats Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or N! ut! s Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good! F! antasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Michael,  The Washington bureau will bring us more on the EPA decision to recommend changes to the nation's fuel specifications on Thursday. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the proposal to reduce the number of boutique fuels across the country will likely draw mixed reaction.   We'll have the latest on energy legislation from the Senate.  There continues to be mixed signals coming from both parties on the likelihood of a deal that could pave the way for a comprehensive energy bill to reach the floor.     Also in Washington, a long list of energy influentials will speak at the Alliance to Save Energy's Summit on Energy Efficiency.  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman and S. David Freeman, the Chairman of California's new state power authority are among the scheduled participants.  We'll have coverage of the Summit from the Washington bureau on Thursday.   Houston has long been called the energy capital of the world and downtown Houston has always been considered the energy corridor.  Now the Woodlands, a community located north of Houston, is staking its claim as the next energy corridor of the area.  On Thursday the Woodlands Chamber of Commerce is hosting an energy forum to discuss the area's growth and ways to attract more companies.  We'll bring you details from the Houston bureau tomorrow.   We'll take a rare look Thursday into the largest nuclear power plant in Texas.  South Texas Project Electric Generating Station invited members of the news media to tour secured areas as nuclear plants around the country upgrade security in light of the threats and attacks on America.    Also from the Houston bureau on Thursday, Simmons & Company International Vice President of Research Mark Meyer will drop by to discuss how oil stocks are doing this quarter.  Catch Meyer during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast.   The California Public Utilities Commission is meeting on Thursday.  West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the agenda may include the Rate Agreement between the CDWR and the PUC along with the issue of Direct Access.     Kym also reports, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District is boosting its capacity.  This move will add to what is already the largest utility-owned distributed photovoltaic system in the world.  Kym will bring us details on Thursday.   Finally from the West Coast bureau, we'll have comments from California Governor Gray Davis' Press Secretary Steve Maviglio on the federal government's plans to expand Path 15.  Join us for these stories from the West Coast bureau tomorrow.   From ENL Headquarters on Thursday, Williams Energy Partners L.P. Chief Financial Officer Don Wellendorf will join us to discuss the company's third-quarter earnings.  And Edward Jones Senior Energy Analyst Zach Wagner will join us from St. Louis to continue the discussion on earnings.  Wagner will discuss Enron during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Two SuperBowls For OTC Journal Members","If you are reading this message in plaintext or if you have an AOL address you must click on this link: http://listserv.otcjournal.com/otcjournal/20020201-1.html  and wait for a web page to automatically open up to properly read this newsletter.

  [IMAGE] February 1, 2002 [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] Volume V, Issue 9 [IMAGE]     Email : info@otcjournal.com   URL : http://www.otcjournal.com    To OTC Journal Members:      [IMAGE] For OTC Journal Members There Will Be Two SuperBowls   This Sunday the St. Louis Rams will square off against the New England Patriots in the most watched television event of the year. The Superbowl is the single most hyped sporting event, and hopefully this year it will be a good game. Hundreds of millions of viewers world wide will have their televisions tuned in to this event.   The St. Louis Rams are favored by two touchdowns, and most odds makers give the Patriots no chance. The SuperBowl has a well deserved reputation for being a blowout, with the outcome decided by the end of the first half. It's like the Presidential election. The media decides the outcome with only about 10% of the score being counted. Hopefully this year's SuperBowl will prove as close and entertaining as the last Presidential Election. Maybe the Supreme Court will have to decide the winner.   SuperBowl fans know the commercials can be the most exciting part of the telecast. Advertisers go all out in a creative competition as they have the opportunity to get their message to largest imaginable audience.   Fans of the OTC Journal will have the opportunity to watch one SuperBowl this weekend, and play in one next week. As we continue to remind you, our next profile will come out toward the end of next week, and we believe this stock will be the SuperBowl of small cap stocks for our members.   The stock will begin trading sometime between Wednesday and Friday, and check our home page frequently for an update. As soon as the stock opens for trading we will hit the send button on the mail server. It will take about six hours for the newsletter to deploy, and as always there can be technology delays on the Internet.   However, the banner on our home page will update you automatically, and you will be able to simply click on it to read the profile when the stock opens for trading. Hopefully we will be able to provide a more precise time frame in an edition early next week.     [IMAGE] Small And MicroCap Stocks Avoid Wall Street Carnage This Week [IMAGE]  The latest GDP and Unemployment figures came out stronger than expected this week, leading investors to believe the end of the recession is right on schedule.   However, this good news was overshadowed by scandal related selling early in the week. The Dow and Nasdaq were clobbered early in the week, slipping below 9700 and 1900 respectively.   The thinking on Wall Street was dominated by the belief that the Enron accounting scandal was just the tip of the iceberg, and other company's financial statements would come under increased scrutiny.    Behemoth multi national Tyco (NYSE: TYC) was annihilated early in the week on fears they have been cooking the books. It was disclosed one of their directors received a $20 million payment for arranging an acquisition. Many feel this was a blatant conflict of interest.   Telecommunications giant Global Crossing (NYSE: GX) filed bankruptcy this week. Chairman Gary Winnick has taken $600 million off the table personally in the last five years. Quite a reward for failure.   Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC) announced a $1.7 billion non cash charge to earnings in order to correct previous accounting issues. The stock fell nearly 8% on the news.   ImClone Systems (NASDAQ: IMCL) is being investigated by the SEC and the Justice Department. The company is accused of misleading investors on the highly touted colon cancer drug Erbitux. CEO Samuel Waksal told investors on a conference call that he was ""stunned'' at the FDA's decision to refuse the cancer drug application for Erbitux. However a copy of the FDA's rejection letter was obtained by The Cancer Letter. It suggests Waksal and his brother Harlan knew, or should have known, that the FDA had serious concerns about the way the company conducted a key clinical trial. Harlan Waksal filed a Form 144 with the SEC on Dec. 6 to sell $52 million worth of ImClone stock.   Wall Street is afraid earnings and accounting scandals will dominate financial news for some time to come. Arthur Andersen generated $50 million in accounting fees from Enron last year, and companies like Enron have a lot of muscle with their auditors. In order to win the business, the consulting arm comes up with the tax avoidance scheme and earnings enhancement method, and the auditing division implements the strategy.    Like a weight lifter taking steroids, large cap companies are addicted to beefing up their financial performance at any cost. And just like the weightlifter taking steroids, this performance enhancement is not only toxic long term, it is also illegal.   In the small and micro cap arena there is significant risk associated with failed corporate performance. However, these smaller companies do not have the fiscal muscle to make their auditors bend the rules to enhance financial performance. You won't see many small company scandals associated with accounting irregularities. Their auditors take a much more conservative approach, as the auditor is more concerned with covering his own butt than collecting the reduced fees.   During this past week, while Wall Street was annihilating several of its large cap favorites, Cross Media (AMEX: XMM) and Energy Power (OTC BB: EYPSF) both traded up. Small stocks still remain a preferred and level playing field for individual investors.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Michael,  We're going to make it through the winter - the North American Electric Reliability Council released its Winter Assessment on Tuesday, reporting that generating supply should meet or exceed estimated energy consumption.  The Washington bureau will take a closer look at the assessment on Wednesday.   On Wednesday, Interior Secretary Gale Norton talks about the upcoming Lease Area 181 sale.  Secretary Norton believes there's still great interest in the sale despite the reduction in size of the lease area.  The sale is scheduled to take place in New Orleans on December 5.   The FERC announced sweeping changes on Tuesday in how it looks at the issue of market power.  The changes could have a big impact on major power generators.  We'll have reaction from the Washington bureau on Wednesday from Megawatt Daily Editor Michael Lustig and Electric Power Supply Association President Lynne Church.  Lustig joins us during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast and Church is stopping by at  10:00 a.m. ET.   ENL's Kym McNicholas will also have reaction to Tuesday's FERC ruling.  On Wednesday, she'll bring us comments from Mirant, the California Department of Water Resources and the California ISO.  And during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast, Independent Energy Producers Association State Policy Manager Katie Kaplan will join us from the West Coast bureau to give us her take on the FERC's actions.   Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission Regional Manager Leonard Spearman is stopping by the Houston bureau on Wednesday. He'll talk about the TNRCC's role in strengthening homeland security at Texas petrochemical plants and refineries.  Catch the Spearman interview during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   The Houston bureau will also bring us a new twist in the search for alternatives to MTBE.  Chris Paschall of Industry Information Resources will talk about the possibility of making ethanol out of wine vines - potential good news for California.  Join us from Houston on Wednesday.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Some club news - As I have said before, Ken and I are  ""retiring"" (after the Kansas Klash) from our leadership role in the  Houston club.  We have enjoyed it all but feel it is time for some new  ideas and new outlook.  And time for us to do other things!

We are so pleased to have  Aaron, Angie and Amber take over the core committee and the club  activities.  I guess we could call them the Triple A's - they are coming to  the rescue.  Thanks again for your support all these years. Hope you can  come to the Kansas Klash and meet the Triple A's!

>
>        MANHATTAN, Kan. - Junior center Pervis Pasco had 30 points
>and 11 points to lead Kansas State to an 84-70 victory over North
>Texas in a men's college basketball game played Saturday at Bramlage
>Coliseum.
>        The win snapped a two-game losing streak by the Wildcats and
>lifted them to 5-3 overall. The Mean Green fell to 1-6 on the year
>after losing their sixth straight.
>        Pasco, who also had five blocked shots, hit 11 of 17 shots
>from the floor to lead the Wildcats. Nick Williams chipped in with 19
>points, while Larry Reid finished with 13 points, eight assists and
>seven rebounds.
>        Junior guard Chris Davis led North Texas with 28 points and
>nine rebounds, hitting 11 of 21 shots from the floor. He also had
>three three-pointers for the Mean Green, which got 10 points off the
>bench from Unjel Masters.
>        Kansas State went on an 11-1 run midway through the first
>half to take a 22-18 lead with 7:20 left. The lead grew through the
>rest of the half, and the Wildcats went to halftime with a 44-33
>halftime edge behind 15 points from Pasco.
>        K-State's advantage grew to 20 at 56-36 in the opening five
>minutes of the second half before the Mean Green started a slow
>comeback. North Texas cut the deficit under double figures to trail
>73-64 with 4:03 to play. But K-State hit 7 of its final 8 free throws
>in the final 3:50 to seal the win.
>        Pasco's previous season-high was 16 points, scored against
>Gardner-Webb. The double-double was his second of the season and his
>second straight, as he had 15 points and 10 boards at Northwestern
>last Saturday.
>        Williams also had a season-high for K-State, eclipsing the 15
>points he had scored at Northwestern.
>        K-State committed only eight turnovers in the game and
>finished with a 47 percent shooting mark from the field. North Texas
>was held to just 40 percent shooting from the floor.

How Does He Do It?

A former computer specialist and high-tech venture capitalist,
Steve Harmon knows the ins & outs of the technology business --
and he sees things that most financial advisors and investors
miss. Broadband Investor deciphers the confusion, chaos and
disruption in the complex but lucrative sectors for today's
investors.

Harmon focuses on companies with the strongest fundamentals,
like market leadership, sales and earnings growth, sector
potential, and management strength. And he steers clear of
momentum darlings that run on hot air but deflate quickly
when speculators run away.

See for yourself why Investors Chronicle calls Steve Harmon
""One of the top 10 online commentators."" Why Smart Money lauds
him as ""One of three rising stars in technology investing.""

"BCP Seat Assignments","All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

Regards,

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Employee Meeting Postponed","We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Michael,  Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) says he is unsure whether an energy bill will reach the Senate floor this year.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says Senator Bingaman is also downplaying the chances that a new Republican energy proposal will alter the debate significantly.  The bureau will have the latest from the Hill on Friday.   Also from Washington on Friday, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency Robert Priddle will discuss the world's energy supply within the context of the campaign against terrorism.  Priddle is speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies tomorrow, and the Washington bureau will bring us all the details.     Energy Markets Washington Editor Jack Belcher will join us from the Washington bureau on Friday.  Belcher is stopping by during the  9:00 a.m. ET newscast to discuss the EPA's new boutique fuels proposal.   The Independent Petroleum Association of America will continue a three-day meeting in Houston on Friday.  Interior Secretary  Gale Norton and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham are among those attending the meeting.  Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will have details on the meeting from the Houston bureau on Friday.   Also from Houston, Spinnaker Exploration CEO and Founder  Roger Jarvis will discuss his company's third-quarter earnings results.  Join us during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast for the Jarvis interview.  And catch Simmons & Company International Vice President of Research  Mark Meyer as he talks about how oil stocks are doing this quarter.  We'll bring you these interviews from Houston on Friday.       From the West Coast bureau on Friday, ENL's Kym McNicholas will bring us a report on the extra security measures being taken to protect the Hoover Dam.  The dam has 17 generators, each capable of supplying electricity to 100,000 households.  Catch the Hoover Dam report from the West Coast bureau tomorrow.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

  [IMAGE] December 23, 2001 [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] Volume IV, Issue 109 [IMAGE]     Email : info@otcjournal.com   URL : http://www.otcjournal.com    To OTC Journal Members:      [IMAGE] ""Twas the night before Christmas....""    [IMAGE]  In December of 1822 a poem was written by a literature professor at Columbia College (now University) to amuse his children.   The poem was originally entitled ""A Visit From St. Nicholas"". One year later it was published anonymously in the Troy Sentinel, submitted without the author's knowledge by a house guest who obtained a copy.   A New York publisher later issued the poem, and was advised nearly universally by critics of the time that it was a waste of paper and ink.   However, as usual the critics were wrong. This unheralded verse managed to hang on, and after the author's death it was illustrated with drawings from Thomas Nast and became very famous.   The author was Clement Clarke Moore, and the poem began with the phrase ""Twas the night before Christmas....""   So much for the critics. Have a wonderful Christmas. Remember, the gifts that are around you are more precious than the gifts you unwrap.     [IMAGE] Envoy Communications (NASDAQ: ECGI) Announces Year End Results- Santa in Nowhere to be Found [IMAGE]    Over the Long Term Market Price Action Always Tells You What's Happening Even When the Company Doesn't, and the Market is Rarely Wrong.  The Editors of the OTC Journal  [IMAGE]  Envoy Communications held a conference call this past week to discuss its fiscal year end results (end of September). Santa was nowhere to be found. Based on what we learned from the call the stock has dropped from the mid $4 range to just under $1 in the past year because it deserved to.   The company revealed an abdominal 4th quarter where they lost $2.2 million EBITDA. Although they ended the year with just over $80 million in revenues (up 38%) and about $7 million in EBITDA profits (down 30%), the trend towards losses is very disturbing.   We have been in a tough market environment for many companies, and Envoy has not been left out. Of the $2.2 million the company lost in the 4th quarter, $.5 million is attributed to shutting down the Communiqu? division, and $1 million was attributed to Sage Consulting, their technology division which will probably continue to lose money.   The only bright spot was the performance of Watt Group, their International design and consulting firm. Watt is profitable and now represents 50% of the company's ongoing revenue stream.   As seen in the chart, the recent rebound in the stock has dramatically reversed course as a result of this disclosure. In our last edition on Envoy we felt the stock was destined for higher levels. In the short term, this past week's financial disclosure sabotaged our prediction. Sadly, we were wrong. It's not the first time and it won't be the last.   However, these financial results are a snapshot of the past. We are concerned with the future. In the conference call the company indicated they expected to make $8.6 million in EBITDA profits next year.   December quarterly numbers are expected to be lackluster, and they are expecting improvements in the March and June quarters.   The editors of the OTC Journal are very disappointed that management never gave any ongoing public disclosure concerning their 4th quarter performance. Many companies are falling on hard times, but most of them are choosing to inform the public as disappointments occur.   It is evident from the performance of the stock that someone knew the company was doing so poorly. Unfortunately, it wasn't us.   We still believe the stock will rebound to the $2 level, although it may take some time. Recent new contract wins have resulted in surges in the stock price, suggesting the market wants to believe again.   In the next week the stock may suffer from the final week of potential tax selling. If you see the stock down near $1 it should be bought for a January rebound.

"RE: Regional Research Projects","Boys, 

I'd be delighted to gather and format all of the information for a ""nice and pretty"" presentation. I would just ask that you e-mail me your info by the end of Wednesday, Feb. 6.

All,

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from ""ambushes"" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.

Please note that, as a result, we may ""only"" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions.  Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in the information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your name.  Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them finished by next Thurs. (2/7).  Someone please nominate yourself to format each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder nice and pretty.  Have a goodie.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"Big Brothers/Big Sisters-Bowl for Kid's Sake 2002","Hello all:

The time has come again for Bowl for Kid's Sake!  Entergy-Koch is sponsoring
the event this year which will raise money for the children of Big
Brothers-Big Sisters of Greater Houston.  BBBS offers youth mentoring
programs to at-risk children, and their goal is to match children from
single-parent families with responsible, adult role models.

Last year, our team raised over $1500, and this year our team goal is $3000.
The company goal is to raise $350,000 in total.  The minimum pledge per pin
is $.10 (100 score minimum), or a flat pledge of $10.  Either method works,
but be careful on the pledge per pin donation (I have been studying the
moves of Roy Munson and Ernie McCracken from the movie Kingpin).

If you are interested, please reply with your phone number, address, and
pledge amount (you will be billed directly in the mail by BBBS).

For those of you who are also interested in supporting our efforts in
person, the fundraiser will take place on Thursday, March 7th  from
2:00-4:30 at Palace Lanes, 4191 Bellaire Blvd (713-667-6554).

Thanks again to those who could contribute last year.  We hope to have just
as much success this time!

"Enron response in Dynegy v. ComEd","Attached is Enron's response against Dynegy's argument that Firm LD contracts cannot be used as designated sources for network transmission pursuant to the FERC OATT.  ComEd allows firm LD contracts to be designated as network resources on a day ahead basis for the Illinois retail program.  Dynegy argues that only ""capacity"" contracts should be allowed and ComEd's practice deprived Dynegy of at least $2-4 MM of hypothetical capacity payments over the past two years.  Also, attached are responses from other participants, including the Illinois Commerce Commission in favor of the practice.  

Currently, not all transmission providers follow ComEd's practice.  While we are arguing that FERC policy allows Firm LD products to be used as network resources, please check with us before assuming that other TPs will allow this (pending a FERC order in this case).

His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against! a! decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Commissioner Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/21/01Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Damons Doormats Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has ! be! en somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/21/01 The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.  Stephen Alexander  , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 According to the Washington Post, Alexander will be back in the starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a gamble.   Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't recommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this is the game he will break his slump.  Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Carsons Wildcats ! Updated 11/21/01 Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/21/01 McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore, and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for explosive stats.  Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/21/01 Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes than most receivers in the league.  Elvis Joseph , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this week if you have no other options at running ba! ck!   Marcus Pollard , TE IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However, you should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday against San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way and post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.  Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent. However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer downfield for great stats this week.  Dominic Rhodes , RB IND - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats, but should give good rushing totals and a score.  Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Clark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in recent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game Thursday against Dallas.

"FW: Update on RTOs -- Today's FERC meeting","

Subject:	Update on RTOs -- Today's FERC meeting

TJ and Claudette -- please forward to your groups:


FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing ""certainty"" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

Subject:	**IMPORTANT** Stack Manager Users
Importance:	High


We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game.    Derrick Alexander  , WR KC - Damons Doormats Updated 10/25/01   Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets.    James Hodgins  , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy.     Dave Stachelski  , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this season for five yards.     Michael Bennett  , RB MIN - Powers Rangers Updated 10/25/01   Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any indication that he will use Bennett this week.     Todd Heap  , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week.     Anthony Thomas  , RB CHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/25/01   Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as probable on the injury report.     Kevin Swayne  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet. Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is healthy.     Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Ward has been ruled out of Sunday's game at Seattle. He is still recovering from a foot injury.     Terry Allen  , RB BAL - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/25/01   Allen practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for this week's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . Jason Brookins will start Sunday if Allen is inactive.     Jason Brookins  , RB BAL - Commissioner Updated 10/25/01   Brookins has a minor shoulder injury but is expected to play this Sunday. He might actually start this week in place of the injured Terry Allen. Nevertheless, he is listed as probable on the injury report.     Shannon Sharpe  , TE BAL - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/25/01   Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable on the injury report.     Freddie Jones  , TE SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/25/01   Jones has a sprained ankle but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as questionable on the injury report.     Hines Ward  , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Ward missed practice Wednesday because of a foot injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed on the injury report as probable.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Galloway's status for Sunday's game will be determined after Thursday's practice. He is suffering from a foot injury that he suffered in the Cowboys' previous game.     Charlie Batch  , QB DET - Damons Doormats Updated 10/25/01   Batch was given the day off Wednesday, because of a sore arm. However, The Detroit Free Press reports that he is still expected to play Sunday against the Bengals.     O.J. McDuffie  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Don't expect McDuffie to play again this season. The Miami Herald reports that he is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as well because of the injury.     Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Commissioner Updated 10/25/01   Wilkins will not play in Sunday's game. He has been ruled out because of broken ribs.     Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/25/01   Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the starting lineup.     Terry Glenn  , WR NE - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/25/01   Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to The Boston Globe . He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg holds up before activating him Sunday.     Drew Bledsoe  , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still under his playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual passing drills.     Chad Morton  , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Morton might be able to play this Sunday, according to The Bergen Record . He has missed the past three games because of an ankle sprain.     Marco Battaglia  , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit.     Chad Johnson  , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his absence.     Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy.     Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/25/01   Wheatley did not practice Wednesday because of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon Gruden told The Contra Costa Times that he is making progress. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Eagles.     Keyshawn Johnson  , WR TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/25/01   Johnson ran in the morning and afternoon but did not practice Wednesday, according to The St. Petersburg Times . Johnson is recovering from hip and thigh injuries but is expected to play Sunday.     Jacquez Green  , WR TB - Kens Killers Updated 10/25/01   Green is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Minnesota. He is recovering from a groin strain. Frank Murphy will replace Green at receiver if he is unable to play.     Warrick Dunn  , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/25/01   Dunn participated in running drills Wednesday and did not have any setbacks in his recovery from a toe injury, according to The St. Petersburg Times . Nevertheless, Dunn is still listed as questionable for this week's game against Minnesota.

>>HOT SHOOTING CARRIES 11TH-RANKED WILDCATS TO VICTORY
>>
>>        MANHATTAN, Kan. - Nicole Ohlde had team-highs of 24 points,
>>11 rebounds and eight assists to lift 11th-ranked Kansas State to a
>>76-63 victory over No. 12 Texas Tech in a Big 12 Conference women's
>>basketball game played Sunday before a sellout crowd of 13,340 at
>>Bramlage Coliseum.
>>        The victory improved the Wildcats to 19-2 overall and 7-1 in
>>the league. K-State has won all 10 home games it has played this
>>season. The Lady Raiders fell to 12-6 overall and 4-4 in the Big 12
>>and had a three-game winning streak snapped that included wins over a
>>pair of ranked teams.
>>        Kansas State, which hit 18 of 22 shots (82 percent) from the
>>floor in the second half, put four players in double figures. Kristin
>>Rethman had 15 points, including a 4-for-5 effort from three-point
>>range, while Laurie Koehn had 13 points and Megan Mahoney added 11.
>>        Jia Perkins finished with 24 points for Tech, scoring 18 in
>>the first half. She went 1-for-8 in the second half after hitting 8
>>of her 12 shots before halftime. Casey Jackson added 11 points and 10
>>rebounds for the Lady Raiders.
>>        The game was tied at 41-41 with 15:20 remaining when the
>>Wildcats grabbed the lead for good on a bucket by Ohlde, who had 17
>>points on 8-for-8 shooting from the floor in the second half.
>>        K-State led 55-51 with 8:45 to play when back-to-back layups
>>by Mahoney gave the 'Cats an eight-point lead. The Raiders were
>>within 65-59 with 4:25 left when the Wildcats made their decisive
>>run. Shalondra Booker hit a three-pointer, Mahoney added a layup and
>>Ohlde scored on a three-point play to put K-State ahead 74-59 with
>>1:34 to play.
>>        Texas Tech held a 35-32 edge on the boards, but second-half
>>shooting was the difference in the game. While the Wildcats were hot
>>from the field after halftime, Tech managed just 27 percent shooting
>>from the floor, hitting just 9 of 34 shots.
>>        Rethman finished with five assists for Kansas State, while
>>Candi White had six and Perkins added five assists and five steals.
>>        Kansas State travels to 13th-ranked Texas on Wednesday before
>>returning home on Saturday, Feb. 2 to play No. 14 Iowa State. The
>>game against the Cyclones is also a sellout.

Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 12/20/01 Don't expect to see Grbac benched this year, or anytime soon, Brian Billick told the Baltimore Sun. ""He's my quarterback now, he's going to be my quarterback next year, hopefully the year after that and the year after that,"" Billick said.

------------------------------------------------------------
-



Military Resale Group, Inc. (OTCBB-MYRG) recently became a
""new"" publicly-owned company as a result of its
acquisition in December 2001 by Bactrol Technologies, Inc.
 MYRG markets and distributes groceries and related
products to commissaries on U.S. military bases in the
Colorado area, where our operating roots go back five
decades.  Previously a publicly-traded corporate shell,
Bactrol Technologies acquired Military Resale Group in a
reverse acquisition, leaving 6.6 million shares
outstanding and only 1.2 million shares in the public float.

MYRG was incorporated in 1997 when it acquired Pittock
Distributors, Inc., a fifty-year old firm specializing in
distribution of products to the Military Resale Market.
At the time of the acquisition of Pittock, it had
approximately $750,000 in revenue.  Revenue has increased
over five-fold (5x) in the past four years reaching $4.8
million in 2001.  MYRG believes that revenue can increase
to a $12 million annualized rate by the end of 2002 with
the existing facilities.  President Ethan Hokit and GM Bob
Hefner have each been in the local military resale market
for over 25 years.

The Military Resale Market is a $15 billion niche market
with 13,000,000 authorized patrons, which operates under
the aegis of the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), a
Department of Defense (DOD) agency. The DOD's objective,
in this activity, is to operate resale store systems that
sell groceries (at commissaries) and general merchandise
(at exchanges, i.e., PXs) at the lowest possible prices.
The resulting average cost savings last year of 30.4% make
the system a major fringe benefit (untaxed) to military
personnel. The competitive structure of the Military
Resale Market consists of a few large distributors that do
not dominate the industry, and hundreds of smaller
distributors. MYRG's long-term strategy is to grow,
primarily by acquiring other small distributors, and also
by internal growth.

Positive Investment Theme

1. The Military Resale Market for groceries-merchandise is
a $15 billion a year niche industry.
-13,000,000 authorized patrons benefit from lower prices
(about 30%) and on-post shopping convenience.
-Demand is cyclically stable due to the basic product
nature and military headcount.
-Distributors require some specialized knowledge - a
barrier to entry - in this industry regulated by DeCA
(Defense Commissary Agency).

2. The shares possess several appealing investment features.
A.	They are statistically attractive, as measured by the
Market Value/Sales Ratio.
-MYRG's market value is currently about $2.0 million.
This is only .4x actual 2001 sales of $4.8 million and
only .3x projected 2002 sales of about $6.5 million, which
is well below the level of the Market Value/Sales ratio
for most stocks.
B.	The float is thin, containing only 1.2 million shares.
C.	A stock play on the Military Resale Market is a ""new""
idea to investors and is defensive in a weaker economic
setting.

MYRG has set a target of reaching a trading range of $4.00
- $5.00 per share by year-end 2002 so that it can seek a
national exchange listing.

"URGENT - ENA Associates & Analysts"," 
All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Chris

As per your request, I examined the new SPP credit policy and creditworthness standards.

I tried to compare with previous versions, but I did not find any. I just encountered vague references on chapter 11 of the Open Acess Transmission Tariff document. Apparently, there is more posted on Oasis.

I contacted SPP and the response I got from Phil follows. He also copied Michael Jacobson.

Who else should receive this information? The new policy is effective December 15.

Thanks for your continued guidance.

Luiz,

I received your forwarded voice mail and email you had sent to Sherry
Jenson.  Thanks for looking at the credit policy.  The answer to your
question is that there has never been this much detail available on our
credit policy.  I would say to just use the one posted now would be the best
thing to do.

I did not know who would need to see the policy at your company so I sent
the following email to Michael Jacobson at your company.  If there is
anything further I can do for you feel free to let me know.

 Michael,

If you are not the proper person to receive this request will you please
forward it to the proper person within your organization.  

We have recently made significant changes to our credit policy and we have
requested all customers be compliant with the credit policy by December 15
of this year.  I have attached a copy of the credit policy reflecting these
changes for your review.  

After reviewing your company's last 24 calendar months of activity it would
appear that we will need a letter of credit in the amount of at least
$100,000 for you to be compliant with the terms of the policy.  Approved
language for the letter of credit is at the end of the credit policy as
attachment 2.  The issuing bank must also be acceptable to SPP and these
requirements can be located in the financial security section of the policy
under Letter of Credit.  Also, we have mailed and emailed the policy with a
request to send back the credit agreement.  I have also attached a copy of
this agreement.  If you would have it signed and sent back as well it would
be greatly appreciated.

Coach Mike Holmgren said Wednesday that Hasselbeck aggravated the injury, which he's had since the third week of the season, against the New York Giants last Sunday.   ""There's a chance I might have him and he could play in an emergency-type situation, but he's pretty sore,"" Holmgren said.    James Stewart , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Stewart is day to day with a sprained ankle. His status for this week's game is unclear.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/26/01 Graham may miss his second consecutive game this week because of the death of his father. With Tim Dwight (lung) still ailing, Trevor Gaylor may have to start again.   Skip Hicks , RB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Hicks is expected to miss this week's game with a hamstring injury, and may miss the rest of the season. Eddie George should assume a regular workload once again.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 12/26/01 Smith is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at this point of the postseason.    Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Bouman (thumb) may attempt to practice late in the week. His status remains unclear for this week's game, and Spergon Wynn is available to start if needed.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/26/01 Walls is day to day with a knee injury. He should be able to play this week.   Muhsin Muhammad  , WR CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/26/01 Muhammad is still battling a turf toe injury. His status for Week 16 is still unclear.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Parker's season is over. He will undergo surgery on his shoulder and the Chiefs are expected to place him on injured reserve.   Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/26/01 Gadsden (hamstring) might miss his second consecutive game this week. Chris Chambers may start in his place again.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 12/26/01 Taylor (groin) has returned to practices and is working with the scout team. He might appear in the team's final game, and is a longshot to play this week. He has missed too much playing time to warrant serious Fantasy consideration at this point of the playoffs.   Rod Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/26/01 Smith (ankles) has returned to practice. He is expected to play this week.   Raghib Ismail , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Ismail is recovering from a mild concussion. He is expected to play this week.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL - Damons Doormats Updated 12/26/01 Galloway is day to day with a hip injury. He is expected to play this week.   Bert Emanuel  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 Emanuel is day to day with an ankle injury. His status for the upcoming week is unclear right now.   James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 12/26/01 McKnight is day to day with an ankle injury. He is expected to play this week.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/26/01 Brunell is day to day with a quadriceps injury. He is expected to play this week.   Mike McMahon , QB DET - Commissioner Updated 12/26/01 McMahon may miss some practice time this week with a foot injury. His status for this week's game is unclear right now, and Ty Detmer will start in his place if he can't play.   Jason Brookins , RB BAL - DeWaynes Demons Updated 12/26/01 Brookins may be able to return for Baltimore's final game. For now, Terry Allen and Moe Williams will continue to split carries.   Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/25/01 Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. However, he may be able to return to the Steelers' starting lineup. Bill Cowher said Bettis is progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy.   James Stewart , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Stewart suffered a sprained ankle early in Sunday's game at Pittsburgh. He was replaced by Lamont Warren in the first quarter, and Stewart did not return.   Cameron Cleeland , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Cleeland injured his Achilles tendon on Sunday. He is not expected to play again this season.   Ahman Green , RB GB - Carsons Wildcats Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn.   Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/23/01 Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee.   Martin Gramatica , K TB - Drunk Monkeys Updated 12/23/01 Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday. The Buccaneers may sign a free agent kicker to replace him in Week 16.  Todd Bouman , QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/23/01 Bouman is now listed as probable for Sunday's game. He should be able to start against the Jaguars, but he may play with some pain in his thumb.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung.   Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 12/23/01 Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.     More Updates   Teams, Player News  [IMAGE]Carsons Wildcats Player News  Mark Brunell , Reserve QB Updated 12/26/01 Brunell is day to day with a quadriceps injury. He is expected to play this week.   Ahman Green , Active RB Updated 12/23/01 Green left Sunday's game in the fourth quarter with labored breathing. He was replaced by Dorsey Levens.   Michael Pittman , Reserve RB Updated 12/21/01 Pittman has been inconsistent as a Fantasy player. Don't rely on him too much during the Fantasy playoffs.  Kurt Warner , Active QB Updated 12/21/01 Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs. Expect fine numbers from him the rest of the way.  David Patten , Active WR Updated 12/21/01 Patten's numbers have dropped off in recent weeks. Don't use him unless your team is very thin at wide receiver.   Rod Gardner , Active WR Updated 12/21/01 Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.   Shannon Sharpe , Reserve TE Updated 12/20/01 Sharpe (leg) practiced on Wednesday. He is expected to play this week.   Bill Gramatica , Reserve K Updated 12/19/01 Gramatica (knee) was placed on injured reserve. Rookie Cedric Oglesby will be Arizona's placekicker for the final three games of the season.   LaDainian Tomlinson , Active RB Updated 12/16/01 Tomlinson had only 69 all-purpose yards on Saturday against Oakland. He seems to be wearing down somewhat, which makes him more and more of a risk for Fantasy owners.   Torry Holt , Active WR Updated 12/14/01 The explosive Holt is a must-start player in Week 14. He will be a regularly featured target for Kurt Warner on Monday Night Football.   Freddie Jones , Reserve TE Updated 12/14/01 Jones has been a Fantasy disappointment again this year. He won't do much during your Fantasy playoffs.  Steve Christie , Active K Updated 12/12/01 Christie will continue to work on field goals. Both he and Wade Richey, who is working on kickoffs, are not reliable Fantasy kickers.  Travis Prentice , Reserve RB Updated 09/03/01 Prentice was traded to the Vikings, where he might see some work as a No. 2 RB, at best. He's not worth a Fantasy draft choice right now.   Rams , Active DT Updated 08/30/01 Head Coach Mike Martz announced that safeties Kim Herring (hamstring) and Adam Archuleta (hamstring), linebackers Mark Fields (thigh) and London Fletcher (hamstring) and CB Aeneas Williams (back) will be held out of the Rams' final preseason game. However, they will all be ready for the season opener against Philadelphia on September 9. The Rams defense is worth a late-round selection on Draft Day.   Steelers , Reserve DT Updated 08/25/01 Defensive back Chad Scott sprained the medial collateral ligament in his right knee on Saturday. He is expected to have an MRI this weekend, and the team is uncertain of just how long he'll be out.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Darnay Scott , WR CIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Scott has been listed as questionable for Sunday's game at Cleveland due to a rib injury. He is expected to miss the game, however, so be sure to put him on reserve this week.   James Allen , RB CHI - Powers Rangers Updated 11/23/01 With Anthony Thomas ailing, Allen will likely start Sunday's game against Minnesota. Considering the Vikings lack of a solid run defense, Allen would be a good Fantasy start in Week 11.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/23/01 According to publised reports, Thomas has been listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Thomas is nursing a hamstring injury, and will likely be replaced in the starting lineup by James Allen.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Chargers Updated 11/23/01 Smith played Thursday but was ineffective. He gained only nine yards on nine carries. Smith remained on the sidelines for most of the second half.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 The Jacksonville Jaguars placed Jones on the waivers-injured reserve list Thursday, effectively ending his five-year career with the team. He caught just eight passes this year before being sidelined with a shoulder injury.    James Stewart , RB DET - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Stewart rushed for 102 yards on 14 carries Thursday, but left the game early with a stinger in his neck. He had missed the previous four games with a sprained right ankle, and is now listed as day to day.   Charlie Batch, QB DET - Damons Doormats Updated 11/23/01 Batch was 8-of-19 for 118 yards with no touchdowns, an interception and a fumble before Mike McMahon, who played one series in the first half, replaced him midway through the fourth quarter. Batch said he couldn't plant and throw effectively because of a groin pull. His status for next week's game is uncertain.    Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/23/01 Banks, who sustained a concussion in last week's game at Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunday's game at Philadelphia.  He sat out Wednesday's practice as a precaution, but all his postgame tests were negative. Kent Graham, who relieved Banks in the 17-10 victory over the Broncos, will start if Banks has a setback.    Rod Smith , WR DEN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/23/01 Smith had seven catches for 81 yards Thursday despite playing on a sprained ankle. He also went over 1,000 yards for the fifth straight season. Smith might be the best receiver in football and is a must start every week.   Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/23/01 Davis could be back next week at Miami. He has missed the last two games because of a torn meniscus.  Olandis Gary , RB DEN - Powers Rangers Updated 11/23/01 Gary broke a bone in his left leg on the second drive of Thursday's game. He is likely out for the rest of the season. Mike Anderson will be the primary back, but Terrell Davis might be able to return next week.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch a TD pass.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis' output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Dans Dawgs Updat! ed! 11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Commissioner Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander, and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.  Tim Brown , WR OAK - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/21/01 Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Damons Doormats Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against t! he! Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/21/01 Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/21/01 Gadsden has been ve! ry! inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.  Tony Gonzalez , TE KC - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/21/01 Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every week.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the end zone ! on! ce again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league.   Larry Parker , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks' secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your lineup.  Priest Holmes , RB KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/21/01 The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday, which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine.  Trent Green , QB KC! -! Kens Killers Updated 11/21/01 Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less mistake-prone quarterback.

  [IMAGE] November 5, 2001 [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] Volume IV, Issue 95 [IMAGE]     Email : info@otcjournal.com   URL : http://www.otcjournal.com    To OTC Journal Members:   Quick Note- Before deciding if you want to participate, please read the OTC Journal's section on Trading Alerts  found on the left hand menu bar of our home page. For a Track Record of former Trading Alerts, Click Here .      [IMAGE] Trading Alert- Cross Media Marketing (AMEX: XMM)   [IMAGE] [IMAGE]  Our last Trading Alert on September 5th was Cross Media Marketing at $1.30. The stock traded up to $1.65 for a 27% return five days after our release, making many of our members very happy with a nice short term gain. In fact, we are convinced the stock would have continued higher had the September 11th disaster not derailed the entire market.   Just like the stray cat you have fed, the OTC Journal is back for more as we had such a great meal the first time around.   Cross Media closed at $6.70 today, but it is really back at the $1.30 level from September 5th. The company completed its merger with Lifeminders on October 25th and did a 1 for 5 reverse stock split. Therefore, split adjusted the stock has returned to the $1.30 level we had so much success with the first time around.   Breaking news on the company just after the market closed today puts Cross Media back on our radar screen. The OTC Journal is bringing this breaking news to you first.   With the Lifeminders merger finally completed, Cross Media is now positioned to enlighten us about future performance. The company revealed today that it anticipates 50% organic growth in 2002, leading to revenues in excess of $150 million, and EBITDA earnings of $23 million. Net earnings are expected to be $15 million, or $1.15 per share post reverse split.   For investors who still believe in looking at PE Ratios, the stock is therefore trading at 5.8 times projected 2002 net earnings with a 50% growth rate. Here is an excerpt from today's news release:     Preliminary projections call for the Company achieving record revenues and earnings for the year ending December 31, 2002.  Revenues are projected to be in excess of $150 million, representing a 50% increase over expected revenues for 2001.  The revenue projection is based on organic growth from all operations and do not give effect to any potential acquisitions.   Net income is expected to grow in excess of 50% resulting in a minimum of $15 million of net earnings and $1.15 earnings per share based on a fully diluted base of approximately 13 million common shares outstanding. EBITDA (defined as earnings before interest, taxes, goodwill, amortization, interest charges and non-cash operating expense) is projected to be in excess of $23 million compared to calendar 2001's projection of $16 million to $18 million.        [IMAGE] Recent Developments [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  We have interviewed management extensively about the state of their business, and have learned the company has benefited dramatically from the Attack on America.   Since the attack, consumers are staying home more. Ratings on TV shows are up, and rental activity at Blockbuster is exploding. People are more prone to consume their entertainment and media at home. This is a mega trend that analysts expect to continue.   The company describes itself as ""a technology- driven cross media marketing company integrating its sophisticated direct marketing skills with cutting-edge technologies, including interactive voice response and web-based systems, resulting in a multi-dimensional marketing platform for the international exploitation of products and services.""   Cross Media had the most successful week in its history just after September 11th. Magazine subscription sales, which represent 75% of the company's revenues, went through the roof. Consumers were demonstrating a desire to stay at home and be informed.   With market conditions improving, investors are seeking undervalued situations with real growth. Cross Media, head quartered just a few miles from the Wall Street Financial district, is bound to end up on the radar screens of institutional investors now that the stock has been recapitalized into the $6.75 range where fund managers will look at it.     [IMAGE] Trading Alert Details [IMAGE]  Here are our thoughts on this Trading Alert on Cross Media Marketing (AMEX: XMM).   The early September move in the stock from the high $6's to nearly $9 came in conjunction with the OTC Journal's last Trading Alert on the stock. According to the company, earnings for 2002 will come in at about $1.22 per share. At $6.75 this makes the stock ridiculously undervalued. The first analyst report on the company was issued August 30th, projecting $27 (split adjusted) in 18 to 24 months. The stock is sitting directly on its support line with volume increasing. Clearly, it is under accumulation and today's news could be the required catalyst to move this stock to the upside.  Buy up to $7.25 which gives you room to make money if the stock trades in our favor. If you can get in under $7 it would be ideal. Very low risk entry level. Set your Stop Loss at $6.00 to give you some room for a short term pullback or what ever your risk tolerance is. If the stock can get through $8.50 in the next few weeks should go higher it could find its way to nearly $10 with a little luck and favorable market conditions. A move to $8.50 would be the same percentage return we provided from our last Trading Alert on this stock. Because of their growth and profitability you can comfortably put this one in your long term speculative portfolio.    The OTC Journal intends to publish follow-up editions on this company. This stock has the potential to be a huge winner.   This newsletter is our opinion only, and not a solicitation to buy this stock. Make up your own mind. If you are looking for a short term trade limit your loss if the stock goes against you. As always, we remind you before making any investment decisions please review the section on our home page on Trading Alerts.  Read our section on Successful Microcap Investing , paying particular attention to the Trading Strategies Section. The track record on our previous alerts can be obtained by clicking here.    In the interest of full disclosure we inform you that one of our editors owns 3000 shares of Cross Media in his own account with an average cost basis of $8.28. Our editor may buy and sell the shares at any time at his own discretion. This should be viewed as a potential conflict of interest.   Here is the complete text of today's news release for your review:     Monday November 5, 4:05 pm Eastern Time  Press Release  SOURCE: Cross Media Marketing Corporation   Cross Media Expects 2002 Revenues and Earnings to Grow by 50+%  Revenues Projected to Surge to $150 Million, Earnings to $15 Million, EPS to $1.15  New York, NY - November 5, 2001 -- Cross Media Marketing Corporation (AMEX: XMM), a leading technology-driven marketing company committed to redefining the art and science of direct marketing, today announced that it expects both revenues and earnings for 2002 to increase in excess of 50%. The announcement was made by Ronald Altbach, Cross Media Marketing's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.   Preliminary projections call for the Company achieving record revenues and earnings for the year ending December 31, 2002.  Revenues are projected to be in excess of $150 million, representing a 50% increase over expected revenues for 2001.  The revenue projection is based on organic growth from all operations and do not give effect to any potential acquisitions.   Net income is expected to grow in excess of 50% resulting in a minimum of $15 million of net earnings and $1.15 earnings per share based on a fully diluted base of approximately 13 million common shares outstanding. EBITDA (defined as earnings before interest, taxes, goodwill, amortization, interest charges and non-cash operating expense) is projected to be in excess of $23 million compared to calendar 2001's projection of $16 million to $18 million.   ""Notwithstanding the serious disruptions in our economy, our growth continues unabated as we continue to demonstrate the inherent strength and stability of this remarkably powerful and responsible multi-channel, multi-product, earnings-generating marketing organization we are building,"" stated Mr. Altbach. ""We continue to be extremely successful in our pursuit of earnings and revenues as the numerous and impressive Cross Media milestones proved with $55 million in revenues for 2000; $100 million expected for 2001; and now revenues in excess of $150 million for 2002 with earnings in excess of $15 million.""   Mr. Altbach continued, ""As a result of our acquisition of LifeMinders last week, we are now well fortified with a solid balance sheet, a significant cash position, a remarkable 25 million consumer database, state-of-the-art technology and a proven management team. Our mantras are growth, earnings and increasing shareholder value.""    ""During 2001, the Company has converted or retired all subordinated debt and redeemed or converted our preferred stock resulting in a highly simplified balance sheet,"" concluded Mr. Altbach.""

"RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel","RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

""Matt has had a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever he has to prove,"" Head Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantasy starter right now, especially against the Dolphins' defense in Week Seven.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Upda! te! d 10/16/01 Dilfer suffered a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he is not expected to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ""There's more to it than just a normal groin pull. We'll just leave it at that,"" Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren said Monday. ""He's injured, and he won't practice this week."" Dilfer is probably the better Fantasy option of the two, but don't expect him to be able to help your team for the next two weeks.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/16/01 Wheatley had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he sustained to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were expected back Tuesday.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/16/01 Smith was in a walking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against the Jets, according to the Miami Herald. He should be fine for Week Seven when the Dolphins return from the bye week.  Brian Griese , QB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/16/01 The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in San Diego, according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the start.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.  Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/16/01 Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. ""He really could possibly play this week,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""We're not going to rule the possibility of him playing completely out."" If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation t! hr! oughout the week.   Justin McCareins , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the ankle Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards.   Eddie Berlin , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Berlin, a rookie receiver used mostly on special teams,  will be sidelined three to four weeks. He suffered a severely separated right shoulder on a kickoff return Sun! da! y.  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Browns' head coach Butch Davis told The Akron Plain-Dealer that Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Ravens. Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout this week.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.  Marco Battaglia  , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Battaglia is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is suffering from a strained left shoulder.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Powers Rangers Updated 10/16/01 Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the most severe concussion he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the game, but threw interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minutes into the fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared himself f! it! enough to play. ""I'm still a little foggy, and my wife was waking me up every few hours to see if I was alive,"" he said, ""but I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready.""      Redskins , DT WAS - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/16/01 Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the injury and is currently listed as day-to-day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as day-to-day.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/16/01 According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/16/01 Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis. The injury is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphia.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we expect him to go.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game.    Reggie Swinton , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Swinton suffered a hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, and is listed as day-to-day.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that attaches his hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday! . ! He is expected to miss six weeks of action due to the procedure.    Raghib Ismail , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact Fantasy-wise.    Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/16/01 Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Carsons Wildcats Updated 10/16/01 Pittman suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was dealing with headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo tests, and is status for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be determined later in the week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would step into the No. 1 RB role once again.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/16/01 Moss is dealing with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from playing at full capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever bench Moss, but considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad idea if your roster allows for a! s! olid replacement.   Doug Chapman , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this weekend against Green Bay due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth picking up for the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put up good numbers against a solid Packers' defense.

Harriet's Holiday Safety Tips:
In all the excitement of the season, it's easy to forget some common
sense safety measures that are especially important to remember with
trees, lights, and decorations. For a safe holiday, please take a
minute to think about some tips I've found come in handy.

Trees:
?     Select only a freshly cut tree. The needles should not be
      falling off from dryness.
?     Keep the tree outside or in a garage until you're ready to
      decorate it.
?     A diagonal cut in the tree trunk will allow the tree to absorb
      water. This will allow the tree to soak up water from the stand.
?     A 6' tree will use 1 gallon of water every two days, so be sure
      to check the water level daily.
?     Trees should be at least three feet away from heat sources such
      as fireplaces, candles, and radiators, also, never block an exit
      with the tree.
?     Artificial trees should bear the UL label. Never use electric
      lights on metal trees like the old silver trees. To avoid
      electric shock on metal trees, use colored spotlights securely
      mounted above or below the tree, never fastened directly on it.
      Plastic trees should be made of fire resistant material.

 Holiday Lights:
?     Use only U.L. approved tree lights. Check for frayed or bare
      wiring, lights with cracked or broken sockets or loose
      connections. If they show signs of wear and tear, throw them away.
?     Use only UL-listed lights, and no more than 3 strands linked together.
?     Decorations can cause overloaded circuits. Watch for signs of
      lights dimming.
?     Turn off all lights on trees and other decorations when you go to
      bed or leave the house.
?     Keep outdoor electrical connectors above ground and out of puddles and snow.

Tree Ornaments and Trimmings:
?     Avoid placing small or breakable ornaments on lower branches
      where children or pets can reach them and knock them off.
?     Also be careful about putting edible decorations low where
      pets and kids can reach them.

All of us at HarrietCarter.com wish you a safe, happy, and festive
Thanksgiving week and want to leave you with one last idea to make
your guests feel warm and welcome.

Harriet's Cozy Cider:

Pour a container of fresh cider into a large saucepan and heat
gently. You can add a little nutmeg or a few cloves, as well an
orange or lemon peel for a real flavor punch. When guests arrive,
ladle them a mug of hot cider with a cinnamon stick for a stirrer.
It's a great way to say ""welcome!""

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    Player Updates NFL Reports  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stret! ch!   Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck f! ro! m a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Commissioner Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will act! iv! ate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yar! ds! on 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Kens Killers Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01  Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie George , RB TEN - Drunk Monkeys Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Feeleys ! Fa! natics Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - Dans Dawgs Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Powers R! an! gers Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I w! as! able to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Chargers Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Damons Doormats Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

      <p>Dear Michael,</p>
<!-- This mail was sent to ""Michael Carson"" <mike.carson@enron.com>, who belongs to list
enl-members-html -->
<!-- CONTENT START -->

<p>The <b>General Accounting Office</b> made it official on Wednesday -
the investigative arm of Congress will <b>sue Vice President Dick
Cheney</b> over his <b>refusal to turn over information</b> related to
the work of his <b>energy task force</b>.  The GAO wants to know with
whom the task force met, especially within the energy industry.  The
<b>White House insists the request is inappropriate</b> and promises to
put up a fight.  On Thursday from the Washington bureau, we'll hear
where this dispute is headed.
<p>The Washington bureau will also have the latest on the Congressional
investigation into Enron.  Several new <b>Enron hearings</b> have been
added to next week's Congressional calendar.  <b>Two big hearings</b>
are scheduled for Monday and former <b>Enron CEO Kenneth Lay is expected
to make an appearance at both</b>.  This will be the <b>first time any
Enron executive has testified before Congress</b>.
<p>West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas will speak one-on-one
with <b>Southern California Edison President Bob Foster</b> Thursday.
He'll discuss <b>SoCal Edison's road to recovery</b> during 1:00 p.m. ET
newscast tomorrow.
<p>On Thursday from Houston, <b>Haynes and Boone LLP Attorney Lenny
Parkins</b> will join us to <b>provide legal analysis on the latest
Enron developments</b>.  Parkins is stopping by the bureau during the
noon ET newscast tomorrow.
<p><b>Energy Intelligence Group Bureau Chief Barbara Shook talks about
LNG projects</b>.  Some of the <b>projects that were scheduled to come
online in the U.S.</b> are now being <b>placed on the back burner due to
low gas prices</b>.  Catch Shook from the Houston bureau on Thursday.
<p>Finally from the NASDAQ in New York, <b>Tyumen Oil Company President
and CEO Simon Kukes</b> will join us.  He'll give us the <b>lowdown on
Russian oil issues</b> at 9:00 a.m. ET on Thursday.

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Standards and Practices Panel


RTO Week

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.  Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/26/01 Culpepper sustained a contusion on his left knee in the second half of Sunday's game against Chicago, but remained in the game. He did not throw a touchdo! wn! pass for the first time this season, however, and has been very inconsistent all year. Don't be surprised if Culpepper continues to struggle if he doesn't get 100 percent healthy from this injury by Week 12.  Charlie Batch , QB DET - Damons Doormats Updated 11/26/01 It is unclear who will start at quarterback for the Lions on Sunday against Chicago, as Batch is still sore from strained groin muscles that limited him on Thursday. Mike McMahon has been getting most of the playing time when Batch can't go, but the Lions' management might start Ty Detmer due to the tough Bears secondary. We don't recommend any of the three for Week 12.  Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 The Cowboys announced Monday that Carter will replace Ryan Leaf as their starting quarterback for next Sunday's game against Washington. Carter started the first game of the season for Dallas, and is 10-for-24 for 38 yards and no touchdowns on the year. We don't recommend him in any league this season.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Feeleys Fanatics Updated 11/26/01 Thomas, who missed Sunday's game against Minnesota with a pulled right hamstring, hopes to return next Sunday against Detroit. Keep an eye on h! is! progress during practice this week before you make a final decision on him.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 Sanders is expected out five-to-seven days due to a nagging hamstring problem that limited him to the first two series of Sunday's game against San Diego. Check back on his status before making a final decision on him for Week 12.  Jeff Graham , WR SD - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/26/01 Graham suffered a bruised thigh in Sunday's loss to Arizona. His current status is day to day.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Commissioner Updated 11/26/01 Brookins may miss the rest of the season with a broken foot. Baltimore will elevate Moe Williams into the starting role and use fullback Obafemi Ayanbadejo as a backup.  Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/26/01 Barlow dislocated his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has not been determined yet.  James Jackson , RB CLE -! D! amons Doormats Updated 11/26/01 Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is day to day.  Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01 Warrick is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinnati's Week 11 loss to the Browns.  Jon Kitna , QB CIN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/26/01 Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game. None of the Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - DeWaynes Demons Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - Chargers Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Commissioner Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Chargers Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Dans Dawgs Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards.! H! e has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Powers Rangers Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Woltys Wonders Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - Powers Rangers Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against Sa! n ! Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Damons Doormats Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Drunk Monkeys Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or Nuts Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Powers Rangers Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Chargers Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Chargers Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six pa! ss! es for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.
