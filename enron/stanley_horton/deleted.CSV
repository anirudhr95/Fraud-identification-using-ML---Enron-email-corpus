Subject:	Azurix

Stan, 
Today is Diane Bazelides' last day of work at Azurix. Over the last month, Diane and I have met several times to transition the Azurix Public Relations function into ETS. Shelley and I also met with John Garrison. As you know, Azurix has a lot of irons in the fire and many of them could turn into public relations challenges. 
Azurix has PR employees in Buenos Aires, Ontario, and California. These employees were notified by Diane that I was taking over the Azurix PR function and to coordinate their activity through me. I've spoken to a few of the PR employees.
To summarize what Azurix might face in the near future, here's what Diane and John provided me and Shelley: 
?	Offers to purchase Azurix North America are due May 24. John anticipates spending one month reveiwing the offers and making management presentations. As a deal is done and made public, information and responses to the media will be coordinated with Mark Hudson in Ontario. 
?	The Madera project in California continues. Cole Frates is on the ground in California and I will coordinate with Cole as issues surface. 
?	Gustavo Pedace is on the ground in Buenos Aires. If I had to guess, this is where Azurix has the most exposure. As July and August approach, we'll know more about the direction of Azurix Buenos Aires. 
?	As things transpire with the other assets, I'll coordinate PR activity with the contacts on the ground. Mark Palmer and his staff know that ETS is involved in Azurix. 
I have a phone call into John Shafer to discuss the use of the crisis center in case of an Azurix emergency. This is a precautionary measure that I hope we don't have to use.
Please let me know if you would like to discuss Azurix and the PR function further. 
Gina

Subject:	NBP Unanimous Consent for Ft. Union



Hardie Davis will be routing a Unanimous Consent for approval by the Partnership Policy Committee on Monday, June 4th, related to the pending financing transaction for the expansion of the Ft. Union system.  The following provides pertinent background information and a summary of the transaction:

Background  
The Ft. Union gathering system was originally project financed (100% debt during construction and 85% debt/15% equity after completion) with Fleet Boston and Credit Lyonnais.  Under this structure, the members executed firm gathering agreements to support the financing.  The sponsors or parents of the members provided pro rata financial guaranties during construction and performance guaranties of the gathering agreements after completion.  Also, the sponsors have provided guaranties to fund a debt service coverage account to the extent that cash flow from operations is not sufficient to meet certain covenant tests.  All project documents such as the gathering agreements and guaranties have been pledged as collateral to the banks.  
  
Currently, Crestone Energy Ventures holds a firm gathering agreement for 100 MMcfd ($5.1 million annually) and NBP/NBILP provides a performance guaranty of this obligation. Please recall that while Crestone holds this firm obligation, the capacity is bundled and resold to producers connected to Ft. Union through Crestone Gathering lines.  Crestone is currently flowing 90 MMcfd through Ft. Union, so they are covering most of their firm obligation.  Also, the firm rate on Ft. Union is $0.14/Mcf but the costs are closer to $0.08/Mcf, so the overage flows back to members through equity distributions.

Transaction  
During the initial construction, the members expected and planned for an expansion of the system within 2-3 years as volumes increased.  Earlier this year, the members approved an expansion of the system from 434 to 635 MMcfd and moved forward with financing the $26.7 million project in the same manner as the original project by amending the existing Credit Agreement.  Given the debt service coverage ratios of the combined project, we negotiated with the banks that the members would be required to only execute firm gathering agreements for 125 MMcfd of the 200 MMcfd expansion.  Therefore, taking into account some other agreements among the members, Crestone will execute a revised firm gathering agreement for an incremental 31.2 MMcfd, bringing their total firm volumes to 131.2 MMcfd and their annual obligation to $6.7 million.  Based upon the volume ramp-up and current acreage dedications, Crestone expects that most, if not all, of this incremental capacity will be resold.

During construction, NBP/NBILP will provide a construction guaranty for its pro rata share of the construction loan, which will be a maximum amount of roughly $9 million.  At completion, the members will contribute an aggregate 15% of the construction costs as equity on a pro rata basis, so NBP's share will be $1.3 million.

In summary, the Unanimous Consent is being routed to provide the Partnership and it subsidiaries with the requisite authority to execute all documents necessary to complete this expansion financing, including the amended firm gathering agreement, the sponsor guaranties, and the consents to assignment.  The transaction is scheduled to close Thursday, June 7th, so the primary task is the completion of the documentation.

"Weekly Report","Stan/Jim,
 
Following is a list of last week's most salient events.
 
Central America/DR:
 
Guatemala:  MARAD will reply this week as to their position vis-a-vis the reduction of Enron's contingent support from $28 to $10 million.  It is possible they will ask for additional information.  
 
Nicaragua:  Current credit ratings required the funding of approximately $6.3 million into a debt service reserve account (project was allowed to sweep the funds against a corporate guarantee by Enron, which was backstopped by the partners pro-rata to their ownership in the project).  Partners to reimburse Enron their pro-rata share, such that Enron's ultimate outflow will be approximately $2.2 million.  Team tried to get MARAD to agree to alternative solutions but MARAD simply refused citing bad past experience and political implications.
 
Panama:  Team in Houston last week to review the upcoming PPA bids by Elektra (one of the two distribution companies in Panama).  Three issues are worth noting: (i) requirement to post bid bonds (approximately $10 million) will likely need some sort of Enron support (BLM can't get bid bonds on its own although local management continues attempting to do so); (ii) BLM's marginal costs are among highest in Panama.  A preliminary strategy has been mapped out; and (iii) PPA terms are a bit ""one-sided"" in favor of the distributor.  BLM and other market participants have tried repeatedly to get the distco to change terms without success.  
 
Dominican Republic:  El Paso confirmed it can't work with us.  Operationally, the plant is working well.  As noted on an earlier e-mail, EFI's fuel supplier for SECLP, Vitol, asked for a letter of credit or pre-payment terms.  Enron rejected the request.  SECLP bought cargo directly from Vitol.  We are working closely with Tom Moran of ENE credit on these issues.
 
Ecoelectrica:
This week was a very productive week.  Update as follows:  Lender Process:  Based on several conversations this week, lenders have stated they understand that Mirant's insurance package is the result of market conditions.  Lenders are prepared to pursue credit committee approval with the $300 million coverage.  Mirant offered a 6-month only waiver on the deductibles.  Lenders appear content with that option.  ENE insurance has approximately 75% of the underwriters on board with our back-up plan to provide the additional $200 million tranche.  Backup will be used only if credit committee(s) kick back existing coverage.  Mirant to issue a certification of compliance with QF (by Eco) and a legal opinion asap.  Based on the progress this week and the remaining commitment on deliverables, it is expected that the lender's agent can put together the entire lender package and submit it to the lender group by Tuesday of next week.  Finally, Mirant also committed to providing comments (if any) to the Lender Consent Agreement.  ENE and EME have reviewed and provided comments already.  GE Consent:  Mirant committed to sending their ""versions"" of the key documents on the GE buy-out on Friday nite (late).  I have not seen the document but they have repeatedly stated that the documents are ""conforming"".  Union Carbide Guarantee:  Plan to finalize language early next week.  Schedule:  Mirant has committed to fulfilling CP's as early as possible (and is acting on that statement) as long as we can allow them to fund on 12/19.  They state they are confident they can close CP's by earlier than 12/14 and can fund on 12/19.  CSFB has not shed light on the apparent funding (timing) limitation but has offered to investigate further.  
 
APACHI  
 
Philippines: The team did an excellent job of advancing discussions and negotiations with NPC but was unable to move the slow government machinery fast enough to make it to a signing by last Thursday's New York event.  Nevertheless, momentum is high and team continues to work toward a 12/15 agreement date; funding wouldn't occur until early next year. 
 
Guam:  Continue discussions with Mirant and AES with a focus on getting them over the hump on the issue of Enron's contingent obligation to cover the potential shortfall under a GPA buy-out event.  Work continues.  Meetings have been set with Dr. Boyce to discuss his interest in the Guam project.  
 
China:  Unit 2 still scheduled to come back on line on 11/23.  Two likely causes still under investigation (poor vaccum or material design flaw).  Work on capital reduction for Chengdu on hold until discussions are held with Houston to ensure consensus.  In the mean time, several parties have approached us with interest in Chengdu.  On Hainan, team is paying several visits to the new SAFE representatives, first to work on the mid November repayment ($10 million).   Next step would be liquidation.  
 
Europe  
 
Gaza:  Waiting to hear from CCC (partner) on conceptual proposal: ENE to provide limited technical support and financial services support to help put in place cost over-run facility and to help with remaining construction activities and CCC to take our equity (at no cost) and any remaining obligations.  Aim is to eliminate the potential exposure on ENE's $9 million of guarantees.  
 
Trakya:  During meetings in London, OPIC informed us that they had had good meetings with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy.  Government stated they would ""clean up"" arrears but could not do so before January 2002 (presumably there are no budget funds left).  Government committed to work with OPIC on resolving the forex dispute issue but acknowledged that the legal opinion they had sought and received didn't address the issue properly and thus needed additional work to provide the Government with the backing it needed to give the issue resolution.  OPIC agreed to send the Government ""terms of reference"" on their conceptual agreements.  On our question of change in frequency in the distribution of dividends OPIC stated they would expeditiously move to review our proposal, indicating no pre-disposed position against it.  
 
Sarlux:  team continues to prepare to submit response to EPC contractor's claim, as well as our own counter-claim, all scheduled to be submitted on November 30th.   Team continues to work on sorting out technical issues at the plant, including meetings with senior Texaco officials.  
 
ENS:  local team and Adam Overfield worked to resolve remaining issue over final completion certificate.  Issue was related to CO2 emmissions on GT12 vs the EPC contract parameters.  Team has convinced the lender's engineer that issue is of no relevance.  Team is now moving to secure lender approval.  This releases $1.95 million of contingent support by ENE.  
 
Europe Sales Prospects:  IPower submitted preliminary proposals for ENS and Trakya, both well below expectations.
 
Other:  Team is working closely with RAC to come up with updated fair market valuations, cashflow projections by month for the quarter ended Dec. 31, and revised/updated transfer restriction information.
 
Thanks, Mariella
 
Isabel: please distribute to team as customary.

"Potential Deal","Stan/Jeff:

I have been contacted by a number of close friends/business contacts that want to put together a deal to buy a number of our smaller assets, primarily the power assets.  The strategy they have in mind is simple.  They want to offer us a lightning quick sale of a package of small non-core assets that together would be a material deal that could be announced and help stabilise our situation.  They would then be able to manage in a more orderly manner either the sale or continued operation of the assets and hopefully realise a premium over what they pay us.  They have power and energy industry experience.  In the interest of full disclosure, they asked me to participate in the deal, but I have said that probably makes a negotiated deal unlikely given the related party concerns.  I indicated if they want to do a deal, they will have to leave me out of it. They have indicated a willingness to conduct due diligence over ten days, sign an agreement and announce the deal and then close by end of the year, but only if we can begin immediately.  They are assuming we would put a priority on both announcing and funding a deal quickly.  They are willing to structure around issues to meet this objective.

I intend to meet with these guys and make my own judgement as to the legitimacy of the proposal.  I think they are considering a transaction of between 100 - 200 million.  It would probably involve a half dozen or so assets.  Not a huge deal, but it would efficiently get rid of some cats and dogs.  It probably qualifies as a ""fire sale"", but might make sense anyway.

Your thoughts?

Subject:	Proposal to Change ""Commercial Support"" peer group label to ""Professional Services""

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small circle of people.

"HEALTH & WELFARE BENEFITS","Peggy:

Considering where we are in the divestiture process, I don't think it is the right time to have PGE contract for and administer the Health and Welfare Benefits noted in your memo dated 04/20/01.  In addition, it is likely that a potential buyer would want PGE to come under its own Health and Welfare Benefits.  Switching now could entail having PGE employees being under three Plans in a relatively short period of time.

"Enron Kids Adopt A Child Program","


 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to ""sponsor"" every child in that school.  What we mean by ""sponsor"" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to ""sponsor"" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!
Kevin Hyatt x35559 & The Enron Kids Committee

Subject: UE 115 reconsideration denied - rate mitigation proposalpending


Two pieces of info here.
 
1.  The Commission denied the request of CUB, ICNU, and AOI to reconsider the UE 115 rates and reduce them to avoid rate shock.  I have just read the Order and probably could not have written it better.  The Commission left us in a better place as far as a possible appeal, if that was possible.  
 
2.  OPUC Staff has requested, however, that we file a rate mitigation proposal outside of the UE 115 docket.  We explored several alternatives with parties in early November.  We would like to be responsive, if for no other reason than to build some goodwill back with these groups as we head in to the transaction process.  Here is what we would like to propose:
 
a.  For all customers 30 kW and above, we would spread our 2002 short-term purchases over two years, delivering a credit in 2002 and switching to a collection in 2003.  This would result in a balance to collect as of 12/02 of about $70 million.  This would be collected on a dollar-for-dollar basis in 2003, with no risk to us for load variations.
 
b.  For all customers, we would manage 2002 rate changes to maintain current levels except for
 
    -  the 3% public purpose charge, which would occur 3/1 as scheduled
    -  a possible increase for the 2002 PCA if extreme adverse conditions (hydro primarily) indicate that we will otherwise end the year with a very large balance.
 
We can accomplish this through some creative use of $$ we are holding to return to customers and temporary delays in some minor rate changes scheduled for the fall of 2002.
 
While we will file this, I do not know if the Commission will accept it or whether various interests will intervene in opposition.  Any changes to this would probably only decrease the amount we are financing, not increase it.  The plan would have an effective date of 1/1/02 if accepted.  
 
Jim Piro is reviewing this and we would need some action by either the Commission or NNG to be able to do it, because of our current cash and short-term debt situation.  Solutions exist.  Please let me know if we can proceed.  I do think this is important for the success of our transaction filing, even if it ultimately does not occur.  That we made an effort will be remembered.

"Employee issues","Corporate comp is relooking at your contract based on our converstion..ieyou would be entitled to severance payment eqyual to 2 year salary and bonus should you decide to leave the company provided that all or substantially all of the Azurix assts other than ?Wessex and Azurix Bu7enos Aires are sold.

I will meet with Jim Derrick today to discuss John Ale.

With regard to Beckett and Glasford; their agreements provide for retention bonuses provided they stay until September 16th.  If they voluntarily leave before that they get nothing.  There is no employment agreements in place that link anything to comparable positions titles or anything else.  Should we move them over to Enron in Director positions and they are subsequently offerred positions elsewhere in Enron ( once we dispose of non-Wessex and ABA assets) at Director positions, then they have a choice of  accepting those positions or voluntarily terminating.  Since there is no contractual agreements with these two I do not want to offer any kind of enhanced severance payments to them.  I have contacted Ben Glisan regarding Glasford and he is polling his people about their view on an appropiate placement for him.

I will talk with you when you return.

Thanks.

"Audit Committee Meeting/Engagement Letters","Because all of the members of the Audit Committee will not be available for a telephonic meeting until Wednesday morning,  the Audit Committee meeting to approve the various engagement letters has been scheduled for 10:00 AM on Wednesday morning.  Work by the Audit Committee's advisors will commence in advance of that meeting.

I have provided Pace Consultants with my suggested changes to its engagement letter, and those changes have been made by Pace Consultants.  The revised engagement letter is being reviewed by Audit Committee counsel.
As soon as it is approved by Audit Committee counsel, Stan Horton or Dana Gibbs can sign it on behalf of EOTT, and Pace will immediately commence its work (if it has not already done so).

"Q2 forecast","Attached is a spreadsheet that compares our original plan (budget plus
overview) to our forecast for the 2nd quarter with actuals for April and May
and last months forecast for June.  We are in the process of completing our
May closing but the IBIT number for May is 99% complete.  The June forecast
was prepared last month and we are now in the process of updating our forecast
of power cost and IBIT for June.  We should complete that next week.   Curves
in the west continue to come down which will potentially reduce our IBIT for
June, but I will know more next week.  

The spreadsheet shows 70.1 million IBIT compared to what I provided you early
this week of 65 million.  The primary difference is power cost and our view
that given the current movement in wholesale prices from May 8 that power cost
could rise by an additional 5 million from that level.  We are currently in
the dead band zone for the PCA so any change in power cost go right to IBIT.  
There is one other issue related to power cost concerning our need to
potentially increase our reserves for the California receivables.  AA
continues to push us on this issue to increase the amount of reserves.  If we
have a good June we might want to increase our reserves, however this is
something we will talk with Bob Butz about early next month when June results
are available.

Please call if you would like to discuss this further.  We will have a better
look at June next week once the updated forecast is completed.

This is nothing short of outrageous!  You need to get control of your PR/communciations team.  Once again, so there is absolutely no misunderstanding, no press releases or advertising goes out without coordination/review by me (through Mary)!!  If it happens again, it will be grounds for dismissal!  This is especially the case for a release concerning Enron Corp.  We can not make (and never could make in all the year's Enron has owned us) any type of press release concerning ENE without Houston's review (we will now be receiving vocal complaints from Houston).  I can not understand how this occurs, and frankly, as of today, I am going to start holding you responsible.  Get control over your team!!  Adam

PS As you obviously know, with everything going on, I have not given Andrea the notice we discussed.  Clearly, I must do it now.

"RE: ETS IT November Newsletter Now Available","We created the framework for the newsletter within ETS.  Now it only takes limited time from a staff level individual to put it together. There were, and are, no corporate resources used in its creation or publication.

We were looking to keep business as usual, especially as relating to communication, but given our extraordinary circumstances will stop publication if you think it more appropriate.

Please advise.

Thank you.

*The decrease in active deals is from the early termination of both the NNG & TW ISDA agreements with RMTC effective 12/14/2001.  The increase in VaR is because the TW terminated contracts with RMTC have not yet been replaced.  The VaR is currently over the ETS VaR limit of $1,000,000.

** All of our El Paso positions are closed as of December 18, 2001 and we have a net liability with a fair value of $2.3mm.

The terminated contracts with RMTC are now fixed receivables as of the early termination date of December 14, 2001 except for interest. NNG is owed $4.8mm and TW is owed $33.9mm.  Amounts are past due.


Definitions:
Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport and storage agreements or unhedged natural positions.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.

Active Physical Positions	38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	345.0 	
VaR ($thousands)	159.4 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	0	
		



Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Hi Cindy, how are you? I'm not surprised that you didn't receive my email
to
Stan. After returning to the states recently from a three week trip, I've
had
nothing but problems with my email as I've switched several times. Anyway,
my
last note to Stan was to inform him that I'm back in the states and would
like
to take him up on his previous offer, from our last meeting, to introduce
me
to the key leaders in EES. Currently, I'm engaged in a consulting
assignment
which may take me back to Asia but I know that I will be in town June 8 and

11. I will be traveling to the west coast next week but you can always
reach
me on my mobile or email. Thanks for calling me back. See ya soon!

As you probably know, I have accepted a position as Regulatory Analyst reporting to Joe Hartsoe.  My last day in Houston is June 29 and I will start my new responsibilities on July 16.

By means of this message I want to thank you for making this possible.  This is a big challenge for me and opens a new spectrum of possibilities in a completely different arena.

I am looking forward to being a part of the ETS team.

Thanks again,

Subject:	Proposal to Change ""Commercial Support"" peer group label to ""Professional Services""

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small circle of people.

David

In advance of the May meeting of EOTT's Board of Directors, EOTT's sole shareholder signs a written consent providing for the annual election of EOTT's directors.  At the May meeting, the Board of Directors elects committee members and chairs for the next 12 months.  Are either of you aware of any upcoming changes in the composition of EOTT's Board of Directors?  In the past, we have had directors who have stepped down immediately prior to the ""annual meeting.""    Please advise me early next week as to whether there will be any changes to EOTT's Board of Directors in order that I may have the appropriate consent of sole shareholder signed.

Dan Whitty (Chairman), Ted Gaylord, and Dee Osborne are the current members of the Audit Committee.  John Duncan (Chairman), Dee Osborne, and Dan Whitty are the current members of the Compensation Committee.  Will there be any changes to these committees?

Thank you for your help.

"GISB Editorial Review Board","Stan,

If you're still on GISB's Editorial Review Board, you should receive a communication from GISB this week or early next week.

The pipeline segment has discovered numerous substantive errors in version 1.5 of the GISB standards, which were published last August.  We have requested that GISB correct the books and send the corrected publication to the FERC.  The Editorial Review Board will probably be asked to review the correspondence that will be sent to the FERC.

I was involved in the pipeline segment effort.  Please let me know if you need further information or would like me to review the FERC correspondence when you receive it.  GISB has agreed to take specific actions that were requested by the pipeline segment.

Thanks,

"GISB Board of Directors Officers for 2002","Dear GISB Board Members,

Bill  Boswell,  Hugh  Roberts  and  Julie Gomez, GISB's chairman, first and
second vice chairs, respectively, assumed office at the March 2001 meeting.
Under  established  guidelines Hugh would have become the 2002 chairman and
Julie  the  first vice chair; however, due to a reassignment, Hugh resigned
from the board and GISB was left without a first vice chairman.

The  Producer Segment directors have informed the GISB Office they have not
yet decided on a replacement for Hugh as first vice chairman, but in any
event none of them desire to  assume  the Chairmanship in March 2002.
Likewise, Julie Gomez has also declined  to  assume the Chairmanship,
although she is willing to remain as
vice  chairman  for  the  coming  year.   Therefore,  the  Producer Segment
directors and Julie Gomez of the Services Segment, are requesting Bill
Boswell to
continue  as  chairman throughout 2002, and these segments will then resume
their  rotation at the end of Bill's extended term.  This is similar to the
situation  which  occurred  when Steve Chesebro' continued as chairman from
June  1994  to  March 1996, after which, Mary Jane McCartney rotated to the
chairmanship.

Bill  Boswell  was  asked  and has agreed to do so long as it was clear the
request  was  from  the Producer Segment as next in line for the chair, and
provided Julie Gomez as second in line also requested this to be handled in
that manner.  This has been done with both the producer directors and Julie
also requesting this issue be clarified now so as to provide GISB and NAESB
with clear continuity into next year.

Pursuant  to  the bylaws, the existing officers will continue through 2002;
therefore,   Bill   Boswell   will  continue  as  chairman,  the  producers
subsequently  will  name  a  first vice chair in place of Hugh Roberts, and
Julie Gomez will remain as second vice chair.

I look forward to seeing you in Houston or hearing from you over the phone on
December 5 -- Best Regards, Rae

Mr. Horton:

I understand that we recently rejected a cash offer for the wind company from a J.P.Morgan-backed group for approximately $400m. My understanding is that we have been trying to sell this company almost since we bought it, that the price is much higher than our cost basis, and that we definitely need the liquidity for our core businesses.  Are we reconsidering ?

"Wind Co - PTC Update","As you may know by now, Congress has adjourned without extending the PTC (see attached).  The Democrats would not support any extenders bill as leverage to get a Stimulus Package passed and everything died.  The Speaker has asked the President to call Congress back on Jan 2 to debate the Stimulus Package, but that seems unlikely. The best we can now hope for is that Congress takes up PTC either as part of the Stimulus Package or an Energy Bill in Feb/March '02.  

For the wind co, this is good and bad.  The good is that while the Enron BK has kept customers away, at least now none of our competitors can book orders either.  My hope is that PTC extension and the announcement of a new owner for EW will happen about the same time.  The bad news is that it means our US business will be further hurt - a 200 unit '02 is now out of reach and a 100-125 unit year may be the best we can hope for (assuming the PTC is extended in Q1).  (Maybe the Candover folks knew something we didn't, although I doubt it).  For sale purposes, we will run our '02 numbers at 150 units and put as positive a spin on it for bidders as we can.  Bottom line is that '02 will be a break-even to small profit year for us in the US.

Stan - we are in the process of revising our financial projections for a teaser to be sent out to bidders next week and this news will be reflected in those projections (meaning that the sale projections will now differ slightly from what we submitted to Enron earlier this week).  Also, we have launched reductions in force in the US.  I will reduce our MFG workforce by around 85 right after the first of the year and expect to have to let another 100-150 go early in Q1.  I will keep you posted.

Subject:	PTC UPDATE

The House members have left without passing an extenders bill. House Majority Leader Dick Armey refused to let the Extenders Package come to the House floor because he felt it wouls demonstrate to the Senate Democrats that the House Republicans were not serious about the Stimulus Package. Armey and Bill Thomas got into a shouting match on the floor as Thomas tried to get Armey to move the bill. Thomas and Rangel (the ranking Democrat on Ways and Means) had agreed on a one year extension which is also what the Senate Republicans would agree to.
This is partisan politics at its worst. There were no valid public policy reasons to not pass an extenders package 
Our only option at this point is to go back in January and try to get the extenders passed. They will be looking at an Economic Stimulus Package again if the economic conditions don't improve. There are 15 expiring provisions in the current bill so we will have alot of other groups fighting for extenders.
My apologies to all of you. I am devasted by this turn of events.
Hap

Association of Oil Pipe Lines

The opinions if any expressed in these notes are the author's only and do
not represent the views of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines (but they
should).


1.	Joint Pipeline Associations Meet with Secretary Mineta


On Monday, December 17, along with the natural gas transmission and
distribution trade associations, we met with Secretary of Transportation
Norman Mineta to pledge the full support of the joint pipeline associations
for enactment of pipeline safety reauthorization legislation in the 107th
Congress.  Joe Monroe of Unocal and Tom Miesner of Conoco represented the
liquid pipeline associations.  The Secretary was very pleased and, we think,
relieved to see the pipeline industry united behind a common set of
proposals.  He committed to working with us to facilitate passage of an
acceptable bill in the House, which is the next step.  The proactive stance
of the combined industry associations on reauthorization legislation is
essentially CEO driven, and organizing it has been largely the work of Joe
Monroe, Captain for Gas-Liquid Relations Team of the AOPL/API Joint
Environmental and Safety Initiative.

We also urged the Secretary to expedite issuance of the four liquid rules
that AOPL and API wrote to him about on December 4. (See the letter on the
AOPL website at
http://www.aopl.org/news/2001/Mineta.4.rules.letter.12.3.012.pdf -- repair
criteria for integrity management; the Integrity rule of small lines; the
corrosion rule update; and the revised incident reporting rule).  These four
complete an impressive series of new rules for liquid pipelines begun after
the Bellingham accident in June 1999.  DOT hopes to have all four out by
yearend.  This series of provides powerful evidence that OPS regulation of
pipeline safety is neither lax nor inadequate.

2.	Pipeline Safety Legislation Introduced in the House

On Thursday, December 20, shortly before Congress recessed for the
Christmas-New Years break, key House members introduced H.R. 3609, the
""Pipeline Infrastructure Protection To Enhance Security and Safety Act"".
The bill was introduced by Rep. Don Young (R-AK), Chairman of the House
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and cosponsored by Rep. Billy
Tauzin (R-LA), Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Thomas
Petri (R-WI), Joe Barton (R-TX), Gene Green (D-TX), Brad Carson (D-OK), Max
Sandlin (D-TX) and Ralph Hall (D-TX).  Rep. Petri and Rep. Barton chair
subcommittees that will hold the hearings on the bill in these two
committees.  It is highly significant that the sponsorship of this bill
includes both of the House committees that claim jurisdiction over pipeline
safety.  It will be very helpful to have these committees cooperating rather
than fighting with each other.  The bipartisan co-sponsorship of the bill is
also significant.  Passage of a reasonable bill depends on cooperation
across party lines, and this is an excellent start.

If the House is to pass a pipeline safety bill in this Congress, H.R. 3609
will be the vehicle.  The bill is a serious effort with new provisions not
seen before.  The text of the bill will be posted on the Library of Congress
website: http://thomas.loc.gov.  If you need a copy sooner, let us know and
we'll send one to you.  This bill is the starting point for the pipeline
safety debate in the House.  It is significantly different from the
bipartisan Senate- passed pipeline safety bill, S.235, authored by Sen. John
McCain (R-AZ) and others.  H.R. 3609 incorporates post 9/11 security
considerations and doesn't attempt to write into law desired actions on
pipeline integrity management that have already taken or are in process by
the Office of Pipeline Safety.  The task for the House, the Administration
and the industry now will be to review the provisions of the introduced
bill, improve on them where needed, build a consensus in support of the
basic bill and, if necessary to achieve a critical mass of support for
passage, add additional provisions.   Look for hearings to begin in
February, probably leading off with a general oversight hearing on the
issues, followed by hearings on the bill itself.  The Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee's press release on introduction is at
http://www.house.gov/transportation/

3.	Department of Energy Conference on Security of Energy Facilities

On December 11-12, the Department of Energy hosted a conference with
representatives of state governments, and the energy industry associations
to discuss energy security, assurance, reliability and energy emergency
preparedness. This conference sets the stage for future cooperative efforts
between the states, the industry and the DOE.  Check out the presentations
on the website of the National Association of State Energy Officials:

4.	Energy Information Administration Releases Annual Energy Outlook 2002

This is the official federal government view on what is likely to happen in
energy markets in the near term.  The report is interesting browsing even
for those who aren't energy nerds.  Go to
ttp://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/  -- Annual Energy Outlook 2002 with
Projections to 2020 (DOE/EIA-0383 (2002), December 21, 2001).

5.	FERC Issues Proposed Rule on Accounting for Derivatives

	The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission this week issued a Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking entitled ""Accounting and Reporting of Financial
Instruments, Comprehensive Income, Derivatives and Hedging Activities.""
This rule proposes to revise FERC regulations to update the accounting and
reporting requirements under its Uniform Systems of Accounts for oil
pipelines, among others to establish uniform accounting requirements and
related accounts for the recognition of changes in the fair value of certain
security investments, items of other comprehensive income, derivative
instruments, and hedging activities.   In particular, the Commission
proposes to add new balance sheet accounts to the Uniform Systems of
Accounts to record items of other comprehensive income and derivative
instruments.  The Commission also intends to revise the Form 6 to include
this reporting.
	Comments on the proposed rule will be due within 60 days of publication in
the Federal Register.  We will let you know when that occurs.  In the
interim, you can take a look at this proposed rule by going to
http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\CIPS\RULES\RM\RM02-3.000.TXT.
We also need to understand how much our member companies will be impacted by
this rulemaking.  Please give us your thoughts.

6.	Red Butte Depreciation Order Issued

	The Commission approved a depreciation rate of 12.50% for Red Butte.  Red
Butte had requested the change due to a crude oil reserve report indicating
exhaustion in eight years of the remaining reserves of Oregon Basin field,
which produces the majority of Red Butte's crude oil and more than fifty
percent of its revenues.  The Commission's order may be found at
http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\CIPS\OIL\O_MS\DO02-1.000.TXT.

7.	FERC Rejects of SFPP Compliance Filing

	SFPP filed new tariffs in response to the Commission's Opinion No. 435-B
proposing a rate decrease for movements on its East Line (Texas to Arizona)
effective December 1, 2001 and December 20, 2001, depending upon the tariff.
The Commission rejected the tariffs, stating that revised tariffs must be
effective August 1, 2000.  The orders may be found at
http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\CIPS\OIL\IS\IS02-46.000.TXT and
http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\CIPS\OIL\IS\IS02-82.000.TXT.

8.	Exxon Mobil Files HOOPS Settlement

	Exxon Mobil this week filed a settlement this week with the FERC reached on
the HOOPS offshore facility.  A copy may be obtained at
http://rimsweb1.ferc.gov/rims.q?rp2~rimsdocinfo~2230884.

9.	Commission Moves to Internal Paragraph Numbering

	The FERC will be moving to a more uniform citation methodology for its
orders and opinions.  Given the number of different forms in which these
orders and opinions are published, both electronically and in paper,
accurate citation to the body of Commission orders is difficult.  To resolve
the issue, the Commission has decided to adopt internal paragraph numbering,
with the goal of creating uniform citation that will reference these
paragraphs.  To learn more about this initiative, go to
http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\CIPS\MISC\CA\CA121901.00A.TXT.

10.	Commission Revises Gas Pipeline Outreach Requirements

	The FERC has been struggling with how to improve communications with
landowners about prospective gas pipeline projects.  It has been come up
with a number of proposals including significant pre-filing communications
requirements.  Now, the Commission staff has developed a report entitled:
Ideas For Better Stakeholder Involvement In The Interstate Natural Gas
Pipeline Planning Pre-Filing Process.  The report can be downloaded from the
FERC web-site at www.ferc.gov or requested by e-mail at: gas
outreach-feedback@ferc.fed.us.
	This FERC initiative does not apply to oil pipelines but does indicate what
the FERC expects of gas pipeline sponsors.  The Staff is also planning a
series of workshops in the new year to bring interstate natural gas
companies and Federal, state and local agency representatives, and
landowners together to discuss implementation of stakeholder involvement
programs.  For more on this initiative, go to
http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\CIPS\MISC\M_MS\MS121801.000.TXT.

11.	Platte Filing Makes Shippers Unhappy

	Platte made a cost-of-service filing several months ago, seeking to raise
the ceiling level on its tariffs.  That filing was not protested.  Platte
then filed to increase its rates to a level under the ceiling level
established.  That filing has been protested by Big West, Chevron Products,
Frontier Oil and Refining, Tesoro West Coast, Phillips 66, and Conoco Inc.
The docket number IS02-65.  Copies of the filings may be found under
http://rimsweb1.ferc.gov/rims.

12.	Express Filing Protested

	Express too made a tariff filing that was not acceptable to all.  It was
protested by Big West, Chevron Products, Sinclair, and Tesoro West Coast.
Express then withdrew the tariff.  To take a look at the pleadings, go to
http://rimsweb1.ferc.gov/rims, look under the docket number IS02-81.

13.	OPS Forms Available on Line

	The new Evaluation Report of a Liquid Pipeline Carrier is available on the
OPS website at
http://ops.dot.gov/forms/Eval_Liquid_Transmission07_13_2001.pdf. Also
available is the Operator Qualification review form for liquid pipelines at
http://ops.dot.gov/forms/OQl040401.pdf. OPS also warns that it will soon
begin electronic incident reporting for gas transmission lines.  Liquid line
reporting will no doubt follow thereafter.  See
http://ops.dot.gov/electronic_reporting.htm.

14.	Northwestern U. Offers Course in Houston

	The Northwestern University Transportation Center is taking the mountain to

Operational Excellence in the Pipeline Industry"" at the main campus outside
Chicago, it will present the program in the Houston area.  The course will
be offered March 12-14, 2002.  For more program information, go to the

"RAC Website & Portfolio Tracking System","
During the month of June, RAC will begin the rollout of our new website and linked portfolio tracking system called PortRAC.  The website will provide the user with instantly available transaction policies, procedures, DASH's and other valuable reports and links.  The PortRAC system is an extensive database of merchant and strategic investment information combined with a powerful search engine and report writer.  PortRAC will enable the analysis of our investment portfolio in any fashion that the user specifies such as the calculation of returns for a particular industry or region.

I believe that the new RAC website and PortRAC system will be valuable tools to help manage our business and I would like to provide you a personal ""demo"" before we introduce these applications to a broader population.

In the next two weeks, Rick Carson will be contacting you to arrange a convenient time for the demo, which should take about 30 minutes.  I hope that you will be able to make time in your schedule.

Please call me with any questions.

Subject:	MTBE legislation

Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental ""anti-backsliding"" provision focused only on air-toxics and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer ""transition assistance""

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the ""transition assistance"" piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are pleased with the inclusion of a ""placeholder"" while the Senate decides on the best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives (which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a ""date certain"" gives producers more flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE -- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

Debbie is meeting with her attorney on Friday regarding the post marital
agreement modification.  I do not think it is much of an issue so we
should get revision executed very soon.

I have gone through the Agreement again and they look fine.  My notes
indicate only the following changes need to be made:

1.  Caron's portion of the inheritance if I die first should be the
lesser of 5% or $3million and she pays the tax due;

2.  The house I own at 9302 Cypresswood Drive together with all
furnishings etc would be left to Debbie instead of the marital trust;
and,

3. J> P> Morgan/Chase Bank would be an alternate to MSDW as trustee.

What is the next step?

"GTB Payment status","We met with GTB representatives yesterday and today, and worked out an agreement in principle for an assignment of our contract to a replacement contractor.  The commercial terms have been tentatively agreed to, pending GTB management approval.  The other terms and conditions are generally agreed to, and the actual wording is in draft form; the expectation is to execute the letter agreement by 31 December 2001.  Also, GTB expects to execute their agreement with the replacement contractor by 11 January 2002, with the assignment from EPCSC to be effective then.

GTB agreed to pay their past due invoices by 26 December 2001.  A payment schedule, with conditions and target dates, was agreed to for the balance of payments.  All are targeted to be paid during January 2002.

Enron Pipeline Construction Services Company (EPCSC) received no payments since last week's report.  The total paid to date is $4,058K (EPCSC's portion remains at $3,476K).    

Nine EPCSC invoices remain past due, and the following is a summary of the GTB payments ""in process"" (either debit noticed or invoiced), along with their forecasted due dates:

"Thanksgiving Message to EGS US Employees","Stan,

Below is a Thanksgiving note from you to all EGS US employees.  Please let me know what feedback you have.  John Ambler reviewed and approved this message.  I'd like to get this out to employees on Tuesday, Nov. 20.

Also, I'm on tap with Lou to get an ETS Salutes memo out early next week acknowledging the employees/departments who worked this week on the financing.

Look forward to hearing from you....Gina



With the Thanksgiving Holiday upon us, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.  
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives and who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. 
I know here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and everyone in the organization is working hard.  Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends.   
Happy Thanksgiving.

"Weelky Update","-Thanksgiving day storm, never fails, that wind and weather arrive for holiday. Crews worked good part of day, but were able to get customers restored for turkey dinners.
-OPUC denied customer advocacy groups request for reconsideration of rate increase. Staff did request that we consider smoothing the rate increase, by financing over longer period of time and keeping rates higher, rather than decreasing as prices come down. Working to analyze options and determine if Enron and NW Natural would allow, given increased debt that would be required in short-term. Would like to at least give some customers option of having this choice, if financials look neutral and approvals can be obtained.
-Enron uncertainty is creating problems with our issuing of debt. Have call scheduled with corporate to discuss this week.
-Allegheny Energy Supply Co, temporarily limited trading to prompt month because PGE is an affliate of Enron. After discussion of OPUC ring-fence, trading was reinstated.
-The market is experiencing increased trading outside of Enron-On-Line.
-PGE is no longer allowed to transact with Dynegy.

Today, the FBI issued an alert to all its offices that Osami Ben Laden has directed his cohorts to attack the U.S. natural gas supplies in the event of his death or capture or that of his general Mullah Omar. There is no corroboration of this information but thought you might be asked about the likelihood. The article appears in Natural Gas Intelligence this afternoon.

"EOTT","Stan - 

Phil forwarded (to me) your response (see below) to the e mail he had sent regarding the Robin Border memo. I concur with your thoughts on trust and will continue my efforts in that regard. 

'Thanks for the update.  Doesn't appear as Robin is helping out any.  I am not sure why Dana values his opinions so much on this topic.  Keep working the progress.  The key people you need to make happy are Robert and Dan.  I trust that Mike is developing a effective relationship with them and Dana.  Trust is essential in making this partnership work.'  

I've been meeting with a nunber of the ETS folks that have been working on EOTT issues and assignments, and although we have been working hard, we simply have some additional work to do in the areas of communication, which I will address and facilitate. We meet with the commercial folks on Tuesday after the normal EOTT Staff Meeting regarding the Enhanced Integrity Plan, where we can hopefully move forward. In addition, I will put together a presentation outlining the 2002 EOTT Integrity Plan for presentation the next time the commercial folks meet. It will also include facts of our on-going remediation plan and  hydrotest / pigging efforts for 2001.     

In my opinion, the EOTT operations assignment has been a challenge for ETS. ETS - and Phil in particular - has dedicated tremendous effort to significantly enhance EOTT operations. Few could have tackled the EOTT operational challenges as well as Phil has. Besides the fact that it may not have been a popular decision at EOTT to relinquish control of Operations, he has done an outstanding job in keeping his staff focused on performance with integrity and quality, all the time within a financial framework that adds value to the overall picture of Enron and EOTT. It has not been easy. I am confident you recognize how well he has changed the face of operations in ETS and EOTT as you have changed the face of both organizations overall.

Best wishes for a good Thanksgiving.

Subject:	Cash Offers For Enron Wind Europe

Mark:

In the last two days, three private equity firms have told me they would be prepared to make all-cash offers for EW's European operations before December 31. These are Babcock & Brown (London), Alchemy (Frankfurt) and FBR (Washington DC).  Based on what I know about Enron Wind, I would bet that the price for the European operations alone would be signicantly more attractive for Enron than the price for the combined US and European operations.

I don't want to waste their time if it's too late. What should I tell them?

Subject:	Re: Business Review

I agree that makes a lot of sense, that is certainly where we are spending our
time, and good management of that so far, is what is contributing to earnings
higher than expected....that and the crazy California markets. We're always
glad to have you visit, and could provide a detailed discussion if that's what
you would prefer. We are spending a great deal of time on this in the sales
presentations and have a number of overheads, and some written information
that we use in our position meetings that we could send to you to start with.
The rate case is in a very dynamic state, but we believe moving in right
direction. The power position is in constant review based on projected loads,
demand side management opportunities, and blocks of energy available at
reasonable prices in the future for our customers. We are still operating
under an obligation to serve, as we don't see that changing anytime in the
near future and those utilities in the west that have gotten in trouble are
those who haven't provided for customers. Commissions seem to be giving rate
increases for increasing prices if prudent management was attempted, but not
just for stopping based on possible belief of dereg. We have a sharing
mechanism right now that shares risks and rewards between customers and
shareholders. During this sales process we had spent a lot of time working
through with Sierra on this, and now with the new possible buyers. Most like
it when they finally understand. It is not regulation 101, it is very complex
and leading edge, but get the risks and rewards aligned much better for
shareholdes and customers. Doesn't fit Enron's view of dereg, but Oregon will
not get to Enron's view anytime soon, especially with California situation,
and it's not just Oregon regulators, it's Oregon customers including the
industrials that are  reliability sensitive like high techs and health care. 
Sorry for the long note....how about if I start by sending you some
information from presentations, and then we can look at schedules for when a
meeting might work. You might even want to come to one of the banker
presentations. Mark M and Mitch were both in Seattle yesterday, and could
share with you some of the discussion related to these subjects. Mitch thought
we might have another in a week or so.....      

>>> Horton, Stanley 05/08/01 09:37AM >>>
After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE business
review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand better.  The
first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial exposures to
changing prices.  The second is the rate case.  I would be happy to return to
Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast of players.  I
am open to suggestions from you.

Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and
subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.

Thanks!

"hello 11/20","
Hi there.  Well, I got my accounting test back  and it wasn't that great.  I made a B.  I missed almost all my points  on one of the big problems.  I screwed up the formula and used the wrong  number as the denominator which made the whole problem wrong.  I was really  bummed and felt really stupid when she went over it.  My friend Missy sits  behind me and the exact same thing happened to her on the same problem so I  didn't feel so bad after that.  Our prof is going to substitute our lowest  test grade with our final exam grade which she said everyone always does  really well on so I still have an A in the class.  I was still ticked  though.  I know a B isn't bad but when it's because of one problem you  screwed up it's frustrating.  If I hadn't screwed up the problem I would  have had an A.  Other than that, today had been unexciting.  I'll be  home tomorrow night and can't wait!!!  I was thinking of coming over in the  morning on Thanksgiving Day and staying till noon.  Would that be ok?   I think the Saporitos are coming over at noon so I have to be back by  then.  Let me know what your plans are as far as thanksgiving day goes and  if my coming over in the morning is ok.  I love you!!!  Have fun with  Nick (hehehehe - or should I say good luck).  Tell Grandma Bettye hello and  I love her for me.  Talk to you tonight.
Love,
Caron

Thank you Cindy!   I check with Raveneaux this morning as I was already
there.  The Pro Shop said there was no tee time for Horton.   I am sure they
just over looked it.  Just in case however,  I reserved a 9:45 am on the New

"RE: Wind Co - PTC Update","A US/European split is possible, but difficult, especially in terms of our engineering organization which is organized globally, not regionally. For example, much of the engineering support for the Spanish EW 750s comes from the US team; much of the engineering support for the US EW 1.5s comes from Germany; our global blade r&d is in the US; etc.  I would hope that even with a down '02, we can identify buyers which will value the US business based on a medium-term view.

Stan,

I have the tax folks working away at the second issue you raise.  As I see it, there are two possible ways of splitting the business, if it makes tax sense to do so.  One would be manufacturing/projects and the other would be US/European.  As soon as I get clarity from the tax group, we should discuss.

Thanks, 
Mark

I would like to review the financial projections that will go into the teaser.  Also, have you and Mark discussed the possibility of seperating the US and Europeans business in any possible sale?  It seems to me that our North American business will be heavily discounted given current market conditions.  It may make since to see if this segment fits with the reorganization plan while preserving the European segment for divestiture.

Subject:	Wind Co - PTC Update

As you may know by now, Congress has adjourned without extending the PTC (see attached).  The Democrats would not support any extenders bill as leverage to get a Stimulus Package passed and everything died.  The Speaker has asked the President to call Congress back on Jan 2 to debate the Stimulus Package, but that seems unlikely. The best we can now hope for is that Congress takes up PTC either as part of the Stimulus Package or an Energy Bill in Feb/March '02.  

For the wind co, this is good and bad.  The good is that while the Enron BK has kept customers away, at least now none of our competitors can book orders either.  My hope is that PTC extension and the announcement of a new owner for EW will happen about the same time.  The bad news is that it means our US business will be further hurt - a 200 unit '02 is now out of reach and a 100-125 unit year may be the best we can hope for (assuming the PTC is extended in Q1).  (Maybe the Candover folks knew something we didn't, although I doubt it).  For sale purposes, we will run our '02 numbers at 150 units and put as positive a spin on it for bidders as we can.  Bottom line is that '02 will be a break-even to small profit year for us in the US.

Stan - we are in the process of revising our financial projections for a teaser to be sent out to bidders next week and this news will be reflected in those projections (meaning that the sale projections will now differ slightly from what we submitted to Enron earlier this week).  Also, we have launched reductions in force in the US.  I will reduce our MFG workforce by around 85 right after the first of the year and expect to have to let another 100-150 go early in Q1.  I will keep you posted.

Subject:	PTC UPDATE

The House members have left without passing an extenders bill. House Majority Leader Dick Armey refused to let the Extenders Package come to the House floor because he felt it wouls demonstrate to the Senate Democrats that the House Republicans were not serious about the Stimulus Package. Armey and Bill Thomas got into a shouting match on the floor as Thomas tried to get Armey to move the bill. Thomas and Rangel (the ranking Democrat on Ways and Means) had agreed on a one year extension which is also what the Senate Republicans would agree to.
This is partisan politics at its worst. There were no valid public policy reasons to not pass an extenders package 
Our only option at this point is to go back in January and try to get the extenders passed. They will be looking at an Economic Stimulus Package again if the economic conditions don't improve. There are 15 expiring provisions in the current bill so we will have alot of other groups fighting for extenders.
My apologies to all of you. I am devasted by this turn of events.
Hap

Subject:	Rawhide; Whitewing

Per our earlier discussion:

Rawhide - No prohibition on sale of assets.  TGS, CEG, Border (common units), Gaspart, Centragas and Subic/Batangas are primary assets in Rawhide.  EGF is in the process of restructuring deal prior to 12/14 deadline.  Demonstration of some velocity on the sale of these assets would be extremely beneficial in negotiations with banks.

Whitewing - Approval from investors needed if we sell below the Whitewing purchase price (book value).  Asset sales package would need to be prepared and sent to investors in Whitewing (Osprey) who then have 10 days to approve sale. Typically, this has not been a problem, however, circumstances have since changed.  Gordon McKillop manages this process for Enron.

I am familiar with both transactions have the contacts within Global Finance for additional detail if we need it.

The current thinking (and we just spoke with Chris Spencer about an hour ago) is to prepare for an auction while trying to get Candover in a position to moot an auction.

Hello Heath,
 
Thanks for returning my call.
 
The Wind Turbine Company (WTC) is interested in exploring the possiblity of taking over Enron Wind Corporation with the idea of selling off the European operations and all existing manufacturing operations.  We are interested in the company's North American wind operations and the properties held for development.
 
As you know, WTC is a small company, however, we are talking with a few large companies about investing in our company and prospectively taking an active role in the wind industry.  Enron Wind's existing windfarms would form an excellent operating base for us, providing properties to develop, and significant opportunities to deploy our new machines through the redevelopment of projects now employing the European style machine.
 
I would appreciate any guidance you provide.
 
Best regards,
 
Larry Miles

"FW: Rawhide; Whitewing","Stan:
 
This is first I have learned that EGAS assets are in Rawhide.  We have probably breached both shareholder and debt covenants on all of these assets.  It is obvious that global finance has long been out of control.  How can we run a business when we do not even know who owns the assets.  I will try to understand this better ASAP tomorrow.  Given our current dioscussions on Subic/Batangas it is critical.

"Wind Company","While I understand that the Wind Co is clearly a ""non-core"" asset for Enron,  I am very concerned about the apparent decision in Houston not to provide short-term liquidity for our operations (I have heard that the wind co is on its own for cash  going forward). While I am probably more eager than anyone to have the Wind Co regain its financial independence, I can not do it overnight and am worried about the potentially devasting impact which a lack of short-term capital will have on our business and, quite directly, the value of this asset to Enron.

 As you know, our lenders on IMI/Clear Sky have refused to fund a construction loan (they will not take Enron equity bridge risk) - this construction loan was the most important piece of our working capital/cash funding for Q4.  AEP and its lenders on IMI/Clear Sky are also expressing serious concern about the Enron warranty guaranty (we will likely have to reserve cash to secure our warranty obligations, further exacerbating our cash position).  FPL and AEP have in essence put on hold their deals with Enron Wind pending some clarity on how Enron's liquidity difficulties may affect Enron Wind.  AEP has gone as far as saying the Enron Wind is probably BK without working capital support from Enron, and are understandably asking why should they be comfortable with our performance risk?  Our European vendors, still mindful of Tacke's bankruptcy in 1997, are extremely concerned about our financial condition.  And a number of our counterparties who owe us money but are also owed money by Enron affiliates are seeking to set-off those obligations.  While I will have better numbers over this weekend, without the IMI/Clear Sky construction loan, I will need between $30-35mm through the end of the year (until the AEP sale closes) in order to meet our working capital needs.  Without that support, I can almost guaranty you I will not be able to sell IMI/Clear Sky to AEP and am worried about our short-term financial survival.  

Stan - this clearly has serious implications for the value of Enron Wind and our sales effort.  I am meeting again with my finance team (such as it is) over the weekend and on Monday morning.  I will set up some time with you on Monday or Tuesday to discuss.  I know there is no desire to support the Wind Co medium to long-term, but a decision to cut us off now could be fatal.

"","Stan,
       In response to your questions today:

            1. Research Group--while we do use them for options modeling and sanity checks, we employ two of their quant-jocks directly on NNG payroll (Sean Bolks being the lead).  As long as we keep these two, we could get by without them all together.

            2. Government Affairs--we only use one individual out of the Corporate Staff (Pat Shortridge).  Other than that, they provide no value.
      
            3. Aviation--will be used be my staff only is cost justified versus commercial (coach) flights.

            4. Strategic Sourcing--TAP does provide a cost effective service.  We could do without it, but I doubt we'd save money doing it ourselves.

"hello 11/27","Hi there Dad!!  How's today shaping up to be....better than yesterday I
hope??  My day has been okay.  Good news...I got a 23 out of a possible 25
on my b. law test from right before thanksgiving.  What the good grade means
is that I'm still making a strong A in there (a 94 I think) so I'm a very
happy girl.  Other than that my day has been quiet.  It's really getting
cold here and has been really windy which makes it seem colder.  I'm sure
you are getting this great weather as well by now so warning it's really
chilly.  Poor David went out to his car today and discovered he had a flat
tire from a nail that he must have picked up yesterday when we went to the
grocery store.  He's having AAA come fix it.  That's about all the exciting
news I have to report today.  I'll talk to you tonight.  I love you!!!!!!!!!

Attached below is the final report on NBP's 2001 objectives. I think it was a very successful and active year. I believe we have NBP on track to continue its growth in assets and earnings despite all the recent distractions. Of couse, there was concern with the level of Crestone/Bearpaw earnings, but I feel that group did a good job of dealing with a lot of changes and challenges given the acquisition and the energy markets. Much of the downside on Crestone was made up by beating plan significantly on NBPL.

If you would like more details or if you would like to see status reports for any of my divisions, let me know.

"ETS Year-end Performance Evaluation Process","
The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.  Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.  This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.

(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)

Feedback and Evaluation
Employees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.

?	PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7
?	Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14
?	Written evaluations due to HR			January 15

Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.

Compensation
Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.  Division Head approval is required.

As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.

Relative Talent Reviews
Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.  The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.  Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.  Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.  Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.  EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.  Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.

If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative.

"Per our discussion after your staff meeting today.","As related to ETS IT we would receive in summary:
	Enron Net Works:	$6,598,276
	ISC in support of SAP:	$5,964,000

The remainder of the note details the above summarized charges.

The allocation we would receive from  Enron Net Works for ETS is $6,598,276.  It is made up of three primary categories:

IT Infrastructure
	email
	internet support
	security
	EDI
	data center operations
	enterprise software licenses

Data Communications Support
	local area networks (LAN)
	wide area networks (WAN)

Voice Communications Support
	telephony

Three relevant areas of the $6,598,276 which are still being discussed are:
	depreciation charge of $1,593,976
	allocation for an enterprise portal for $94,660, we believe this project has been posponed indefinantly
	allocation for EnronOnline services of $416,575, we have had discussions regarding the allocation methodology which should put this allocation closer to 	$100,000


I have attached a spreadsheet that details the costs on an even more granular level.

 

If you would like me to complete a similar overview for EGS please let me know.

Thank you.

1. On the increase of the interim facility, we plan to communicate closing
on Friday before mkt opening.  We cannot
commit to forwarding a copy of this to Moody's on Thursday.
2. ok
3. This will be a wait and see.  We will not know the s/t impact until late
Jan; but the impact is not expected to be l/t.
4  There is no $12mm loss.  I indicated that the s/t impact may be a $1mm a
month reduction in gross margins (could be more or less!).  As I indicated,
this is a GUESS  on my part and will be confirmed during the 1st qtr.  (To
be sure that you are clear on this one: EOTT's monthly EOR & Pipeline
margins are impacted by many factors.  Availability of credit, although
important,  is lesser to the many other market factors, effectively managed
daily by our experienced operating, marketing and trading personnel.)  To
extrapolate this to a full  year $12mm would be wrong.   Additionally, we
have taken over commercial operations of the plant.  This will result in a
variance (higher or lower) to the $24mm in 2002 originally projected under
the tolling & storage agreements.  To take this to ZERO would be more than
wrong but ABSURD.

Again, as I have indicated in prior conversations, there is nothing from a
debt or liquidity standpoint that s/be pressuring Moody's to act now.  You
have already taken a downgrade once and further downgrade, in my opinion,
is not warranted until more concrete facts are known.  EOTT has significant
unencumbered assets which provide us many different options.  There is no
disintegration/doomsday capability as we are largely an asset company and
our profitability and cashflows, although impacted by our marketing, is
not, per se, dependent upon it on a l/t basis.

I continue to encourage Moody's to not overreact during this time that
supplier confidence and reassurances are very important to EOTT; but rather
to have their rating based upon the underlying facts and not speculation of
what might happen under worse case assumptions.  Even though the
environment has changed, I'm sure you agree that ratings are not determined
or maintained based upon these ""WORSE CASE"" type assumptions/scenarios.

Dear Lawrence,

Thank you for the updating phone conversation this morning. To summarize
some key points from today, as well as some points we've discussed far into
the past:

1. I was pleased to hear that you are going to sign an interim credit
agreement sometime tomorrow.  As I understand it, no later than tomorrow
(Thursday), EOTT will e-mail or fax to me an executed signed interim bank
credit facility enabling the issuance of $300 million in letters of credit
by this Friday, December 21.  This Friday is when EOTT needs to begin
posting L/C's in support of its January business. For all the reasons we
discussed, we must have this document to take to the standing EOTT rating
committee. I will try to have today's meeting postponed until Thursday but
early to mid Thursday afternoon will be the latest we could wait since EOTT
must be seen in the market to be normally issuing L/C's by Friday and this
need will grow in the ensuing days as January volumes are bid for.  We can
not think of a sound business or financial reason why the $300 million
facility would not be executed before then and this facility is important
to
your current ratings.

2. I understand that you continue to be confident the permanent working
capital and L/C facility would be completed around late January 2002.

3. You reiterated that EOTT will run its business at the volume of activity
that can be supported by $300 million of L/C support.  In the past, roughly
$1.5 billion of revenues were supported by L/C's equating to only 10% of
revenues due to prior success in expanding open account credit arrangements
with sellers/suppliers as well as the natural netting of receivables and
payables exposures with the same customer. EOTT believes it will be able to
run at the volume of business it targets with a $300 million facility.  As
I
mentioned, at least until the market settles down, we believe this will
require EOTT to reduce its level of business.  By cutting back on your
lower
margin business you may be able to limit the loss of EBITDA to in the range
of $1 million per month.

4. I understand that you would not expect EGLI to formally announce its
intentions on the tolling and storage take-or-pay agreements until January
2002 and that EOTT is working on a range of contractual alternatives with
other parties.  Moody's will have to treat as nil the revenue generating
potential of the MTBE, storage, and pipeline grid until alternative
arrangements with third parties are completed.

5. As I mentioned again, our rating reflects (1) the strength of your
liquidity and L/C arrangements and (2) longer term earnings, cash flow,
business risks, and sector risks of EOTT relative to its capital structure
and financial risks. Financial flexibility is pivotal and nailing down the
L/C arrangements is critical to keeping the current rating.  We will also
evaluate the longer term earnings potential relative to balance sheet debt,
any effective off-balance sheet debt and leases should they be utilized,
receivables monetizations, and inventory sale/repurchase agreements.  Until
the MTBE arrangements are made and until EOTT re-wins prior levels of open
account credit capacity, it seems that EOTT's annualized run-rate EBITDA
would be reduced by at least the missing $24 million from the MTBE assets
and the $12 million ($1 million/month) of lost margin due to reduced
volumes
and higher cost caused by living within your $300 million L/C ceiling and
incurring higher L/C fees.

Regards.

Andy Oram

Dear Lawrence and Susan,

I need to report back Wednesday to my bosses and to the EOTT rating
committee with an update on EOTT's banking arrangements and confirmed L/C
capacity, as well as provide insight into the other items covered in the
following e-mail I sent to you last Thursday.  Prior to tomorrow's meeting,
I'd hoped to have some feedback from you on the items discussed below.  I
would be grateful to pass along any information you would like me to
present
to tomorrow's rating committee.

Best regards.

Andy

Many thanks for the e-mail and phone message back.  I look forward to
speaking Monday for an update.  If you get a chance, it would be helpful to
receive further insight by Monday on the following issues:

1. You mentioned below that the pipeline segment needs little L/C support,
so we'll need to refine our own understanding of that.  We'd surmised that:
since the minority of pipeline revenue, as reported, comes from third
parties and the large majority of pipeline revenue is reported to be coming
from EOTT intersegment sources, the ""intersegment volumes"" come from part
of
the North America Crude Oil Segment's activity.  It would run some of its
volumes, at some point between the point of purchase and the point of
delivery, through the Pipeline segment. If that's the case, we'd assume
that
North American Crude Oil's needs to post L/C's or gain open account
standing
with the seller/producer should be counted as L/C's needed for Pipeline
throughput.  Substantial volumes is needed to generate Pipeline's reported
revenue (volume x roughly $0.74 tariff?) and the intersegment volumes and
values (crude price x volume) are quite large.  I'd be grateful if you
could
help us understand this a bit better.

2. To expand on your point #2 below, does that mean that Standard Chartered
is honoring the full $300 million of uncommitted arrangements to sell A/R
and inventory?  The hard sell I would have here is to state that Standard
Chartered is going to provide $600 million of interim credit availability
($300 million uncommitted and $300 million interim committed) to one
customer.  If so, great.  Also, is there some ability to satisfy your L/C
needs by posting cash in lieu of L/C's by selling more A/R under the
existing line?

3. RE any hedging activity on the Nymex, can you comment how much if any
cash is posted to support your hedging activity?

4. Regarding Enron's ownership, we assume Enron's interest in EOTT was
pledged to the lenders when Enron monetized its EOTT holdings.  I gather
that your comment #3 below states that the pledge of the Enron units and GP
interest do not complicate a sale of EOTT to an industry partner if that
were to become the optimal course of action?

Many thanks for any help you can provide.

Regards.

Andy

Got your voice message and was pleased to see that you were successful in
getting Moody's to take no action on this week.  We will call you on Monday
to clarify the LC facility status, which we expect to be favorable.  In the
interim let me address a few of your points:
1.  There is little LC capacity needed to support our pipeline revenues.
2.  Negotiations w/SC are for a committed LC facility for $300mm, which
have no impact on
   existing facilities.
3.  A transaction w/an industry player s/not be significantly impacted by
Enron's monetization of its equity interest, which
    do not include the GP.

Dear Lawrence,

I left two phone messages seeking information that would be helpful for an
internal meeting here at 1:30pm EST today on EOTT.  They generally cover:
(1) The bank negotiation status, L/C's, and combined open account and L/C
capacity needed to support the pipeline segment.  We have our assumptions
but I wanted to cross check this with you.
(2) Clarification to be sure that Standard Chartered is prepared to give
EOTT full access to both its $300 million uncommitted facility (about $198
million utilized as of 9/30/01) and its new committed short term $150
million letter of credit facility.
(3) A question or two on scenarios for doing a transaction with an industry
partner (also in light of Enron's earlier monetization of its interest in
EOTT as I discussed in further detail in phone message).

Any further information you might provide, beyond that from yesterday's
phone call, that would help us specify how EOTT will replace the credit
support (L/C's) beginning to roll-off next week would be helpful.  We
understand you are pursuing several alternatives that may take time to
formalize, but anything tangible you can give us now would be very helpful.

Thank you and best regards,

Andy Oram

I have the tax folks working away at the second issue you raise.  As I see it, there are two possible ways of splitting the business, if it makes tax sense to do so.  One would be manufacturing/projects and the other would be US/European.  As soon as I get clarity from the tax group, we should discuss.

I would like to review the financial projections that will go into the teaser.  Also, have you and Mark discussed the possibility of seperating the US and Europeans business in any possible sale?  It seems to me that our North American business will be heavily discounted given current market conditions.  It may make since to see if this segment fits with the reorganization plan while preserving the European segment for divestiture.

Subject:	Wind Co - PTC Update

As you may know by now, Congress has adjourned without extending the PTC (see attached).  The Democrats would not support any extenders bill as leverage to get a Stimulus Package passed and everything died.  The Speaker has asked the President to call Congress back on Jan 2 to debate the Stimulus Package, but that seems unlikely. The best we can now hope for is that Congress takes up PTC either as part of the Stimulus Package or an Energy Bill in Feb/March '02.  

For the wind co, this is good and bad.  The good is that while the Enron BK has kept customers away, at least now none of our competitors can book orders either.  My hope is that PTC extension and the announcement of a new owner for EW will happen about the same time.  The bad news is that it means our US business will be further hurt - a 200 unit '02 is now out of reach and a 100-125 unit year may be the best we can hope for (assuming the PTC is extended in Q1).  (Maybe the Candover folks knew something we didn't, although I doubt it).  For sale purposes, we will run our '02 numbers at 150 units and put as positive a spin on it for bidders as we can.  Bottom line is that '02 will be a break-even to small profit year for us in the US.

Stan - we are in the process of revising our financial projections for a teaser to be sent out to bidders next week and this news will be reflected in those projections (meaning that the sale projections will now differ slightly from what we submitted to Enron earlier this week).  Also, we have launched reductions in force in the US.  I will reduce our MFG workforce by around 85 right after the first of the year and expect to have to let another 100-150 go early in Q1.  I will keep you posted.

Subject:	PTC UPDATE

The House members have left without passing an extenders bill. House Majority Leader Dick Armey refused to let the Extenders Package come to the House floor because he felt it wouls demonstrate to the Senate Democrats that the House Republicans were not serious about the Stimulus Package. Armey and Bill Thomas got into a shouting match on the floor as Thomas tried to get Armey to move the bill. Thomas and Rangel (the ranking Democrat on Ways and Means) had agreed on a one year extension which is also what the Senate Republicans would agree to.
This is partisan politics at its worst. There were no valid public policy reasons to not pass an extenders package 
Our only option at this point is to go back in January and try to get the extenders passed. They will be looking at an Economic Stimulus Package again if the economic conditions don't improve. There are 15 expiring provisions in the current bill so we will have alot of other groups fighting for extenders.
My apologies to all of you. I am devasted by this turn of events.

I wanted to thank you again for your guidance through my recent organizational changes.  I want you to know that I am in firm support of wherever you carry the flag, no matter what it may say on that flag.  If you need me and my team to take a hill, we'll make it happen.

Others in the group appreciated my staying, as presented in the following notes, but I would not have been in the position to make this decision without your support.

You and the family have a well deserved Happy Thanksgiving.

Appreciatively,
Steve

Good morning Daddy!!!  How are you today?  Did you enjoy your nice long weekend?  Did Debbie tell you about the golf tournament Mark Martin is hosting in New Smyrna the week you'll be there that you can play in or at least watch?  If not, I'll tell you all about it tonight.  Have a great day, and I'll talk to you tonight.  By the way, let me know if you have any days free for lunch this week.  I love you!!

Mr. Horton,

We appreciate your time a few weeks ago and sincerely hope we were able to
clearly convey our disciplined investment approach to you during our
meeting.    We also hope we were able to help you to re-define the term
""risk"".   Using our disciplined approach, we have been able to provide our
clients with consistent returns
and avoid negative returns over the course of the past 10 years.  We credit
the success to developing and implementing a very focused and structured
investment plan.

At this point, we would like to have your permission to put together a
proposal for a portfolio which would be constructed upon the same philosophy
and guidelines utilized by Yale University's multi-billion dollar endowment
fund.    The purpose of the proposal would be to show you how we build our
client portfolios
in an attempt to minimize ( if not eliminate ) negative annual returns while
providing above market returns.

We know you would find the proposal interesting and would give you better
insight into how
high net worth individuals, endowments and wealthy family groups construct
their investment
portfolios.

We look forward to hearing back from you.  Have a great day.


Sincerely,


William L Swearingen II  /  Vice President		David J. Swearingen

Subject:	PGE Position Report

I would appriciate if you would send to me each week the PGE Position Report.  Also, at your convenience I would like to spend some time via telephone to run through the report to make sure I understand just what is being reported.  I'll have my assistant call to set-up the phone call early next week.

Also, to whom in Risk Management do you send the position report?

Thanks.

"Wessex Weekly Update","Stan

The week has been dominated by speculation on the future of Wessex and calls
from potential buyers.  I had a contact from Mark Muller from Enron asking
for information about potential buyers.  This was subsequently followed up
by a guy called Jeff Golden who says he works for Mark and is co-ordinating
the activity on Wessex.  I have agreed with John and Michael the attached
note which I have sent to Jeff Golden who says he is happy with the process
and will act as the co-ordinator for the office of the Chairman.

As I see it, at this stage, we are saying to potential acquirers of Wessex
that although Wessex will be for sale, the timing is not yet determined.  In
the meantime, we will seek the information set out in paragraph D3 so that
when a decision is made we are in a position to move quickly.

The only other action I am aware of is that RBS have a meeting with Jeff
McMahon next week.

I will keep you updated.

Colin

"FW: Guam Information","Jim/Stan;
See below; this is simply further illustration of the problems we will continue to have with this gentleman.  He has simply received royal treatment in terms of the expediency with which information has been provided to him.  I have met with him twice already and have spoken to him on the phone at least three times.  Clearly, based on the email below he is trying to line up investors to do this deal.  You know what my recommendation on this is; I have simply wanted to take a very courteous and responsive approach on this out of respect for the relationship.

Let me know how your mtg with Corp Development went.

Thanks! Mariella
ps: fyi - after fulfilling his round of requests (which came up on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving) I asked if he could please focus on: how to deal with the backstop guarantees that ENE has in the deal and a financing plan (I politely told him we were looking at an all-cash transaction).

"Flawed Advice & the Management Trap","To extend your complimentary strategy+business subscription at no charge, go to: http://www.sbsubscriber.com/services/cg.cfm?D=20010605163716&N=4232025.0&R=155.0

Dear Mr Stanley C. Horton:

There's plenty of advice for managers floating around out there...some of it very good and some of it downright disastrous.  The trick, of course, is knowing which is which.

That's exactly what Harvard professor Chris Argyris proposes to show you in his new book, Flawed Advice and the Management Trap: How Managers Can Know When They're Getting Good Advice and When They're Not.  For more details, read the book review section in the current issue of strategy+business.

In the same issue, you'll find a generous handful of other great books discussed. The Knowing-Doing Gap: How Smart Companies Turn Knowledge into Action is a good example...so is Silicon Valley's New Immigrant Entrepreneurs, by AnnaLee Saxenian.  And you won't want to miss the s+b review of The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life or Absolut: Biography of a Bottle.

Reviews of important business books are just part of the reason strategy+business is eagerly awaited by the select group of influential senior executives to whom we regularly send complimentary issues.

While we're on the subject of complimentary issues, I should mention that our records indicate you have been receiving s+b since Jun 13 00.  There is no reason why you cannot keep receiving strategy+business absolutely free...especially if you make arrangements now.

To make sure you continue receiving your complimentary strategy+business subscription, just click on the following link:

http://www.sbsubscriber.com/services/cg.cfm?D=20010605163716&N=4232025.0&R=155.0

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,

As SGA staff liaison to the committee, I would like to extend a formal
invitation to have you join us.  Sandy Comish, CIO at Williams Gas Pipeline
recently joined, and we would love to add you to the list as well.  Your

"Accessing your Outlook e-mail at home","Stan:

	Cindy informed me that your are having some difficulties accessing your Outlook e-mail from home and from locations outside the Enron Building.  Here are some instructions that will help you get in:

1) Make sure you are connected to the Enron network.  If you are at home and use dialup to get into Enron, dialin as you normally would to get the connection.  If you are in another Enron office, you should be fine.
2) Open Internet Explorer.  By default, this usually takes you to home.enron.com.  Change the address to mail.enron.com.
3) A login screen will appear, asking for an ID and a password.  In the ID box, type CORP\shorton (case is not important). 
4) In the password blank, type in your network password.  This is the password you use to login to your machine each morning.  When you change your network password, your Outlook password will automatically change with it.
5) You should now see your Outlook inbox.  You can access your mail, your calendar, and your contacts.  


If you have any further questions, please let me know.

The attached document titled ""Retention-EGS""  is the list of essential employees that Stan Horton has approved for inclusion in a retention program.  

The document titled ""Divest"" includes EGS employees that currently have retention or divestiture agreements in place and are not in need of additonal consideration.  I understand that there are additional PGE employees with agreements that I have not listed and that you have access to those names.

Additional names of EGS/International employees will be coming from Scott Gilchrist after he gets with Jim Hughes this afternoon.

Subject:	Weekly Update May 7-11, 2001 

-Presentation to potential buyer went well. Questions mostly around power
supply trading, and risk/reward formula with customers and shareholders, that
is in agreement with OPUC.
-California's rolling black-outs have pushed up prices in the West, allowing
opportunities for PGE to continue to sell into the market.
-All IOUs, State Agencies (OR,ID,WA), Power Councils, BPA, and security
coordinator met to address emergency preparedness. There is beginning to be
heightened concern about Fall and Winter supply.
-Union negotiations continued, and progress was made understanding needs and
issues. Next meeting scheduled for May 21. Union seems to be in no hurry, and
needs for time to get interests aligned.
-De-reg Bill continues to be uncertain. It has become a political football,
where legislatures are convinced, who ever carries or doesn't carry forward,
depending on future power situation, will determine which party ends up in
majority, and as governor in the state. Politics....ugh
-Final contracts should be received tomorrow. Will work to turn them around as
quickly as possible, but I know people will need a few days with them, and a
few more issues may need to be addressed. There are some employment
agreements, and other contracts that were put in place by others, that have
created some benefits, that people feel they are giving up with new
agreements. Some is perception, some is real, some is lack of trust for
Enron's  intent, when things are not written precisely.

Subject:	Wessex Water


Stan,

I met with Colin Skellet, Wessex Water CEO, last week and we agreed that
Wessex Water and Enron Direct should help each other going forward.  Wessex
will provide ED with its I&C database and, should Wessex decide to enter
into the residential power and gas market, ED could provide site
registration and gas/power price risk management services to sit behind the
Wessex brand.

Given that Wessex is Enron's biggest retail platform in Europe, have you
given any thought as to how it could be closer integrated with Enron Direct
generally?  Given current market conditions, I expect Enron will have
little choice but to hold onto Wessex for the time being which isn't
necessarily a bad thing.

There could obviously be some regulatory issues in bringing our retail
water and energy businesses together, though I think it is worth looking
at.  ED has 150,000 I&C customers across the UK, making it a good fit for
Wessex.  Also, if the Water market opens up to competition in the future,
there would be benefits for Wessex.

I look forward to discussing ideas with you when you are over in June.

Matthew

We received the two deposits you expected this week. The amount of the
larger one was not the number you gave me. Take a look at client serve and
see if it is correct.

"May 28,2001 Weekly report","-Presentation scheduled in San Francisco on Friday to possible buyer.
-Prices down in power and gas markets. No  extreme loads,  thermal generation
returning from outages, and increasing water flows all have contributed.
-18 month delay of deregulation in Oregon passed by House. Hard to predict
what Senate will do. Probably won't know until end of session, or possibly
even until possible Governor action. Still planning to be able to move forward
Oct 1 if necessary, but doing more work manually, as opposed to all systems
being ready, as there don't appear to be many customers who will take action.
-Working on contingency plans for possible rolling blackouts this summer, with
other regional suppliers. Lastest customer surveys show willingness to accept
short/infrequent outages(at least on a temporary basis), if it will keep costs
lower, until supply issues are resolved.  
-Still working with BPA on Colstrip transmission issues. Meeting scheduled
with Administrator next week.
-Jack Urquhart and Robert Eickenroht toured Trojan, and received an update on
Nuclear activities, as part of their continuing review. They seemed pleased
with the good progress that is being made on decommissioning.

Subject:	Proposal to Change ""Commercial Support"" peer group label to ""Professional Services""

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small circle of people.

David

Attached are the resumes of the key people that have worked with me for the last year and half.  They are Marc Hensel, Martin Sacchi, Bradford Brooks and Corbin Barnes.  I believe they are some of the brightest commercial people at Enron, and in particular have a lot of experience with corporate development, M&A, asset purchases and sales (including international experience).  They are also incredibly hard working people.

"FW: Rawhide project","Gentlemen:
 
The info below is a little confusing.  I was never informed until now that anything of EGAS was in Rawhide.  If this is true and Enron has conveyed these assets to a structured vehicle, then we have breached transfer obligations on almost every deal, our debt may be in default and we need to understand the consequences asap as Subic and Batangas are the subject of current negotiations.

Jim, 

Because of the nature of what they asked, I just wanted to keep you informed on this.  

Global Finance has requested models, historicals, timings for disposal on the Rawhide assets.  These assets include Subic, Batangas, Guam, Gaspart, Centragas, PQPC, and TGS.  I was going to get them the info on the models and ask for Carol Howes' help on the historicals.  If neccessary, I will also set them up with people over here who can help explain the valuations.

All:

Today marks a tremendous milestone in that the letter that confirms the
""Pipeline Industry"" has joined together to address regulatory and
legislative pipeline safety issues in a unified fashion has been delivered
to the Secretary of Transportation, Norman Mineta, via courier.  These
documents were also sent to select Senators, Congressmen and Staff.  You,
as
signatory to this letter, acting as CEO's, Chairman of Boards & Executive
Committees of Associations, CEO's & Presidents of the Associations and
Institutes, and Industry Leaders, confirm the path forward for the entire
industry and collectively we represent the entire industry.  We need to
roll
out this confirmation to all the industry stakeholders and encourage the
use
of these documents to advance our efforts.  A follow-up face-to-face
session
with Secretary Mineta and a few of the CEO's will be worked into  his busy
schedule as soon as possible.

A copy of the signed document went out in the mail to you today and a
electronic copy (without the signatures) is attached for your convenience.
Also attached is the ""One-Pager"" that accompanied the letter and a Industry
news release.

Congratulations to all who made this possible.

To you and yours.....Happy Thanksgiving.

Dear Board Task Force,
Bill Boswell also noted the following conversation that occurred today:

""Rae -- and just to fill in the blanks, Betsy Moler called this morning to say
that Mike McGrath had called her seeking support for his position.  She told
him his position was wrong and that the EEI board members wanted to work on
the strawman first and to have something to look at in June on that - not
the retail quadrant - although the two efforts could proceed at the same
time.  Owens and I agreed to talk on Monday following the NERC meeting to
set up an EEI/GISB board level meeting ASAP.  Mike will not be a part of
that effort; Dave Owens will. -- Bill""

I need some guidance regarding NEPCO.   We will try to determine if there is any sale value, however, in the meantime all the projects we are bidding require Enron credit support and guaranties of performance.  Without the credit support/guaranties of performance NEPCO is essentially in a wind down status which would be very costly.  From a cash and valuation standpoint business as usual is the best approach.  Just need some guidance from you.  Sorry to bother you with this but I am already getting inquiries.  FPL called today since we are bidding on two of their merchant plants.  They will probably want to talk with one of you regarding our position.

"JosephToman Investigation","Stan -   As you know, Joseph Toman sent a variety of e-mails and faxes to various members of Enron management on November 21, alleging safety, discrimination and other violations at Enron Wind.  We commenced an internal investigation over the Thanksgiving holiday and, although a few interviews still need to be conducted, we have a fairly good sense for the facts.  Here is the summary:

	1.  Joseph Toman is a temporary engineering employee (hired for a short-term assignment through a temp agency), not an Enron Wind full-time employee.  He employer is the temp agency, not Enron Wind.  

	2.  Toman started in August, 2001 for an assignment expected to last several months.  

	3.  Last week, his supervisor told Toman that his project work was ending as expected and his services would not be needed after November 26.  His memos were sent after that meeting with his supervisor.  Toman's temp employment has, in fact, ended today - November 26.

	4.  In conducting an interview with Toman, Toman told our HR VP that unless his employment was extended, he would not cooperate with us in explaining the specifics of his safety and other concerns. 

	5.  Other employees generally viewed Toman as uncooperative and not a team player.

Based on the facts we have uncovered so far, I do not feel there is a need for further action.  We will complete this investigation and I will let you know if we uncover any additional and/or contrary facts.

"FW: Important Project Announcements from the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets","
The California Electricity Crisis has resulted in an avalanche of
opportunity for the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets (CAEM) to
provide its views on energy restructuring. Below you will find links to some
of our recent documents:

 - In May, CAEM issued an update to the RED Index 2001 that now includes the
13 provinces and territories of Canada. The RED Index is a scorecard which
evaluates and reports on the progress states are making in electricity
restructuring. Link: http://www.caem.org/red_index_2001.htm

 - USA Today did a full page spread using CAEM's RED Index to give a summary
of activity in the top 25 states. Link:
http://www.usatoday.com/money/consumer/2001-02-01-energy-full.htm

 - The Governor of Pennsylvania included the RED Index Rank of Pennsylvania
in his State-of-the-State Address. Link:
http://www.caem.org/news/PA%20Governor%20Press%20Release.PDF

 - The NY PSC issued a Press Release on the RED Index. Link:
http://www.caem.org/news/NY%20Press%20Release%202001.pdf

 - CAEM is pleased to announce the formation of a public-private sector
project called the Distributed Energy Task Force. At the request of
important members of Congress, CAEM will be assessing opportunities for
promotion of distributed energy technologies and matching those
opportunities with policy instruments, i.e., tax incentives, funds for R&D
etc. For a copy of the project description and participation information,
email a request to jwimberly@caem.org.

 - In February, CAEM sponsored a meeting of the newly formed Leadership
Council on Energy Restructuring, an umbrella group of industry executives
and public sector officials who support the development of a coherent
strategy on energy restructuring.
Link:  ftp://ftp.caem.org/leadership_council_description.pdf

 - In April, CAEM filed comments with the FTC on the proceeding that was
initiated at the request of House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman
Billy Tauzin on the impact of States restructuring. Link:
ftp://ftp.caem.org/FTC-Comments.PDF

 - In March, CAEM held its first meeting of the DISCO of the Future Forum.
We have posted several documents from that Forum. Link:
http://www.caem.org/disco_of_the_future.htm

 - Last Sunday, the Philadelphia Inquirer published the views of CAEM on
President Bush's Energy Plan.
Link:
http://inq.philly.com/content/inquirer/2001/05/20/opinion/MALLOY20.htm?templ

Subject:	Project Timber

I am preparing the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing for Enron Corp. in connection with the sale of the MTBE/Isomerization facility to EOTT Energy Partners, L.P.  I believe that the filing should be made by this Friday, May 25 in order to be sure that the 30 day waiting period will expire before the anticipated closing date of June 29.  Please read the attached memo which requests that each of you look through your files to determine whether or not you possess the types of documents described in the memo.  I would be happy to discuss any questions that you may have regarding whether or not particular documents in your files would be responsive to this request.  Since Enron needs to make this filing by Friday, it is important that you respond to the memo by Thursday, May 24.

Subject:	Confidential - GSS Organization Value to ETS


Here are my thoughts on the value the GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) brings to ETS:

I believe totally in the concept of strategically sourcing our materials and services for ETS, which is the concept that GSS was founded under, while still within the ETS organization.  Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS.   The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are:

*	The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine.
*	Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000.
*	ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more.
*	New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's.
*	Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy).
*	GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing.
*	ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register.


If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals)

*	Two (2) negotiators - Contract Managers
*	Two (2) analysts
*	Two (2) contract administrators

The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC:

*	iBuyit System
*	Catalog system (part of iBuyit)
*	iPayit system

We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department.   This would take very few staff adds to make that happen.

Let me know if you need any further detail.

"it's the weekend!!!!!!!!!!","
Hey Daddy!!!!!!!  I'm so glad it's finally the  weekend after this long week involving entirely too many tests!!!  I bet  you're thankful for the weekend too considering your life is much more stressful  than mine at the moment!!  So what are your plans for the weekend -  golfing, sleeping, watching a race or two and trying to relax??  I don't  know what I'm doing this weekend - probably nothing exciting.  I can't wait  for Thanksgiving!!  It'll be so nice to be home for longer than a  weekend.  Oh by the way................I GOT A 92 ON MY STATS  TEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was really excited.  I didn't expect to get  it back today since we just took it Wednesday but we got it!!  I was so  happy because I was really expecting a B instead of an A this time.  I've  decided my brain must understand this better than I consciously thought it  did!!  Anyway, I was happy, and I hope the news brightens your day.  I  took my accounting test today and think I did pretty well.  It was the  hardest and longest one we've taken so far, but I still think I did well.   Our teacher drops our lowest test grade too so if it's not an A, it'll get  dropped.  I'm sure it's an A or B though since accounting and I seem to get  along well. :)  Have a great rest of the day, and I'll talk to you  tonight.  I love you!!!
Love,
Caron

"ENA Deepwater GOM Opportunities","
Stan,

Since returning to Enron, I have been working in ENA's Upstream Business Unit.  For the past year we have been pursuing infrastructure opportunities in the deepwater GOM.  The infrastructure projects consisted of deepwater pipelines and floating production systems such as spars or tension leg platforms.  Recently, ENA has re-evaluated its business strategy in deepwater and is questioning the amount of exposure ENA should take given its ownership position in Mariner.  ENA may not view offshore infrastructure as a strategic business opportunity for Enron.  

I would like to meet with you to discuss current and future deepwater project developments in the Gulf of Mexico.  These projects may represent a significant opportunity for EOTT.  I have worked with EOTT extensively to determine the best crude oil export option for each projects.  

In addition, if ENA determines that deepwater infrastructure projects are not strategic, I would be interested in your opinion regarding opportunities with ETS for someone with my experience.  I have attached my resume for your convenience.

 

Could your administration assistant call and set up a time for the brief meeting?


Thanks .... Kevin Miller

"Draft letter to Indian lenders","The Enron Dabhol team intends to meet with GE and Bechtel early next week and seek/obtain their approval on putting a joint offer on the table regarding what we would accept for our Dabhol investment. This will include price and other terms of the offer. We need to buy some time for the sponsor meetings to occur next week as well as correctly position the current status in the press. Currently, there is considerable Indian and international wire service press that is saying that Enron, GE and Bechtel have agreed to participate in an equity sale on the terms and for the price range outlined by the Indian banks. This is clearly not the case, and I recommend we give a firm push back on this, while keeping the door open for a subsequent offer from the sponsors. Below is a letter I intend to send to the Indian banks on Tuesday morning, India time. The summary of the letter is that it tells the Indian banks that we are meeting with Enron, GE and Bechtel next week and will be jointly deciding our next steps, including what we are willing and not willing to do. And we will communicate this back to the banks after our meetings next week.

Letter  will go to IDBI, ICICI and State Bank of India.

""Gentlemen:

I trust your Diwali holiday season was enjoyable, and I wish each of you a very happy and successful year ahead. 

Following our meetings in Singapore, we will be meeting jointly with the offshore sponsors to discuss the next steps with them and get their approval on how to proceed. These meetings will discuss the various options available to the offshore sponsors that we have mentioned to you in the past, including whether they wish to proceed with a due diligence process and on what terms, especially given the very low indications of value proposed by the Indian financial institutions in Singapore as well as the absence of funding of ongoing costs of Dabhol Power by the lenders. Until we have those offshore sponsor meetings, we will not rule out any possibilities and will work for the best possible outcome that protects the economic value in the Dabhol project.  

As you are aware, just as this past week was a major holiday week in India, this current week is a major holiday week in the United States. Thus our meetings with the offshore sponsors are scheduled for November 26 through 29 in the U.S. 

As soon as the offshore sponsors have formulated their views, we will communicate the same to you. I anticipate this will be during the week of December 3.

Regards,


K. Wade Cline

PIPELINE NOTES FROM WASHINGTON
Vol. 4, No. 45
November 16, 2001

Association of Oil Pipe Lines
(202) 408-7970
(202) 408-7983 (fax)
bcooper@aopl.org

The opinions if any expressed in these notes are the author's only and do
not represent the views of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines (but they
should).


 1.	Congressional Republicans Plan to Push Energy Stalls

The expected move by Senate Republicans to offer H.R.4, the House-passed
energy bill, as an amendment to the Senate's version of economic stimulus
legislation stalled this week, and the stimulus package itself was put off
until Congress returns after Thanksgiving.  It became known that Majority
Leader Trent Lott (R-MS) would not support any amendments that would delay
the stimulus legislation.  Bush Administration Office of Management and
Budget Director Mitchell Daniels offered the opinion that the Senate should
develop its own energy bill and dismissed H.R.4 as ""essentially a tax relief
bill"".  We still expect negotiations to be concluded on terms for addressing
energy legislation in the Senate next February, but it is less clear when
the agreement will be reached.  And we still expect the Senate to add the
McCain pipeline safety bill to its energy legislation when it does take up
the subject, thereby bringing the pipeline safety issue before the House in
a perhaps more compelling way than heretofore. Meanwhile, key House Members
continue working on pipeline safety legislation, but nothing new has been
introduced in the form of a bill in the House and no drafts have been
released for comment.   We are urging these House members to put something
out around which we can rally.  With Congress gone for Thanksgiving week, we
have just have to wait to see if anything like this will happen this year.

2.	Transportation Appropriations to Move

Meanwhile we expect the Transportation Appropriations conference to
reconvene soon after Congress returns, resolve the Mexican truck issue that
has been holding things up and pass a bill that will include significantly
increased funding for the Office of Pipeline Safety relative to the current
level.  A copy of the House and Senate bills and Committee reports can be
accessed at http://thomas.loc.gov/home/approp/appover.html.  Scroll down to
Transportation, H.R.2299.

3.	OPS Interview Draws Favorable Austin American-Statesman Editorial

	Office of Pipeline Safety head Stacey Gerard was interviewed by the Austin
American-Statesman last week.  The interview apparently did some good
because in an editorial on November 13 the American-Statesman concluded ""The
assurance of Stacey Gerard that her agency is 'working hard on a number of
fronts' is encouraging.  The director's small agency, located in the
Department of Transportation, appears ready to do a better job.  Congress
should provide encouragement and funding.  The regulated industry should
cooperate.  Citizens should be watchful.""  See
http://www.austin360.com/auto_docs/epaper/editions/tuesday/editorial_3.html
-- Pipelines require caution two ways

4.	Speculation on Regulation of Gathering Lines

>From the same interview, speculation on prospects for regulating gathering
lines:   http://www.austin360.com/statesman/editions/today/news_1.html --
Comprehensive regulation unlikely for rural pipelines

5.	Commission Expands Electronic Filing Options

	With the current anthrax scare and the related disruption to Washington, DC
mail service, Chairman Wood has asked Chief Information Office Fernanda
Young to accelerate the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission's electronic
filing effort.  CIO Young has responded, with a notice issued late Friday
significantly expanding the list of documents that will be accepted with
electronic filing.  Among these are motions, answers to motions, requests
for rehearing, settlement comments, requests for production and production
of documents and answers to complaints.  One of the few documents that must
still be filed in hard copy is a complaint.  For more on the Commission's
initiative, see the Friday order at
http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\CIPS\RULES\RM\RM00-12.00D.TXT.  The User's Guide on
electronic filing may be accessed at www.ferc.gov using the E-Filing link.

6.	FERC Schedules Olympic for Consideration

	The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission agenda for its meeting of November
20, 2001 indicates that it plans to take up Tosoro's request to suspend
Olympic Pipe Line's cost-of-service rates for a full seven months (docket
number IS01-441-002).   The Commission had suspended the rates for one day
and then allowed them to go into effect subject to refund.  We will let you
know what the Commission decides to do.

7.	Calnev Asks for Rehearing

	Calnev this week asked the Commission to look again at its October 15 order
stating the complainant ARCO does not need to allege reasonable grounds for
asserting that the rate increase is so out of line with actual cost
increases as to be unjust and unreasonable (i.e. rule 343.2(c)(1)).  Calnev
believes that is the very test that needs to be met.  It also points out
that the Commission's recent order in SFPP (docket number OR92-8-012,
http://rimsweb1.ferc.gov/rims.q?rp2~rimsdocinfo~2222355) merely confuses
things further by adding a cost-of-service measure that was not there
previously.
In the alternative, Calnev asks the Commission to clarify its standards of
pleading and proof for challenging (i) rates grandfathered under EPAct; (2)
rate increases resulting from indexing; and (3) increases above the
grandfathered level adopted prior to indexing.  A copy of the Calnev request
can be found at http://rimsweb1.ferc.gov/rims.q?rp2~rimsdocinfo~2223723.
The docket number is OR01-8-001.

8.	FERC Changes Web Links

	The Commission has retired its old website and will now only use the
website at www.ferc.gov.   This change also affects our regularly used links
to CIPS and to RIMS.  The new link to the Commission Issuance Posting System
is http://cips.ferc.gov/cips/default.htm.  The Remote Information Management
System is now accessible at http://rimsweb1.ferc.gov/rims.q?rp2~intro.

9.	Longhorn Opposition Results in a Study

http://www.austin360.com/statesman/editions/today/news_14.html -- Texas
lawmakers ordered to study pipeline issues

10.	CEQ Sends Inquiry to FERC

	As many of you know, the Council on Environmental Quality is looking at
ways to streamline permitting for energy projects.   Last month, they
collected suggestions from the public on energy projects that might benefit
from their oversight.  Colonial Pipeline brought to their attention the
Colonial expansion project into Tennessee.  Last week, the CEQ sent an
inquiry to the FERC, probably among other affecting agencies, asking the
FERC to identify any unresolved issues related to the project and FERC
contacts.  A copy of the CEQ request can be found at
http://rimsweb1.ferc.gov/rims.q?rp2~getImagePages~2222806~46~3~1~50.

11.	EPA Publishes Boutique Fuels White Paper

	The EPA announced in the Federal Register of November 14, 2001 the
availability of its study on the impact of boutique fuels on product supply
and its proposal to smooth the seasonal transition in fuel types.  The EPA
is seeking comments on this document through December 31, 2001.  You may
find a copy of the EPA notice at page 57099 at
http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/fedreg/a011114c.html or on the EPA website
at http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fuels.htm.

Gentlemen:
 
The info below is a little confusing.  I was never informed until now that anything of EGAS was in Rawhide.  If this is true and Enron has conveyed these assets to a structured vehicle, then we have breached transfer obligations on almost every deal, our debt may be in default and we need to understand the consequences asap as Subic and Batangas are the subject of current negotiations.

Jim, 

Because of the nature of what they asked, I just wanted to keep you informed on this.  

Global Finance has requested models, historicals, timings for disposal on the Rawhide assets.  These assets include Subic, Batangas, Guam, Gaspart, Centragas, PQPC, and TGS.  I was going to get them the info on the models and ask for Carol Howes' help on the historicals.  If neccessary, I will also set them up with people over here who can help explain the valuations.

"District Cooling Project - Project Financing","We are in the process of closing with US Bank on our financing for the
construction of the first phase of this project for $13 million.  We are
working with the Enron Corp. - Corporate Financing group to obtain a corporate
guarantee for the financing.  This project is currently in PGH2 and is part of
what is being sold with PGE.  The financing guarantee will contemplate this
sale and will allow for the assignment of the guarantee to the new buyer as
long as they meet an agreed upon financial standards (ie. BBB+).  Since we are
under ETS you or Stan might get questions on the project and I wanted to
provide you an overview of the project.

Mahendra Shah of our treasury group has had a conversation with Greg Caudell
and Jim Newgard (both report to Tm Despain) at Enron Corp. Corporate Finance
about the Enron Guaranty for the US Bank construction facility (up to $13
million). He has forwarded to them, the US bank's draft of the Enron guaranty.
 They indicated that the guaranty would probably be redrafted by Clement
Abrams using the standard Enron format.  
 
If you have any questions on the District Cooling Project or need additional
information we can set up a conference call and go over the various aspects of
the project.  We also have the financial model available that we can forward
to you that was reviewed and was the basis of Enron's approval.

"Employee Development/Growth","Stan,

I had the opportunity to participate in the Table Talk session yesterday at
EOTT and want to follow up with you on the topic of employee growth and
development.  Thanks to EOTT's tuition reimbursement program, I will be
completing my undergraduate degree this summer at UST (although I ""walked""
two weeks ago).  My degree is in General Studies (concentrations in
Business Administration and International Studies).  I am graduating Summa
Cum Laudeand received the Outstanding Graduate award in my degree program,
along with honors in English, Philosophy and Adult Education.  I intend to
start the MBA program at UST in Spring 2002.

I would like to find a position within your organization where I can learn
the business, provide value to the company as well as advance myself.  I
mention that I am graduating with honors not to pat myself on the back but
to impress upon you that I will apply the same focus and desire for
excellence in any position I undertake.  Naturally, I would like to stay
within the Enron companies not only because I have 7 years invested
already, but because Enron is the place to work and grow.  I am open to any
position where there is an opportunity for learn, grow and advance.  As
with my studies, I find the more I become aware of and learn, the more I
want to learn.  I know I could do a great job within an organization given
the opportunity.

Any advice or assistance in finding a position or internship would be
greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

PIPELINE NOTES FROM WASHINGTON
Vol. 4, No. 21
June 1, 2001

Association of Oil Pipe Lines
(202) 408-7970
(202) 408-7983 (fax)
bcooper@aopl.org

The opinions if any expressed in these notes are the author's only and do
not represent the views of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines (but they
should).

1.	FERC Commissioners confirmed by the Senate Friday May 25

	We missed the news last Friday that the Senate had confirmed the
nominations of Nora Mead Brownell of Pennsylvania and Patrick Henry Wood III
of Texas to be Commissioners of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
They are now official, and the Commission is at full voting strength.
Members need to get in to see these new Commissioners.

2.	President Announces Intent to Nominate DOT General Counsel and RSPA Head

President Bush announced this week that he intends to nominate Kirk Van Tine
to be General Counsel of the Department of Transportation.  Van Tine is
currently a Partner with the law firm of Baker and Botts in Washington,
D.C., where he is in charge of the firm's litigation process.  A former
member of the U.S. Navy, he is a graduate of the Naval Academy and the
University of Virginia Law School.
The President also announced the intention to nominate Ellen G. Engleman to
be Administrator of the Research and Special Programs Administration at the
Department of Transportation.  She currently serves as President and CEO of
Electricore, Inc., a non-profit research and development consortium that
develops advanced transportation and energy technologies through federal
public/private partnerships.  From 1993 to 1994 she was the Director of
Corporate and Government Affairs for Direct Relief International and was a
Public Affairs Executive with GTE from 1987 to 1992.  A resident of
Indianapolis, Indiana, she is a graduate of Indiana University, received a
law degree from Indiana University Law School and a Master's of Public
Administration from Harvard University.

We don't know any more at this moment about these important nominees than is
in the White House press release:
http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/05/20010531-7.html.

3.	Bush Energy Executive Orders

Here are the links so you can read the first Executive Orders issued to
implement parts of the Bush Energy Plan for yourself:
http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/05/20010518-6.html and
http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/05/20010518-5.html.

4.	OPS to Host Integrity Management Workshops

Put this on your calendars.  API tells us the Office of Pipeline Safety will
be conducting two public workshops to assist operators in developing an
understanding of the integrity management rulemaking, OPS expectations
related to the rulemaking, and OPS resources that are available to
operators.  The workshops are scheduled:

August 7-8, 2001
Doubletree Post Oak Hotel
Houston, TX

October 10-11, 2001
Renaissance Greenway Plaza Hotel
Houston, TX

Logistics and an agenda for these meetings will follow in the next few
weeks.  We do know that Day 1 will focus on the rule itself and the
resources available through the National Pipeline Mapping System.   Day 2
will focus on specific portions of the rule and how operators are
approaching those portions.  OPS characterizes this as a ""peer to peer""
exchange and is seeking volunteer company presenters to share ways they are
approaching aspects of the rule.  OPS does not expect a demonstration of
compliance but an exchange of meaningful ways to approach data management,
risk assessment, program development or even subsets of these broad areas.
OPS is seeking operators to make presentations on the Day 2.  If you would
like to take advantage of this opportunity, can contact Beth Callsen at OPS
at (202) 366-4572 or Beth.Callsen@RSPA.dot.gov.

5.	OPS Looking Into Right-of-Way Encroachments

The Office of Pipeline Safety is looking input in a Pipeline Rights-of-Way
Encroachment Research Project.  The response they want will take only a few
minutes of your time.  Submissions must be made no later than June 15.  To
participate in the OPS research effort, complete the questionnaire available
at
http://assn.cycla.com/cycla/trad_SvyHome.trd?&svy=19&pass=encroach&set=oil

6.	New Report on In-Line Inspections

API informs us that the National Association of Corrosion Engineers has
published a new technical committee report, ""In-Line Nondestructive
Inspection of Pipelines.""   The report analyzes currently available and
emerging technologies for in-line inspection tools and reviews their status
with respect to characteristics, performance, range of application, and
limitations.  It is intended as a reference tool.  The report is currently
only available in paper form by contacting NACE at (281) 228-6223 or by fax
at (281)228-639.  The item number is 24211. The price is $22 (list) or $17
(NACE members).  The document will become available in the near future
electronically from the NACE website at www.nace.org, but it is not there
now.

7.	More on ExSTARS

According to an IRS reminder notice received this week, all product terminal
operators must file their initial excise tax reports under the ExSTARS
program by May 31, 2001 covering the month of April 2001.  So if you haven't
done it yet, you're late.  Terminal operators are required to report all
bulk and non-bulk receipts of liquid products into terminals and all
disbursements by position holders using Form 720-TO and monthly inventory
reconciliation by product code using Form 720-CS.  If this is all Greek to
you and you think you are affected, check out the IRS website at
http://www.irs.gov/bus_info/excise/index.html.

8.	Texas Legislature Wraps Up

The Texas legislature finished up business this week.  Few bills passed
affecting pipelines.  However, one bill that did make it out of the
legislature requires pipeline companies to notify the public when they
change the fuels they transport and to share emergency evacuation plans with
school boards.
http://www.austin360.com/statesman/editions/thursday/news_2.html -- Not much
was left on their to-do list.

16.	Not Real-Time Leak Detection

explode-literally.

 ""real-time"" leak detection.  As an alert reader pointed out that this
characterization is not accurate, as the technology described only detects
changes in coating condition. In accomplishing that function, it may be able
to identify the occurrence of outside force damage that results from coating
damage.

17.	Change in Control of the Senate Preserves Staff Jobs for the Time Being

We erred last week in predicting that the switch in party leadership in the
Senate would mean that a large number of former Republican Senate committee
staff would have to look for new work.  The power-sharing arrangement
negotiated in the 50-50 Senate prior to the switch by Sen. Jim Jeffords
(D-VT) provided for continuation of the larger staff budget for the 107th
even if a switch occurs.  So apparently, the staff all get to keep their
jobs.

18.	Index Correction

Pipeline rates may be adjusted upwards by 2.7594% as of July 1, 2001 under
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's new rate index, but the
multiplier is not 1.27594 as we asserted last week.  It is 1.027594, which
is a bit less generous.  Hope you didn't get in trouble on our account.

Per our earlier discussion:

Rawhide - No prohibition on sale of assets.  TGS, CEG, Border (common units), Gaspart, Centragas and Subic/Batangas are primary assets in Rawhide.  EGF is in the process of restructuring deal prior to 12/14 deadline.  Demonstration of some velocity on the sale of these assets would be extremely beneficial in negotiations with banks.

Whitewing - Approval from investors needed if we sell below the Whitewing purchase price (book value).  Asset sales package would need to be prepared and sent to investors in Whitewing (Osprey) who then have 10 days to approve sale. Typically, this has not been a problem, however, circumstances have since changed.  Gordon McKillop manages this process for Enron.

I am familiar with both transactions have the contacts within Global Finance for additional detail if we need it.

"RE: Wind Company","My apologies - I obviously misunderstood the message from last week.  I should have called you to discuss before firing off my memo.  We are doing everything possible to accelerate cash and reduce expenses in the short-term, including financing our Dutch blade facility.  We are working to put in place a bank line for working capital, although that will take a bit of time to arrange.  We are also working to defer vendor payments over the next several weeks.  Our key focus remains getting IMI/Clear Sky closed.  Our deal team is in Columbus, Ohio meeting with AEP this week and our goal is to get a PSA signed with AEP by month end, then complete the project and close the sale and term financing in December!  I met with one of AEP's senior guys in Abilene last week - but for credit concerns over Enron Wind and Enron, he continues to say all the right things about the project purchase.

Quite frankly I am getting tired of memos like this!  There has not been a decision not to provide short-term liquidity for Enron Wind.  If there was I would have called.  Enron is in the midst of a liquidity crisis.  I need the support of the entire team as does Enron to help us get through this.  I need you to see the bigger picture and to think of ways that Wind can help.  I need cost reductions, improved cash flow and SUPPORT.

Subject:	Wind Company

While I understand that the Wind Co is clearly a ""non-core"" asset for Enron,  I am very concerned about the apparent decision in Houston not to provide short-term liquidity for our operations (I have heard that the wind co is on its own for cash  going forward). While I am probably more eager than anyone to have the Wind Co regain its financial independence, I can not do it overnight and am worried about the potentially devasting impact which a lack of short-term capital will have on our business and, quite directly, the value of this asset to Enron.

 As you know, our lenders on IMI/Clear Sky have refused to fund a construction loan (they will not take Enron equity bridge risk) - this construction loan was the most important piece of our working capital/cash funding for Q4.  AEP and its lenders on IMI/Clear Sky are also expressing serious concern about the Enron warranty guaranty (we will likely have to reserve cash to secure our warranty obligations, further exacerbating our cash position).  FPL and AEP have in essence put on hold their deals with Enron Wind pending some clarity on how Enron's liquidity difficulties may affect Enron Wind.  AEP has gone as far as saying the Enron Wind is probably BK without working capital support from Enron, and are understandably asking why should they be comfortable with our performance risk?  Our European vendors, still mindful of Tacke's bankruptcy in 1997, are extremely concerned about our financial condition.  And a number of our counterparties who owe us money but are also owed money by Enron affiliates are seeking to set-off those obligations.  While I will have better numbers over this weekend, without the IMI/Clear Sky construction loan, I will need between $30-35mm through the end of the year (until the AEP sale closes) in order to meet our working capital needs.  Without that support, I can almost guaranty you I will not be able to sell IMI/Clear Sky to AEP and am worried about our short-term financial survival.  

Stan - this clearly has serious implications for the value of Enron Wind and our sales effort.  I am meeting again with my finance team (such as it is) over the weekend and on Monday morning.  I will set up some time with you on Monday or Tuesday to discuss.  I know there is no desire to support the Wind Co medium to long-term, but a decision to cut us off now could be fatal.

"Comments by ENA on proposed reporting requirements RM01-9","Folks --

Attached for you review are draft comments on proposed reporting requirements by ENA.  

In essence, ENA opposes routine filings requirements because the spike in natural gas prices is transitory.  

In addition, ENA complains that the Commission has not addressed the confidentiality issues adequately.  

Lastly, ENA notes the burden of the request, since the information sought is not readily available and does not reflect the way ENA conducts its business. 

These comments will be discussed at today's Regulatory Roundtable meeting at 1:30 central.

"RE: Daily Summary of Risk Data","


Summary Risk Data as of 11/21/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	83	
Active Physical Positions	38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	41.0 	
VaR ($thousands)	166.5 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	0	
		




Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Committees of Associations, CEO's & Presidents of the Associations and
Institutes, and Industry Leaders, confirm the path forward for the entire
industry and collectively we represent the entire industry.  We need to roll
out this confirmation to all the industry stakeholders and encourage the use
of these documents to advance our efforts.  A follow-up face-to-face session
with Secretary Mineta and a few of the CEO's will be worked into  his busy

I understand you are meeting Rory Cullinan of RBS tomorrow.  The attached
note summarises where we have got to on the Wessex sale.

The serious buyers who can deliver quickly are the large financial
institutions.  All are talking about offers in the region of a RAB value of
?1.26 billion.  This is the last published RAB, the current value is ?1.3
billion - RAB grows with approved CAPEX and inflation.

My recommendation is that if we have sorted the Marlin issues, we should
move quickly with RBS and/or WestLB.  They both have the experience, the
resources and the commitment to do a deal quickly.  Both are proposing
structures that should be acceptable to the Regulator and the Wessex Water
Services Board.  We may also want to add Barclays to this list although they
are slower in getting going.

If you need any further information, please give me a call.

I mailed them all out this morning and put a little note for you in yours.  :)  I hope you're having a good day.  I'll talk to you tonight.  I love you!!
Love,
Caron

"Weekly Bullets","Bullets for NNG Marketing:

Midwest
MidAmerican: Pleasant Hill - Preliminary agreements are being drafted concerning an escrow funding arrangement to address concerns of MidAmerican on Northern's credit worthiness with regard to the proposed Pleasant Hill Generation facilities.

Terra Chemicals: After multiple discussions with Terra concerning their ability to activate an offset provision with Northern and other Enron affiliates, payment was received for their November 2001 reservation invoice of $309,000.

Viking Gas Transmission:  NNG officially entered the recent VGT open season by requesting 35,000 MMBtu/day of delivery capacity at Browerville, MN ( a new TBS for VGT) and a receipt point at Chisago (the existing NNG interconnect).  This request is made in an attempt to lower ProjectMax expansion costs.  Our goal is to make this transaction work for $0.02/MMBtu/day.  This would be for the winter only, 15 years, beginning 11/1/2003.

Duluth:  Negotiations with Duluth regarding avoiding a bypass have been slowed by Bud Krause, Manager of Systems Operation.  He is indicating that he now feels that there may not be enough ""value"" in the deal for Duluth.  Bob Stevens is setting up a meeting with NNG management and Duluth. 

Pricing & Storage
Pipeline Capacity.  Analyzed (in conjunction with Facility Planning and Gas Control) potential model changes that provide for incremental 60 mm/d Zone EF capacity and 100 mm/d of Demarc-North capacity that will require minimal facility changes (Sean Bolks has been key in this effort).

FDD.  Review possiblities for purchasing 3rd party storage for potential backstopping of FDD requests that were received during the recent open season.  We received requests for 3-5 Bcf of FDD above our ability to provide service from our own facilities.

Transport Deal.  Finalize Jan - Mar Tenaska transport deal for Field capacity.  Total demand charges of ~$540,000.

Preparing to capitalize on incremental transport and storage deals that may arise due to colder Market Area weather that is anticipated for the next 6 - 10 days.

TI Business.  Continue Field Area TI business analysis in an effort to maximize value from TI shippers.


Project Development
Project MAX / MGO - Contacted Wayne Fransdal this Friday to review the latest information regarding options to serve requirements of the Benson branchline. Identified critical facility scope and cost issues that need to be shared with Wayne to drive the decision process and structure a deal that will be acceptable. Will be working with Facility Planning to complete the information and run through our rate model.
Project MAX / Excel - Received a late request from NSPWis requesting incremental service on the La Crosse branchline. Info forwarded to Facility Planning. Will analyze impact to other shippers that participated in the Open Season on a timely basis and decide how to handle the late request. Hopefully, will be able to accommodate NSPWis w/o any problems.
JAL - Working on a proped sale of facilities to Sid Richardson and a proposal to review w/ management. Goal is to have the package ready by the end of next week or week after. 
CO2 ISSUE - Continue to work w/ Facility Planning to develop the best alternatives utilizing the treating facilities at Lyons. Goal is to have the project fully scoped by the end of the year.

Stan;
I got your letter and company info, thanks. By the way, our President, Scott
Brown, is going to be in Dallas on the 16th and 17th of May making a
presentation to Worldcom. I thought I would check with you to see if any of
your people with Enron Broadband might be able to meet briefly with Scott on
the 15th (Tuesday) or 18th (Friday, which would be better) in Houston to
discuss our services. If they can meet just let me know dates and times and
I'll coordinate with Scott.

I still plan to be in Dallas to see Hugh King sometime in mid to late June,
and I will plan to stop down in Houston while I'm there and we can try to
get together. Thanks,

Terry

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

As we approach the Thanksgiving Holiday, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.  
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives as well as those who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. 
I recognize that here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and that everyone in the organization is working hard.  Thank you for your continued dedication.
Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends.   
Happy Thanksgiving.

"Business Review","After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE business review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand better.  The first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial exposures to changing prices.  The second is the rate case.  I would be happy to return to Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast of players.  I am open to suggestions from you.

Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.

"Weekly report","Stan - Operations have been normal this week. NBP's unit price recovered to above $38. Prices in the midwest have continued to be low vs. Alberta, so we have been running at around 90% load factor (200-300/d empty space). Hopefully the current cold weather will hang on until next week when the industries come back up after the new year.

 I have not seen Crestone/Bearpaw volumes this week. We should get an update after the holidays. No reports of any problems. 

One very sad note. Larry Weisman (52) of the Petersburg Team on MGT died as a result of a heart attack on Christmas eve. I will send along details as I get them. We have sent flowers from here. I believe the funeral will be Friday. We will have Company representation at the funeral, but I do not plan to go.

I will be in the office this week, but on vacation Monday 12/31. I will give you a call next Wednesday with next week's update. On Friday 1/4, I will be in late due to the big party after the Husker Rose Bowl victory.

Please give me a call if there is any big new news regarding Enron this week.

Summary Risk Data as of 11/20/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	      83	
Active Physical Positions	      38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	   (146.1)	
VaR ($thousands)	    166.5 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	       0	
		




Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Did Keith also have discussions with Jim Saunders about picking up workload?  What will Brannon, Kadakia, Menefee and Walker be doing for EGA?

None of these seven individuals were on the retain/transfer list that Stan reviewed yesterday.  Rod, if you support this, I suggest that you and Keith review this with Stan to get his approval.

Blake Walker


In addition, the following would support the transition through the period stated below:

Joe Grajewski -  	12/31/01	- Transition issues to Sommers
William Gehle -   	 1/31/01		- Currently negotiating CIGSA settlement
Amanda Camacho-	 1/31/01		- Transition A/P to Corp outsourcing group

Discussions with Jeff indicate that he does not have the excess capacity to absorb the remaining issues confronting EEOS accounting.

Profile: Power Play, Who's to Blame for the Energy Crisis?; Lowell Bergman, ""Frontline"" correspondent, Laura Holson and Joseph Kahn, The New York Times, discuss the energy crisis

06/04/2001

ABC News: Nightline

(c) Copyright 2001, American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Announcer: June 4th, 2001. CHRIS BURY host: 

Rolling power blackouts, bankrupt utilities, skyrocketing electricity prices.

Unidentified Man #1: It is the most volatile commodity in the world. 

BURY: Are power generators gouging consumers? 

Unidentified Woman #1: I think it's pretty appalling that the folks who sell us power can charge whatever they want. 

Mr. KENNETH L. LAY (Chairman, Enron): And every time there's a shortage or a little bit of a price spike, it is always collusion or conspiracy or something. I mean, it always makes people feel better that way. 

BURY: And right in the middle, a federal agency you've probably never heard of. 

Mr. CURTIS HEBERT (Chairman, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission): They didn't build this monopolistic system overnight, and we won't change it overnight either. 

BURY: Tonight, Power Play, Who's to Blame for the Energy Crisis? 

Announcer: From ABC News, this is NIGHTLINE. Substituting for Ted Koppel and reporting from Washington, Chris Bury. 

BURY: California is known as the great American incubator. From hem lines to Hula-Hoops, the Golden State gives birth to trends that often spread east. That is why so many states are paying close attention to California's troubled attempt at deregulating electricity. Last week, California Governor Gray Davis asked President Bush for help in the form of a price cap on power companies. The president said no. Now Governor Davis is threatening to sue the federal agency that regulates electricity prices. More on that later. 

But first, the results of a new ABC News/Washington Post poll. It suggests that President Bush is developing an energy problem. When asked what they think of the president's performance on energy, a clear majority, 58 percent, say they disapprove. That's up 15 percent since Mr. Bush released his energy plan. When asked if they think the United States is heading into an energy crisis, six in 10 Americans answer yes. 

TEXT: 

ABC News POLL The Washington Post 

Margin of Error +-3.0% 

How do you rate the president's performance on energy? 

June 3 May 13 

Disapprove 58% 43% 

Do you think the US is heading into an energy crisis? 

Yes 61% No 36% 

BURY: California is already there. For months now, The New York Times and the public broadcasting program ""Frontline"" have teamed up to investigate. Their collaboration, ""Blackout,"" airs tomorrow night on many PBS stations. It documents a colossal mismatch in the brand new game of buying and selling power on the open market. It's like the New York Yankees against the Toledo Mud Hens. 

Unidentified Woman #2: We didn't use his five because their minimum was, you know, higher than what we were willing to pay. 

Unidentified Man #2: I'll sell you 108 now. 

BURY: (VO) On one side, companies such as Enron, the Texas energy broker, trade electricity like any other commodity. A sophisticated trading operation buys and sells billions of dollars worth of energy every day. It's the largest company of its kind in the world. 

Unidentified Man #3: See what I'm saying? 

KELLY: CRS. This is Kelly. 

BURY: (VO) On the other side, in this converted department store in Sacramento, is California's trading team. 

Unidentified Man #4: This is the operations center. This is the--this is the location where we make energy purchases and fill the state of California energy requirements. 

BURY: (VO) Here, employees drafted from the state's water department go head-to-head with the pros from Enron and other companies. Since 1999, the cost to California has skyrocketed from $7 billion to an estimated $60 billion this year, an increase of 750 percent. And the demand for electricity, up less than 5 percent. 

(OC) In their documentary, reporters for The New York Times and ""Frontline"" address a fundamental question, who's to blame? Narrating this segment is ""Frontline"" correspondent Lowell Bergman. 

Unidentified Man #5: Our forecast reserves look like they'd be pretty thin over the peak as well. 

Unidentified Man #6: How much is... 

LOWELL BERGMAN reporting: 

(VO) The power industry blames the high prices on shortages brought on by California's failure to build any major power plants over the last decade, despite a booming economy. 

Mr. LAY: I mean, we have a supply/demand imbalance. Too much demand, too little supply in California. 

BERGMAN: (VO) Not everyone agrees. Consumer advocates in California accuse the generators of actually withholding supply. 

Ms. NETTIE HOGE (Executive Director, TURN): The idea that all of a sudden we had a supply crunch is preposterous. What happened is, all of a sudden, the new plant owners and the traders, like Mr. Lay's organization, looked at the data and figured out how to manipulate the market. As soon as that happened, the prices never went down again. If it was totally a supply problem, why would we have excess prices at 5:00 in the morning on Christmas Day when nobody but Santa is working? 

BERGMAN: (VO) The generators, in turn, say they shut down plants for routine winter maintenance. 

Mr. LAY: Every time there's a shortage or a little bit of a price spike, it's always collusion or conspiracy or something. I mean, it always makes people feel better that way. 

BERGMAN: But you know as well as I do that the price--it's nice for a business. 

Mr. LAY: Yeah. 

BERGMAN: You're in the business of--of making money for your shareholders. 

Mr. LAY: Mm-hmm. 

BERGMAN: Right, as a company? 

Mr. LAY: Yeah. 

BERGMAN: So you would be foolish, as you said, to turn down the kind of money you could make this past winter in California. Is--isn't there a... 

Mr. LAY: I--I--I think you put words in my mouth out there. 

BERGMAN: OK. 

Mr. LAY: I said we--we made some money in California. We made some money across the country and around the world. I mean, and as I tell my friends in California, Enron was doing quite well before California imploded. 

Unidentified Man #7: So you can't blame the Enrons. I mean, they're the guys--that's--that's what they do. They try to make as much money from the money that they get invested. You blame the regulators. 

BERGMAN: (VO) Across the country, tucked in an out of the way building behind Union Station in Washington, DC, sits the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC. FERC's commissioners are appointed by the president and control a $250 billion energy sector critical to America's economy. With the coming of deregulation, state control over wholesale electricity rates passed to the federal government, making FERC the final arbiter of just and reasonable rates. It's a power FERC has been reluctant to use. 

Curt Hebert is a protege of Senator Trent Lott, who convinced President Clinton to appoint Hebert to the FERC in 1997. In January, President Bush made him the FERC chairman, and Hebert has made no bones about where he stands on free markets. 

Mr. HEBERT: The rules of competition govern that economies work, that choice works. It's why we're American. We inherently like choice. It's why we left the mother country. We didn't like the rules they were setting. We wanted to make our own rules. We want our own choices and we believe that works. 

BERGMAN: OK, but is electricity different? 

Mr. HEBERT: It's a transition . It takes some time. Look, they didn't build this monopolistic system overnight, and we won't change it overnight either. 

Mr. WILLIAM MASSEY (FERC Commissioner): Without some effective price control this summer, I fear for the worst. 

BERGMAN: (VO) William Massey is a FERC commissioner, a Democrat, who has found himself in opposition to his chairman. 

Unidentified Man #8: Mr. Massey, what is the nub of the disagreement that you have with Mr. Hebert? 

Mr. MASSEY: I think what it boils down to is a philosophical disagreement about the role of my agency in ensuring just and reasonable prices. 

I think it's long past time for this agency to step in and--and impose a temporary time out on the markets. 

Mr. HEBERT: Well, that is the problem because these people are saying temporary, but they don't mean temporary. It's kind of like the temporary rent control you have in New York. It's not temporary at all. Matter of fact, you know, in Washington, DC, we don't do temporary very well, and that's a problem. 

BERGMAN: (VO) In fact, late last year, after six months of unrelenting high prices in California, the FERC finally did declare California's rates unjust and unreasonable, but took no action. 

Governor GRAY DAVIS (Governor, California): So they found these people guilty a year ago. They just haven't agreed on the sentence. 

BERGMAN: Well, we talked with Curt Hebert. And we got... 

Gov. DAVIS: Well that's, you know. 

BERGMAN: That's what? 

Gov. DAVIS: Lots of luck. 

BERGMAN: What do you mean, ""Lot's of luck""? 

Gov. DAVIS: Because... 

BERGMAN: He's the federal--he's the guy you are turning to to give you the money. 

Gov. DAVIS: He is the chairman of the commission. But he has not been overly sympathetic to California. He's more of an ideologue than a problem solver. 

BERGMAN: Well, he's saying you just want him to give you short-term relief, price caps, which won't solve the problem. 

Gov. DAVIS: Problems meaning fattening the balance sheet of already enormously wealthy energy companies. 

BURY: How much blame do the energy companies really deserve? 

BERGMAN: Watch your--your heating bills, your natural gas bills, which are, to a certain extent, reflected in your electricity bill. And don't think that this couldn't happen where you are. 

BURY: And how much of this energy crisis did California bring upon itself? Those questions when we come back. 

Announcer: This is ABC News: NIGHTLINE, brought to you by... 

(Commercial break) 

BURY: Joining us from Boston, Lowell Bergman, the correspondent for tomorrow's ""Frontline"" broadcast. From our Los Angeles bureau, Laura Holson, a business correspondent for The New York Times, who's been covering the California energy crisis. And here in Washington, Joe Kahn, who reports on energy and economics for The New York Times. 

Laura, just before the break, we heard California Governor Davis blaming the energy companies and the federal regulators. How much of his argument is sinking in. In other words, whom do Californians blame for this? 

Ms. LAURA HOLSON (The New York Times): The interesting thing is Californians blame everybody for this ap--for what has happened with the energy crisis. They blame the governor for not responding quickly enough to a crisis that started, you know, a year ago, if you really, you know, look at when prices starting going up. They are angry at their utilities who they feel have failed them. They have often had very close kind of paternal relationships with their utilities and they feel that they've been cheated. And they are very angry with the power generators, in particular, who they feel are charging them just exorbitant amounts for energy. 

In particular, there was a company last week, a power generator that said it charged consumers, rather the utilities, 4,000, nearly $4,000 per megawatt hour, which is enough to light a thousand homes for one hour. And when they heard this, they were outraged. They just thought, you know, `How can this be? How can we get,' in their terms, kind of ripped off by power generators who are using them to make, you know, a lot of money. 

BURY: Joe Kahn we heard those poll numbers from this survey out tonight suggesting that President Bush has a bit of a public relations problem on energy. How is that going to affect the politics here in Washington? 

Mr. JOSEPH KAHN (The New York Times): Well, clearly the--President Bush and the White House are calculating that by the time people have to go to the polls to select a new president, a slew of new power plants will be online in California. Electricity prices, presumably, will come down quite a bit and their free market stance on this will not ultimately cost him at the polls. It's not as clear that Republicans in the Congress have the same commitment. This has already been a very turbulent time in Washington with the Democrats now in control of the Senate. I think you can expect to see a legislative initiative by the Democrats to introduce some kind of price caps in California. Some Republicans may sign on to that. Some have already indicated that they will. It's going to be a real knockdown political flight--fight in Washington over what the strategy ought to be. 

BURY: Lowell Bergman, talk a little bit about that free market activity that Joe just mentioned. We saw the clip from your documentary with the--the traders from Enron pitted against the--the buyers from California. And I must say, it really did look like a mismatch. 

BERGMAN: Well, in fact, some of the people at Enron told us that they welcome the day when PG&E and Southern California Edison, the regular utilities get back in the marketplace because they do feel like they've got them, if you will, outgunned. And--but I should point out to the audience, that when Laura was talking about this $3800 a megawatt hour, which was Duke Energy Company, the normal price, if you will, the standard price for a megawatt hour was around 40 or less. So the level of profit that we're talking about is what people are upset about. And the problem here is--is primarily that in a free market and the way that the marketplace in California is set up in particular, there's no limit to what could be--could be charged when you get close to that area of scarcity with electricity. Electricity truly is different and as Jeff Skillings says in our documentary, he's the CEO of Enron, it is the most volatile commodity in the world. 

BURY: Yet, at the same time, Joe, we are seeing electricity traded as if it were oil or soybeans or steel. I mean, how is electricity different? 

Mr. KAHN: Well, for economic reasons, it's different in a--in a couple of key respects. For one thing, it's an absolutely vital commodity. People aren't prepared to do without it. Moreover, electricity powers every other part of the economy. So, it's one of these sort of fundamental rights that we have. In fact, as far back as the New Deal, Franklin Roosevelt made clear that electricity was so important that it would be subject to federal legislation guaranteeing everybody in this country just and reasonable electricity prices. 

BURY: But just and reasonable electricity prices, Laura, do you want to pick up the question of well, who determines what's just and reasonable here? 

Ms. HOLSON: Well, it's very clear that President Bush believes that the market, you know, sets what's just and reasonable. And, you know, that has not been what Governor Davis has said at all. He believes that because this is a commodity that people, you know, believe is guaranteed that there should be some price cap on it. It's an interesting, if you will, situation when business and politics kind of intersect. Governor Davis said very early on that he did not want two things to happen in California. One is that the utilities would go bankrupt and the second was that rates would be raised for consumers. And he's in a very tight spot right now because those two things that he did not want to happen indeed have happened. And it only looks like it will get worse this summer when experts have said Californians can expect another 260 hours of blackouts. 

BURY: Laura, we have to take a break. But when we come back, we want to address the question of whether power companies are doing what just comes naturally to them. Back with our guests in a moment. 

(Commercial break) 

BURY: We're back with ""Frontline""'s Lowell Bergman and Laura Holson and Joe Kahn of The New York Times. 

Joe, aren't these power companies doing exactly what they are supposed to be doing, which is maxi--maximizing profits and to get the biggest return for their shareholders? 

Mr. KAHN: Sure. That's their responsibility. They--they have no excuse for arbitrarily lowering the price that they could charge for electricity if the market will bear a higher price. 

BURY: Lowell Bergman, in your documentary, do you find any evidence that the power companies are--are gouging consumers or doing anything illegal? 

BERGMAN: Well, illegality, no one really has any serious evidence, although there have been lots of allegations and there's been lots of speculation about it. But we should also point out in the documentary and in The Times that some of the companies are starting to realize, it seems, that even though they are owed hundreds of millions, in some cases $500 million or more still by these bankrupt utilities, they're going to have to take a hair cut as Governor Davis describes it. They're going to have to make some bargain. And I think we may... 

BURY: Let me jump in there. What do you mean they're going to have to get a hair cut? 

BERGMAN: Well, apparently, that's Governor Davis's way of telling them that they're going to have to take less to a--less than a full dollar payment for what they are owed, and that there has to be some kind of settlement here of between the various parties, other we're not--otherwise we won't see any progress. 

BURY: Lowell, one of the old cliches in investigative reporting is follow the money. And much has been made of this argument that the Bush administration, accusations have been made, that the Bush administration is too cozy with the power companies and the power company regulators. What did you find in your reporting? 

BERGMAN: Well, we found that Vice President Cheney was very up front about it, I mean, about his relationship with Ken Lay, the head of Enron, the fact that he built a stadium for Enron when he was head of Halliburton. You know, the vice president is the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to hold presidential office in the history of the United States. So--but they are very open and up front and balance this relationship with their friends and with the people who they feel comfortable with. 

BURY: Laura Holson, this idea that so many Texas companies are profiting from California's misery, as it were, I suppose Californians find that particularly infuriating. 

Ms. HOLSON: It's funny, in the San Francisco Bay area when I was growing up near there, there was this great rivalry between the San Francisco 49ers, which is, as we all know, a football team and the Dallas Cowboys. And that seems to be replaced, if you will, with consumers in California who look at Texas gen--at, you know, a lot of the power generators, which are based in Texas, and who they feel now are just, you know, making a lot of money off them. It's--there's always been a rivalry between those two states. And now I think it's deeply personal because it's hitting consumers, or as they believe it, it's hitting them in their pocket books. 

BURY: Joe Kahn, how long before these new power plants are going to be coming on line? And before they do, or in the time before they do, what--what is it that the federal government can do to help California out? 

Mr. KAHN: Well, it--it will probably be about 18 months before sufficient new power comes online in California to start substantially changing the supply and demand equation there. And that's a very speedy pace. That's with a very expedited permit process for new plants. The governor in California has put a lot of effort into building new plats--plants quickly. 

BURY: So what happens between now and then? 

Mr. KAHN: Well, that's the question. That's the debate. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the power under the Federal Power Act, in fact some people argue it has the obligation under the Federal Power Act to ensure that just and reasonable electricity rates prevail in California at all times. It can't just selectively choose the times. And it has already found at the end of last year that rates in California are unjust and unreasonable. 

BURY: So what's it doing about that? 

Mr. KAHN: Well, it's--it's tried a variety of compromise measures so far, very limited price controls on certain kinds of electricity sales during emergency hours. So far that appears to be an insignificant contribution to reducing the overall electricity bill in California. 

BURY: Laura, Governor Davis is demanding wholesale price controls. President Bush has made it pretty clear that he's not going to lean that way. What options does Governor Davis have? 

Ms. HOLSON: You know, it's--again he's stuck in this place where it--it doesn't look like he's got any kind of real out. I mean, he can try to demand. He can demand as much as he wants from the power generators, but if the federal government doesn't step in, he really can't do anything. The interesting thing, at least I see kind of going forward, is how Californians have really adapted to a really, you know, awful situation. There's a law that's being proposed right now in California in which businesses will know months in advance whether their neighborhood is going to be impacted by a blackout so they can plan. I mean, we've almost turned into--if anybody remembers traveling through Italy during their college days, you always kind of knew when the airlines or the trains were going to go on strike because they told you a day ahead of time. And that's very much what's happening in California where they're warning people, you know, two days, an hour, you know, one day ahead of time so that they can prepare. 

BURY: That's a pretty dark scenario. Lowell, we just have a few seconds left, what lessons should the rest of the country take from California's crisis? 

BERGMAN: Well, watch your--your heating bills, your natural gas bills, which are to a certain extent reflected in your electricity bills. And don't think that this couldn't happen where you are. And I think that the industry itself is beginning to understand that the crisis in California may, in fact, impact on the future of deregulation nationally. 

BURY: Lowell Bergman, Laura Holson, Joe Kahn, thank you so much for joining us tonight. 

BERGMAN: Thank you. 

Mr. KAHN: Thank you. 

Ms. HOLSON: Thank you. 

BURY: When we come back, an update on a NIGHTLINE broadcast from just over a month ago. 

Announcer: To receive a daily e-mail about each evening's NIGHTLINE and a preview of special broadcasts, logon to the NIGHTLINE page at abcNEWS.com. 

(Commercial break) 

BURY: In May, we profiled the case of death row inmate Johnny Paul Penry, convicted of murdering the sister of a former pro football player. Today, the Supreme Court overturned Penry's death sentence. It ruled, six to three, that the jury did not have clear instructions on how to weigh his mental retardation when it sentenced him. The court will take up the broader issue, whether executing the mentally retarded is cruel and unusual punishment, in its next term. 

That's our report for tonight. I'm Chris Bury in Washington. For all of us here at ABC News, good night.

"2nd quarter PGG EBIT","The following is an update on PGG earnings for the 2nd quarter and our ability
increase our EBIT for PGG from our last current estimate of 58 million to at
least 62 million.  I talked with Kirk Steven's this afternoon and after
looking at our preliminary closing estimates for power cost for May, our June
current estimate of power cost, and the amount of overview (25 million) we had
targeted for the second quarter here is what we concluded based upon the
assumption that prices for June do not continue to degrade from current levels
like they have over the last month.

Current Estimate Provided to Enron for Q2                   58  million
Power Cost & O&M Improvement > Overview               10  million
Catchup on Enron Allocations                                     (  3) million
Total EBIT                                                                    
65  million

There are two sensitivities to this estimate that could lower this number by a
combined 6.5 million.  

First we understand that we may be allocated charges for the Tomas transaction
that ran through the PGG books last year.  We reserved 1.8 million last year
and we understand the total charges from GATX could be as much as $5.1
million.  We did not include anything in our targets or plan for additional
charges since this transaction was originated in Houston.  

Second we have incurred $3.2 million in costs associated with supply chain
software associated with the sale of PGE to Sierra.  We will have to write-off
these costs in the second quarter since the software would only have value in
a peoplesoft system environment.  We have had good discussions with Bob Butz
about Enron covering these costs with some of the money they received from
Sierra to terminate the transaction.  We will need to resolve this in the 2nd
quarter or take the write-off which would reduce our EBIT.

In addition, as we have communicated before with you, we still have an open
long power position in June and all of the third quarter for reliability
purposes which will continue to cause our earnings to be volatile.  Recently
power curves in the west have been trading down but we would expect them to
rise as the warm weather comes on and loads in California increase.  There
have been some structural changes in the California market that could tend to
dampen the price curves for this summer.  

We will continue to keep you informed on what changes we are seeing as we go
through June in terms of meeting the 2nd Quarter adjusted current estimate
EBIT numbers discussed above.  If you have any questions or would like to
discuss this further feel free to call me at 503-464-8982.

"Weekly Report for November 16","
Power Supply
All plants are running smoothly with exception of Colstrip #4  - Colstrip 4 has a boiler tube leak that was discovered  yesterday.  The steam leak is impinging on other tubes and will create  further damage if not scheduled off-line soon.  Unit has been scheduled for  36-hour outage starting a ramp down today at 2200 hours MST and will off-line at  midnight.
 
Once the market settled down the prices have been steadily  sliding in both gas and electric.  We have been trading around our assets -  playing the spark spread.
 
We are actively pursuing parking and lending agreements with  Reliant and El Paso, discussing terms for a purchase of firm power or tolling  from Engage, and evaluating purchase of non-firm power from  Enserco.
 
Finance
PGE was downgraded by Fitch this week to BBB+ from A on  secured debt and BBB from A- on unsecured debt.  Fitch""s actions move them  out of step with Moody's and Standard & Poors.  The downgrade will cost  PGE 20 to 40 basis points on our short term borrowing lines.  Fitch's  actions are directly related to Enron's downgrade and the acquisition of PGE by  NW Natural.  We are watching the other two rating agencies to see if they  take similar actions.
 
PGE is still locked out of the long term debt market as a  result of Enron's situation and we are currently being advised that we will not  be able to enter the capital markets for long term debt until next year at the  soonest.
 
Human Resources
We have been holding small group employees meetings with  officers all week to get information out to our employees about the Enron /  Dynegy transaction and to discuss the status of their 401K plan.  The  employee response has been one of anger and disgust as many of them have lost  significant value in their 401K as a result of being heavily invested in Enron  stock.
 
Regulatory Affairs
We expect to receive an order on UE-115 (general rate case)  reconsideration request next week.
 
PGE, Sierra Pacific, Nevada Power, Avista, and Montana Power  jointly filed with FERC the TransConnect rate filing which requests  performance based rates for a for-profit Transco into which PGE and other  western utilities could contribute their transmission assets.  The  rates are pro forma in nature and no action on transferring any assets  to TransConnect will be taken until we evaluate the business case that results  from FERC's decision and guidance on our pro forma rates.
 
PGE / NW Natural Transaction
We continue to work with NWN on the OPUC filing which was to  be filed today but has been delayed until early next week.  The most  significant issue is the rate plan and what share of the savings from the  transaction will be given to customers and what is the form of that  refund.  We are also working on the FERC and SEC applications which will be  filed in the future.
 
Integration Planning has started with the Integration Team  focusing on an overall project plan for the effort.

"FW: Draft MOU regarding equity sale","Wade/Rob/Bruce:

I think we should reconfigure the MOU to constitute a binding obligation to purchase and sell rather than a MOU that would lead to a definitive agreement.  We are trying to force an answer, it seems to me at this stage of the game, a definitive offer should be put forward for acceptance or rejection.

Thoughts?

"Future Business Opportunities with Illinois Power","Stan and Bill,

I just wanted to briefly call to your attention that the merger between Dynegy and Enron could bring about greater business opportunities between Northern Border Pipeline and Illinois Power.  Illinois Power serves 650,000 natural gas and electricity customers in a 15,000 square-mile territory across Illinois.  

Illinois Power currently holds a 40 MMbtu/d contract on MGT that will expire in December of 2002.  This contract serves a power plant off their system near Urbana, IL.  We hope to continue and expand this relationship with MGT. 

Northern Border does not connect with Illinois Power but is within 10 - 15 miles of a portion of their system in north-central Illinois.  We have begun discussions with Illinois Power about developing a project to access this market.

"RE: UBS Customer References","Adam,

Our original agreement with UBS (Nevin & Goran) was that selected customer references would be permitted shortly before signing.  We would not want to allow this so early in the process when there is still some 6 weeks to signing and the Banks have not obtained final credit approval.  I have spoken to Nevin and reminded him of this understanding and he agrees that introducing uncertainty in the market this far ahead of signing is not beneficial for either the buyer or the seller.  He will speak to Jason Perkins and explain.

Attached is a short list of recommended U.S. customer references.  These four customers account for the bulk of our 2001 order book and we think provide a good cross-section of people for UBS to speak with.  I will wait to hear back from you before releasing this list to UBS.  Also, there are a number of other customers who, if I were UBS, I would want to speak with, including investors in our 750 projects (other than FPL) who as a group are not all that happy, and some of the other US developers.  We should anticipate requests to speak with those entities as well.  Adam

"Indian Mesa Sale - Creditor's Committee","Good news - The creditors' committee is okay with the sale of the project on current price and terms.

Bad news -  The creditors' committee wants all of the net cash to go to the estate (I had proposed that we keep enough of the net cash at EW in order to fund our expected WC needs through sale of the company).  We are now negotiating for a freeze on the net cash (through Jan 7) pending a presentation by Enron and CSFB (next week) as to why it is in the estate's best interest to allow EW to operate as a going concern in order to maximize value to the estate on sale of the business.  Mark is on board for this presentation.

Bottom line - if we do not have access to a significant portion of the net cash from this sale, I will not be able to keep the business going through a Q1 sale.  Bad result for all involved.  

I will give you a further update when we talk this afternoon.

"Dabhol status - USG","
	USG has now met after the PM Visit and its strategy is for OPIC to go to Delhi the week after next (Dec 4-5) and meet with GOI to underscore the fact that a private equity sale will not take care of the project and that the GOI has only several weeks to address and dispose of the issue before the Dabhol problem becomes the subject of formal bilateral negotiations in which OPIC moves across the table.  Accordingly OPIC is expecting that out of next week's meetings will come a decision to file a claim, which they will not contest.
	I am meeting with OPIC management fri AM to discuss specific message so any additional points I would appreciate before then.

	Also, FYI,   OPIC is going to India from Turkey where they are negotiating a resolution to the foreign exchange issue on Trakya.  OPIC senior management is spending the bulk of its time on Enron issues, including Electrobolt and Cuiaba.

Subject:	Retirement


May 7, 2001


Stan Horton
Chairman and Chief Exective Officer

Dear Mr. Horton:

Thank you for your letter of congratulation on my recent retirement.

I would like to make a suggestion, for the retirement plan for others.

        When the 27 page retirement letter is sent, that a time table of
when items will be in place or transferred         be included. (3-9
months or when)

        Medical Forms can't be put in now until after you leave.  I went
back to the office to HR and they put         the information in the
system.  Two weeks after I left I called to see when I would receive the
card (Dr.         offices like to see the card).  I was tolled I wasn't
even in the system.  So I called back to Omaha HR         and they worked
to get it in place.  When I went to get a RX  I was not in that system
either and had to         come home and call HR and start over with that
system.

        The only part of the funds that are transferred as of this date
is the Cash Balance Plan.  The Savings         Plan and ESOP are not
transferred to my Financial Plan.  They tell me they will be; this is why
I feel           a timeline would be helpful.  Until I received my
Medical Card I put off going to the Dr.  Also I haven't         wanted to
take a trip because, I am unsure of when funds will be transferred.

         Last week I received a letter from a transfer Company out of NY.
with (2) shares of  ENRON                 stock.  So I called NY to see
what Fund that was from,  they didn't know they were just to set up a
    account.  I called the Enron retirement line and they didn't know
what Fund that was from either.

        Many of the people who answers the phones about any of this just
don't have answers.

ENRON employees have been well taken care of while we are working, this
doesn't seem like that in retirement.  I share this because I know your
are always working to improve ENRON.

Sincerely,

Jean Mohring

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Cindy,
Will you please add my new Administrative Assistant to your future ""cc"" lists?  She is Sarita Garza.  Thanks so much.  John

P.S.  I have asked Sarita and Amelia to get with you and see when a favorable date would be that Phil Lowry and I could have about 30 minutes with Stan to go over the ""Operations Alliances"" with him (since his half day staff meeting was cancelled for May 16).  Anyway, this is just a heads-up that they will be in touch to get a date confirmed.  Thank you.  JHS

"Eco Update","Stan/Jim,
 
Following, please find Eco's latest update.  
 
Lenders:  a call took place this a.m. with the entire syndicate of lenders (27 in total I believe).  Lenders will proceed to either remove conditions to their credit approvals and/or move forward with presentations to the credit committee - completion time is 1 to 2 weeks; lenders reiterated their ok with a Dec 14 satisfaction of all Cp's to the closing on the SPA with Mirant.  Lender's Agent (ABN Amro) committed to getting the lenders a copy of the ""as it stands"" lender consent agreement and also committed everyone to issuing a finalized lender consent document by this Friday.  This puts pressure on Mirant to deliver on final comments, following a series of lender counsel correspondence on the agreement (sent last week).  
 
GE: a call took place this p.m. with GE to review status.  We made it clear to Mirant that progress on this front was slow and that we were concerned with their slow document turn around time.  Mirant committed to deliver comments on: the Guarantee, the Members Agreement, the Tax Agreement and also committed to delivering their version of the Share Purchase Agreement with GE, all by Thursday noon time.  The other document pending: the revised bylaws of the new entity where GE's preferred shares will be held, will be prepared by Cayman counsel; work had been held up on Mirant's non-agreement to cover legal fees; that too was resolved today and counsel should have been commissioned.  
 
Other:  Mirant has agreed to have a detailed conference call tomorrow at 5pm to review the ""Closing Checklist"".  This is very important in that up until now they have been reluctant to discuss any type of work plan and this, at least, gets us all comfortable that they understand the work ahead of us.  Additionally, we sent to Mirant (tonight) a revised side letter providing for the target date of Dec 14th for completion of all CP's, for a (no earlier than) Dec 19th (this is their request) and the elimination of the three business day float between closing of CP's and funding.  In this letter Mirant would commit to dedication of all resources, to diligently pursuing closing of CP's by 12/14 and to a work plan/checklist.  
 
Insurance: (NOT A CP TO CLOSING) final report from third party adjuster has been sent to underwriter's office, care of in-house adjuster.  Unfortunately, the in-house adjuster is out on jury duty for two weeks.  I have a call into Jim B. to see what can be done to expedite the review and approval process.  Worst case here is that, if we insist on handling the claims post closing and Mirant agrees, we will have to guarantee a recovery amount to Mirant.  With the third party adjuster/CPA having signed off on the $26.1 million recovery amount, risk should be greatly mitigated.
 
Will report on tomorrow's progress at end of business day.

Thanks, Mariella

"GISB Pre-Board Conference Call","Stan,

Below are the items that will be discussed under the 'GISB Issues Update' agenda item.  Please note that the pipeline segment Executive Committee representatives are bringing these items to your attention to raise your level of awareness.  We welcome your comments and suggestions.  We understand that the best course of action may be no action.

Lack of ratification results.  The 'Final Actions' page of the GISB Web site has not been updated since January, 2000.  Three ratifications have taken place since that time; two more are occuring this month.  Most importantly, this information is needed for internal planning purposes for computer system changes.  GISB subcommittees also need this information in order to operate effectively.  ENA has been attempting to obtain the results of the April 9 ratification since mid-April.  They're unable to obtain verbal results, much less something in writing or posted.  ENA is considering sending a letter to GISB requesting that the GISB Web site be kept up-to-date.  If so, they'll be looking for other parties to co-sign.

Request logs are not kept current.  GISB's logs, which show the status of requests, have not been updated since May 10, 1999 (per the logs that were last posted).  These logs appear on two Web pages - for standards requests and for interpretation requests.  The log that is currently posted for interpretations requests is dated May 10, 1999.  For standards requests, the logs were removed from the Web site at least six months ago.  At that time, they were current as of May 10, 1999.

Lack of participation.  This was mentioned during the December, 2000 Board meeting.  The EC reps simply want you to be aware of this fact.  The Technical Subcommittee usually has two attendees - including the chair.  The attendance at the Information Requirements Subcommittee (IR) meetings has slightly improved over the last couple of months.  As a reminder - since Jim Keisler passed away, IR is looking for a second co-chair.  I've been approached but have not yet given a response.  Shelley, Brad and I are addressing this.

The May 24 BPS meeting.  You've received at least two e-mails on this topic.  The EC reps will answer any questions the Board members may have and again welcome your comments.

Thanks,
Theresa

"FW: 2nd quarter PGG EBIT","Is there any chance that Stan (PGE) may be allocated any charges this quarter for the Tomas transaction that ran through the PGG books last year.   It would seem like if we were trying to make the transmission and distribution business numbers look good this quarter we would want to avoid making that charge.   Plus it doesn't sound to me like it was a PGE deal.

Second, I understand a discussion has taken place about offsetting the $3.2 million in costs associated with supply chain software associated with the sale of PGE to Sierra from the funds received from the termination.   What is the likelihood that we will get some relief for that item? 

As you can see I am trying to get some certainty to some loose ends.

"RE: GTB Payment status","Hopefully, when everything is done, it'll be considered quite a bit better than reasonable.  In addition to the $2.0MM cash we should receive next week, the following are included in the deal:

- at least another $1.5MM cash during January
- no further EPCSC expenditures, except for my staff; i.e., GTB assumes all outstanding purchase commitments
- follow-on profitable work consulting for the replacement contractor and/or GTB (scope & rates still to be negotiated)
- a project profit of close to $4MM, about as much as we would have made if the contract were completed, but with no further project risk

I obviously didn't include these items in the report due to the wide distribution.

Have a great holiday.

"RE: Indy 500 Invitation","Unfortunately I am not going to be able to accept your generous offer to attend the Indy 500.  My wife and I have 1 year-old twins and I was hoping to get our Nanny to pull some week-end duty to help my wife with them as I went to the races.  Unfortunately I was not successful in doing that.  Leaving her to look after two infants while I attend the races didn't seem right.  Thanks for the invitation!

The terminated contracts with RMTC are now fixed receivables as of the early termination date of December 14, 2001 except for interest. NNG is owed $4.8mm and TW is owed $33.9mm.  Amounts are past due.

Definitions:
Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport and storage agreements or unhedged natural positions.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.

"Per discussion - article on Rebecca Mark","FREE AND CLEAR OF ENRON'S WOES
Edited by Sheridan Prasso 
By Stephanie Anderson Forest

11/26/2001 
BusinessWeek 
Page 16 
(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.) 
Back in Enron's heyday, one of its rising stars was Rebecca Mark. Nicknamed ``Mark the Shark'' because of her ferocious ambition, she made her name in the early '90s building the energy giant's international operations, including the now-troubled Dabhol power plant in India. Once rumored to be a successor to Enron CEO Ken Lay, she resigned from Enron in August, 2000, after two years of heading Enron's ailing water company spin-off, Azurix . 
These days, as Enron struggles to stay afloat, Mark-Jusbasche (who hyphenated her name with that of her husband of two years) is watching the action from the sidelines. And she'd like to keep it that way. ``I'm very surprised and saddened by [what has happened at Enron], and I wish them all the best,'' she says. Beyond that, Mark-Jusbasche, 47, is not much interested in talking about Enron, which is being acquired by a small rival after a spectacular Wall Street flameout. Mark left Enron with millions of dollars worth of Enron shares, although she says she has sold them since. 
Mark-Jusbasche spends most of her time serving on advisory boards, both at Yale and Harvard business schools, as well as the school where her 16-year-old twin sons from a previous marriage are sophomores. 
In her spare time, she seeks out opportunities for investing. Currently, Mark-Jusbasche is considering alternative-energy and water-technology companies. A farm girl from Missouri, she has one investment focus that's especially dear to her heart: looking into expanding her cattle ranches. She now owns 15 acres in New Mexico. ``I'm doing things that are fun, interesting, and important to me--family and community,'' she says. Sure beats being anywhere near Enron.

Subject:	EOTT Hunt Pipeline Update

Stan & Phil - a quick update on the status of our activities on EOTT's Hunt Pipeline this week.

o	On Monday, Jordan and David Sztroin drove as much of the pipeline as possible in preparation for Tuesday's meeting.
o	On Tuesday, Jordan, David and Dan Cole met with representatives from Boots Smith Construction in Laurel, MS to discuss the project.  Discussion centered around the pipe size (10"" being the most likely), and what was included in the lump sum construction price from Boots Smith.
o	His price did not include a number of items, such as concrete coating, stream crossings, wetlands installation (including mats), directional drills, silt fencing, and several other identified items.  He has provided, or will provide, unit prices for some of these items; we will estimate the balance.  In addition, his price is for construction now, and could change if construction is delayed too long - how long is not defined.
o	He stated he was not interested in a total ""wrap"" turnkey project.  He works closely with an engineering company, but did not feel comfortable doing the entire project, including surveying, ROW, engineering, permitting, procurement, etc.  His price is only for normal construction.
o	On Wednesday, Jordan, David, Dan and I held a conference call.  I assured Dan that we would, as always, be diligent in trying to minimize cost and schedule while maintaining appropriate safety, quality and environmental parameters.

I have assigned Jordan as the Project Director for the project.  He is working to more clearly define the scope, standards, specifications, execution approach, cost and schedule.  We will advise the target schedule and revised cost estimate as soon as possible.  Of course, there are many permitting and environmental issues to overcome, and Jordan is working through those now; the survey needs to start ASAP in order to file for the permits.

Dan, if you have comments on my notes, or on the meeting, please let us know.  We're looking forward to working with you.

Thanks,
Jerry

PIPELINE NOTES FROM WASHINGTON
Vol. 4, No. 46
November 23, 2001

Association of Oil Pipe Lines
(202) 408-7970
(202) 408-7983 (fax)
bcooper@aopl.org

The opinions if any expressed in these notes are the author's only and do
not represent the views of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines (but they
should).


1.	Pipelines Announce Joint Push for Legislation

	Five pipeline associations, representing the vast majority of the domestic
pipeline deliveries of oil and natural gas, wrote to Department of
Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta this week pledging to cooperate in a
proactive approach to pipeline safety reauthorization legislation.  A number
of pipeline CEOs and trade association heads signed the letter, which
included a one-page position summary of the longer joint position paper we
reported on earlier (NOTES, No. 40, October 12, 2001).  This public
communication sends the important message that the pipeline industry is
united in its view of the need for reauthorization legislation and has
agreed on a core set of principles and provisions upon which this
legislation can be based.  We will have this correspondence up on our
website soon, but if you need a copy sooner, let us know and we'll send it
to you.

2.	Commission Denies Rehearing of Olympic Suspension

	The Commission this week denied Tesoro's request to suspend Olympic's
proposed rates for the full seven months permitted under the Interstate
Commerce Act.  The Commission found the order ""in the public interest as it
allows the increased rates to be collected, and during the period the
proposed rate increases are examined to determine whether they are just and
reasonable, they remain subject to refund.""  If Tesoro proves its case, it
will get refunds with interest.  If Olympic is prevented from collecting the
rates, that revenue is lost forever.  The Commission favored giving Olympic
the option of getting that revenue.  The order can be found at
http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\CIPS\OIL\IS\IS01-441.00E.TXT.

3.	OPS on Right-To Know Post Sept. 11

http://www.gopbi.com/partners/pbpost/epaper/editions/today/news_b3ff4359b34c
525c1000.html -- Sept. 11 has pipeline regulators rethinking public access
to records.

4.	FERC Releases New Search Engine

	The FERC has been upgrading and improving its website, www.ferc.gov.  Today
it announced the testing of a new search engine to help users find documents
more easily across FERC libraries and files.  For more on the new search
engine, see http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\CIPS\MISC\NR\NR01-59.000.TXT.

5.	EPA Seeks Comments on Diesel Emissions Standards

	EPA is seeking review and comment on a Staff Technical Paper regarding
non-road diesel emission standards.  According to the notice, EPA Staff
believes the Tier 3 standards in the regulations on emissions control are
feasible within the timeframe contemplated by the rule.  Now Staff will be
turning its attention to further particulate matter reduction in the
off-road diesel, ""to be addressed in a subsequent regulatory action.""
Comments on the Staff Technical Paper on emissions controls are due by
January 4, 2002.  A copy of the EPA notice may be found at page 58085 of the
Federal Register of November 20, 2001
(http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/fedreg/a011120c.html).   The Technical
Paper is available at http://www.epa.gov/otaq/equiphd.htm.
6.	Comment Period on Historic Pipelines Extended
	The Advisory Counsel on Historic Preservation has extended the comment
period on the program to streamline the historic preservation review process
for projects involving historic natural gas pipelines.  Comments will now be
accepted until December 10, 2001.  See the November 20, 2001 Federal
Register at page 58106
(http://www.access.gpo.gov/su_docs/fedreg/a011120c.html).  The program
proposal is available at www.achp.gov/news-pipelinecomment.html.
7.	REMINDER - AOPL Winter Meeting in January
	Last year, the Pipeline Leadership voted to move the AOPL Annual Winter
Meeting from December to January.  The meeting will be held in Washington,
DC on January 22-23, 2002.  Mark your calendars.  More information
concerning the meeting will be mailed to members the first week in December.

"RE: Daily Summary of Risk Data","


Summary Risk Data as of 11/26/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	     83	
Active Physical Positions	     38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	    69.7 	
VaR ($thousands)	   147.9 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	      0	
		




Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

"Rawhide; Whitewing","Per our earlier discussion:

Rawhide - No prohibition on sale of assets.  TGS, CEG, Border (common units), Gaspart, Centragas and Subic/Batangas are primary assets in Rawhide.  EGF is in the process of restructuring deal prior to 12/14 deadline.  Demonstration of some velocity on the sale of these assets would be extremely beneficial in negotiations with banks.

Whitewing - Approval from investors needed if we sell below the Whitewing purchase price (book value).  Asset sales package would need to be prepared and sent to investors in Whitewing (Osprey) who then have 10 days to approve sale. Typically, this has not been a problem, however, circumstances have since changed.  Gordon McKillop manages this process for Enron.

I am familiar with both transactions have the contacts within Global Finance for additional detail if we need it.

Dear Stanley:
  Before hand I'll let you know that we are doing great back home at Down
Under. We have bought our new home and are enjoying it completly. We
receives the photos that you sent us of the twins and we must congradulate
you that they are absolutly beautiful.
  Please let us know how you and the family are doing. I'll let you know
that I'm working doing a small delivery job for a Bakers Factory, nothing to
do with what I was doing but I like it just the same. It's a very early
start but I finish before lunch and that gives me time to look for a part
time job in the afternoon. After I spoke with Paul in the meeting, he said
that he was going to introduce me to other companies from the field, but I
haven't heard from him since then. I won't lose my hope to work for Enron
some day.
  Geraldine is doing fine and has two weeks left before the baby's due,
Chris is doing very good at school and keeping up very well with his soccer
training and Vicky is doing fine also and very happy with what's going on.
Do you still watch Stock Car racing? Let us know how things are going
because we haven't got cable tv yet so we are pretty left out on sport news.

"Daily Summary of Risk Data","

Summary Risk Data as of 11/19/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	     83	
Active Physical Positions	     38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	   (61.8)	
VaR ($thousands)	   163.3 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	       0	
		



Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Will do. You should be hearing from Antonino (""Toto"") Lo Bianco at Babcock & Brown, Mike Culhane of FBR, and Ingo Zemke of Alchemy.

Subject:	Cash Offers For Enron Wind Europe

Mark:

In the last two days, three private equity firms have told me they would be prepared to make all-cash offers for EW's European operations before December 31. These are Babcock & Brown (London), Alchemy (Frankfurt) and FBR (Washington DC).  Based on what I know about Enron Wind, I would bet that the price for the European operations alone would be signicantly more attractive for Enron than the price for the combined US and European operations.

I don't want to waste their time if it's too late. What should I tell them?

"Re: Methane Auto","Hello Stan,

I have not received any response from Lou Pai.  Is he still with Enron?  I did not get a return receipt from the e-mails I have sent to him.  

Do you have anyone else that may be interested in looking at this potential gas fueled auto technology that these entrepreneurs have?   

The reason why I contact you again on this is that the folks that wish to submit the unsolicited proposal to Enron called me again asking if we are interested.  

Sorry to bother you with this again, but if there is anyone else I can contact I would appreciate it. 

Regards,

Henry

Hello Stan,

Couple of people called me to inquire about Enron's interest in investing in a methane car kit and filling infrastructure.  They wanted to submit an unsolicited proposal to Enron.  I indicated to the that I would first check to see if Enron would be interested in a venture of this type.  According to these two gentlemen the return on investment is very good, ranging from 15% -  40%.  

Would Enron be interested in this type of business?

Regards,

Henry

"morning 6/5","Good morning.  How are you today?  Mom told me you called last night and would be at EOTT all day, but I know you can get your email there.  :)  So how does the rest of the week look for lunch?  Are you free Wed. or Thurs.?  Let me know.  Next week I'll be gone to Regionals!!  I can't believe it has come up so fast.  I can't wait, but I also remember just how unpredictable Regionals can be so I don't want to get my hopes up about anything.  Of course, my two kids are being little angels which is making me feel pretty good about my chances so we'll see what happens.  Well, I better go do some actual work (although no one is even here yet so I'm not sure what exactly I'm supposed to do this morning), but oh well.  I'll talk to you later.  Have a good day.  I love you!!!
Love,
Caron

As you know, BG has been diligently attempting to get waivers from Reliance and ONGC that would ensure that BG would be the operator of the concessions after closing of the sale.  We currently have an agreement with BG that all negotiations must be completed by November 20 or the deal will lapse.

Reliance has been actively negotiating with BG while ONGC has been stonewalling at the direction of the GOI.  We believe that the GOI ultimately wants this transaction to happen, but not before DPC is resloved.

Now that the merger with Dynegy has been announced it is possible that ONGC will continue to stonewall with BG and attempt to become the operator.  (The merger will cause a change of control and entitle the partners to remove us, or our successor, as operator - all of which was disclosed to Dynegy.)

BG has yet to reach final agreement with Reliance.  We anticipate that BG and Reliance will ultimately reach an agreement.

The Chairman of BG, Dick Giordano, now wants us to extend the deadline until December 21 and allow him time to personally go to India and make a concerted effort to conclude negotiations.  BG further wants us to provide an additional indemnity on cost recovery and to reduce the purchase price by $10 million to give the room to offer more value to Reliance and ONGC.

Our recommendation is as follows:

Have Giordano call Lay and ask for the extension, let Lay give it but deliver the ""this is it"" message.

Refuse to modify the agreement - no reduction in purchase price or additional indemnity.

Use what leverage we may have with the GOI to put pressure on ONGC to grant BG the waiver.

Prepare the Ratings Agencies and investors for a failed deal.

"Supplement","
Bless FERC - there are a number of important orders that have come out late Friday so I will be doing a supplemental report on Monday.

However, please note...

Chair Hebert announed that J. Mark Robinson will head the Office of Energy Projects replacing Dan Adamson. Mark has served as OEP director of Environmental/Engineering Review since 1999. He joined FERC in 1978 and has held various posts since then. Robert Cupina is to serve as Deputy Director, having most recently served as Director of the Division of Rates/Tariffs Central. He joined FERC in 1973.Both appointments are effective immediately.

http://cips.ferc.fed.us/Q/CIPS/MISC/NR/NR01-26.000.TXT

PUC v. El Paso Natural Gas, RP00-24. What is interesting here is that the Chief ALJ is requesting guidance from the Commission to determine whether there should be a more complete record regarding any possibility of affilate standards. The case is far more complex than originally anticipated in the March 28 order (with 17 days of hearings, three linear feet of exhibits and 2,700 pages thus far in testimony. Six rebuttal witnesses remain to be heard from and it is anticipated the hearing will continue all next week)Due to the complexity, Chief ALJ Wagner recommends that the parties be given thirty days from June 8, 2001 (July 9) for filing proposed findings of fact and initial briefs. Further, the reply briefs should be filed no later than July 24, 2001. The ALJ on the case will issue the initial decision within 30 days after reply briefs are filed. It is requested that the Commission waive the initial decision date in this case.

As you may have become aware, the company received notice yesterday that you have been named as defendants (along with Enron Corp., Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, Andy Fastow, and Arthur Andersen) in one of the federal securities class actions.  I will forward to you a copy of the Complaint.  We are in the process of determining who would be the most effective counsel for you.

Subject:	MBA Class


Stan. I am a glutton for punishment with now pursuing my MBA. But it is energizing (pardon, the pun) and very enjoyable. In light of this, I am to interview a leader about certain aspects of leadership, i.e. does leadership develop with experience, have there been one or two instrumental experiences that were signficant in developing your own leadeship style?

As my leader, would you have about 30 minutes or so, sometime this week, to discuss your ideas about leadership with me? To maximize your time, I would be glad to provide all questions in advance so I don't waste any time.

Please let me know and I hope you can visit with me.

Subject:	Re: Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy  

I have done a lot of thinking these past few days and have decided to share my thoughts with you and the board of directors. I mean, after all, FACTS are friendly....Right?!

I have had the utmost respect for Enron and the board for all of my 23 years - thru mergers and name changes and cuts and all the ups and downs. Let me just stop beating around the bush, and just get down to the bottom line here.

I, like everyone else out here have some questions and comments for you. I want you to get down to our terms and answer these in layman's terms - we understand pistons & crankshafts and nuts & bolts, so please keep all of you acronyms out of it.

Where in the world did you get the questions for the MergerQ&A?
Someone has messed around with our retirement, our livelyhood and our families!
Do you really think we give a flip about what Enron field is named?
Do you really think we care if the Enron body shop stays open?
Do you really think we care about the United Way right now???
NO! We have been cheated out of money here! Have you ever put a pencil to it? - Probably not, since your wages total in the $MM figure!

Let's just do that, let's figure out what a measley 1000 shares calculates to before and what it will be upon the merge!
1000 X $80+ = $80,000+ - early 2001
1000 X $40 = $40,000 - mid 2001
1000 X .2685 = 268.5 X let's say... $40 = $10,740 - next year
Ouch! And that is a comparison to our stock - NOT  our stock OPTIONS!

I and everyone else out here want to be compensated for what has happened - you had guys bailing out with $30+MM. They will be sitting high on the hog and we have people looking at a measley $15,000 plus the thought of losing their jobs with the merger.

How ironic that the Code of Ethics is sent out immediately after your merger e-mail! Does the board of directors EVER read that document??? We read it MANY times a year!! Perhaps you should practice what you all preach!

Have you had a stranger walk up to you on the street and ask ""What have YOU done to the stock?""
Well, that is happening out here! What have we done to deserve this treatment? Nothing, but cut ourselves down to the meanest, leanest teams around only to have something like this slapped in our faces.

I am ashamed, embarrassed, and MAD.

1. What happened?
2. Who did it?
3. We want compensation

What should I say now? Hmmm....
GO DYNEGY
