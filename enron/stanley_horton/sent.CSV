Gary, I have a question and I can't seem to get a real good answer so I will ask you.

I have quite a lot of money in the stable asset fund that I am told I cannot get until I terminate. My question is this, Where is that money? Is it safe from all that is going on? is it with some other company in some type of trust? Is it safe from being used by the company officers? What happens to it if I survive the merger? What happens to it if bankruptcy occurs?

Any help you can give me about this would be appreciated.

thanks    al

I imagine you often get notes of appreciation, but I wanted to add my note of thanks for taking the time to speak to ETS in 3AC this afternoon. 

You came across as a Leader that demonstrated compassion, honesty, sincerity, credibility, and understanding. You told people their opinions were important, and that you understood how they felt. You clearly stated that what happened should not have happened. Despite the fact that you were not part of the collapse, you apologized as part of the management team.

You spoke positively of the future, of the new company, and of the people that would be at the helm in the new company. 

In todays environment, Leaders need to be seen and heard. I sincerely believe employees want to regain a level of trust in the company and leaders they thought they knew. 

I believe you made a positive step in making that happen with your comments today. 

Again, thanks. I do hope you plan to provide the future leadership for 'Dynegy T&D' assets.

Subject:	Floor Space Announcement


I was very disappointed to not have any advance warning about the announcement that construction on 41 has been put on hold for financial reasons.

The Gas Logistics team was ""relocated"" off the 41st floor on October 5.  Prior to the move, we had a very efficient, open configuration that let us work together as a unified team.  

After the move, we are located on 3 different floors.   Besides the general impact on team unity, this move also means that our evening staff work alone on separate floors, rather than in a group.  It means fewer individuals to cover customer calls.  It means having more equipment to cover the day to day business.   I have worked hard to calm the team that this arrangement is just temporary and that we will eventually be put back together as a team.

Prior to our move I constantly questioned whether our move was necessary.  I asked about smaller, more practical changes to fit more people on the floor.  And, I specifically asked about whether Enron issues might impact the groups desire to continue to spend $7-$10 million -- even as I reluctantly packed up my boxes.

I hope you can appreciate that the current seating arrangement is a serious issue for my team and one that generates constant questions as my staff meetings.  Finding out  that we moved off of 41 for no reason at an all-employee floor meeting undermines my team's faith in my leadership.

Also, I would not want to announce anything until the deal closes.  Preannouncing a deal of this size isn't goi8ng to stabilize anything.  $1 to $2 BILLION might get a different answer.

Subject:	Potential Deal

Stan/Jeff:

I have been contacted by a number of close friends/business contacts that want to put together a deal to buy a number of our smaller assets, primarily the power assets.  The strategy they have in mind is simple.  They want to offer us a lightning quick sale of a package of small non-core assets that together would be a material deal that could be announced and help stabilise our situation.  They would then be able to manage in a more orderly manner either the sale or continued operation of the assets and hopefully realise a premium over what they pay us.  They have power and energy industry experience.  In the interest of full disclosure, they asked me to participate in the deal, but I have said that probably makes a negotiated deal unlikely given the related party concerns.  I indicated if they want to do a deal, they will have to leave me out of it. They have indicated a willingness to conduct due diligence over ten days, sign an agreement and announce the deal and then close by end of the year, but only if we can begin immediately.  They are assuming we would put a priority on both announcing and funding a deal quickly.  They are willing to structure around issues to meet this objective.

I intend to meet with these guys and make my own judgement as to the legitimacy of the proposal.  I think they are considering a transaction of between 100 - 200 million.  It would probably involve a half dozen or so assets.  Not a huge deal, but it would efficiently get rid of some cats and dogs.  It probably qualifies as a ""fire sale"", but might make sense anyway.

Your thoughts?

Subject:	GISB Board of Directors Officers for 2002

Dear GISB Board Members,

Bill  Boswell,  Hugh  Roberts  and  Julie Gomez, GISB's chairman, first and
second vice chairs, respectively, assumed office at the March 2001 meeting.
Under  established  guidelines Hugh would have become the 2002 chairman and
Julie  the  first vice chair; however, due to a reassignment, Hugh resigned
from the board and GISB was left without a first vice chairman.

The  Producer Segment directors have informed the GISB Office they have not
yet decided on a replacement for Hugh as first vice chairman, but in any
event none of them desire to  assume  the Chairmanship in March 2002.
Likewise, Julie Gomez has also declined  to  assume the Chairmanship,
although she is willing to remain as
vice  chairman  for  the  coming  year.   Therefore,  the  Producer Segment
directors and Julie Gomez of the Services Segment, are requesting Bill
Boswell to
continue  as  chairman throughout 2002, and these segments will then resume
their  rotation at the end of Bill's extended term.  This is similar to the
situation  which  occurred  when Steve Chesebro' continued as chairman from
June  1994  to  March 1996, after which, Mary Jane McCartney rotated to the
chairmanship.

Bill  Boswell  was  asked  and has agreed to do so long as it was clear the
request  was  from  the Producer Segment as next in line for the chair, and
provided Julie Gomez as second in line also requested this to be handled in
that manner.  This has been done with both the producer directors and Julie
also requesting this issue be clarified now so as to provide GISB and NAESB
with clear continuity into next year.

Pursuant  to  the bylaws, the existing officers will continue through 2002;
therefore,   Bill   Boswell   will  continue  as  chairman,  the  producers
subsequently  will  name  a  first vice chair in place of Hugh Roberts, and
Julie Gomez will remain as second vice chair.

I look forward to seeing you in Houston or hearing from you over the phone on
December 5 -- Best Regards, Rae

I have really enjoyed it since Stan-the-Man got involved, and the morale and operating results show how positive that was for the company.  I have also been a long time admirer of Good-Golly-Miss-Molly and loved working with Walt Zimmerman.  So, it is my hope and sincere recommendation that Walt be selected to succeed me.  He has demonstrated repeatedly that he is capable of doing the job -- in fact, he has been doing the job for a long time, all except the actual taking of the minutes, and he has relieved me of that duty on more than one occasion.  He's a person of integrity, loyalty, and dedication, and I know the Directors like him.  I hope you two agree.
 
I'll miss you guys, and Mollie, I'd love to have lunch with you and Walt anytime.  I'll also be available for any help and advice that I can give.
 
Thanks again.
 
Much love, Peggy Sue

There apparently was a proposal made at the last VP PRC Committee meeting to retitle the Commercial Support peer group to ""Professional Services"" (see note below).  Let me know if you are opposed to this, otherwise I will indicate ETS' support for this change later this week.

Subject:	Proposal to Change ""Commercial Support"" peer group label to ""Professional Services""

At the VP PRC meeting last Wednesday, Dave Delainey proposed we consider retitling the Commercial Support peer group as above. Apparently this suggestion was made and broadly supported at a policy committee meeting a few weeks ago. The suggestion is that the Support label is seen rather negatively across the organisation and the new label may be an improvement.

The VP PRC Committee resolved that they would be open to supporting a change, subject to the senior leads from across CS providing their views/support.

I volunteered to circulate this note to the 2 of you in EWS and ask my colleagues from HR to share with their CS leads to solicit their views before returning to the committee late next week with summarised reaction. Perhaps you would provide me with your views and a vote for or against? 

I would strongly recommend that we do broadly discuss this outside a small circle of people.

Following up on our lunch meeting in Houston, there are 3 positions which I want to fill, preferably by the end of the year:
	
	1.  CFO.  With Tod's part-time status as of Jan 1, we will need a CFO.  That person can sit either in Texas or California.  

	2.  Americas - GM. I want to fill the Americas VP/General Manager position.  This person will have overall P&L responsibility for our Americas business unit and will manage our US commercial, engineering, manufacturing and O&M activities.  This is a critical day-to-day operating position and I am certainly not giving it the needed attention.  This person needs to sit in California and spend a significant amount of his or her time in Tehachapi.  I really do not have an internal candidate whom I would be comfortable placing in this role and view this as an opportunity to further upgrade our senior management ranks.  I want to find a superstar to fill this role! 

	3.  Americas - O&M.  I need to add a senior O&M person in the US (a #2 who can mature into #1).  We are recruiting for this position externally, but if you know of any good candidates who might be interested, that would be great. 

 I will set up a time to talk with you about all three positions  - clearly, if there are qualified Enron candidates that are looking for a home/new challenge, I would be very interested.  Adam

I can assure you that at times I too feel that I do not know everything that is going and that is probably correct.  I can tell you that Jeff McMahon did receive the offer from the Royal Bank of Scotland at or around RAB.  I have supplied him the potential financial impact of Enron accepting that offer.  As of yesterday no decision had been made about responding to their offer.  I suspect that a decision should be made early next week.  I would appreciate your thoughts as soon as you can supply them to me.

Ken Lay and Dynegy have both characterised Enron's investments in water assets as non-core which means of cource that they will be divested in due time.  I would think that that would be the final straw that triggers the goodwill impairment.  We all recommended that if Enron could not support the goodwill remaining on the books then we should proceed with trying to sell Wessex at or around RAB.  That is where we are right now.  Again, please send me your comments.  I would try to keep this confidential since we have not yet made a descision.  I am sorry if I have not done a good job of communicating with you the past few weeks.  Things are quite hectic as you can imagine.

Subject:	Wessex Weekly Update

Stan,

1.	There is still considerable speculation that Wessex is to be sold by
Enron.  Bill Alexander, CEO of Thames Water is quoted as saying ""We cannot
offer as much as Enron paid but we can make Enron a better company"".  Since
Thames is well behind Wessex in all the efficiency and service comparators,
it is difficult to see quite how he intends to improve Wessex!  Any proposal
by another UK water and wastewater company to buy Wessex would trigger an
automatic Competition Commission reference.  Previous references to the
Competition Commission have resulted in such combinations not being allowed.
The Director General of Water Services has said publicly that he would
oppose such combinations.

2.	The Royal Bank of Scotland have called to tell us ""as a matter of
courtesy"", that they will be submitting an offer for Wessex.  I believe it
will be ""at or around"" the RAB value and will be sent to Geoff MacMahon.
Our response to RBS and to others who have called has been that our
understanding is that Enron are not seeking to sell Wessex at this time and
to refer them to Houston.

3.	We remain on course to meet the full year earnings target.  This is
despite having to make greater provisions than we expected to restructure
Swiss Combi Technology following the decision of Andritz to terminate
discussions to buy the company.

4.	The ?50m index linked private placement is currently with the
lawyers.  We are on track to close the transaction two weeks today.

5	We will need to begin the process of renegotiating our committed
bank facilities soon.  We are proceeding as previously agreed with Ben
Glisan.

6.	 We have been contacted privately by S&P who have told us that they
are likely to put Wessex and AEL on credit watch (developing) to reflect the
financial uncertainties around Enron and the future ownership of Wessex.

Colin

Stan,
I know that you are overloaded with all the company issues, but I just wanted to relay a few thoughts.  First of all, thank you for the words of encouragement and confidence at your floor meeting.  This is a very difficult time for all of us, but you especially have a big burden.  Your openness, honesty and confidence was very reassuring.  Other thoughts on my mind are just concerns about Steve Hotte leaving the organization given all the other changes.  Would it be possible for you to ask Steve to stay given the current situation?  I would think he would be very concerned about his change moving into ENA right now.  He might reconsider a move if you discuss it with him.  Finally, if it is best for him to move on, I feel it is extremely important to have someone in that job that understands our business.  I think Steve's business knowledge and ability to work closely with the Commercial group is what has made him so effective.  The Technology group's greatest challenge is never technology itself, but rather understanding the business so that technology can be appropriately applied.  I am aware that Brad Holmes is on the short list and just want to say that I have been very impressed with him.  He has very good knowledge of our business and has good technical savvy.  He has developed a very good working relationship with the IT organization and I have enjoyed working with him.  I would feel very good with him in that position if we have to loose Steve.  I understand there are several other candidates to consider and that this will be a difficult decision.  I will certainly support and respect whatever decision you make.  Thanks for listening and I'll keep you in my prayers for strength as we work through the toughest days that we have ever faced as Enron employees.

For Portland General Electric, week of April 23, 2001
1)Announcement of termination of Enron and Sierra Pacific deal was uneventful,
and not surprising to employees and Portland Community.
2)Time was spent in addressing questions from data room in San Francisco.
3)FERC ordered the Cal ISO to file by 6/1/01, a RTO proposal with FERC. At the
same time FERC's approval of the effort by the 9 NW utilities (IOUs plus BPA)
to form RTO West was conditioned on making a 12/1/01 compliance filing that
addresses seams issues with California and Canada, and a timetable for
creating a West-wide RTO. Together, these orders should help prevent
California's efforts to balkanize their power system.
4)FERC's order on RTO West gave a boost to the inclusion within the RTO of the
independent-for-profit transmission company (TransConnect) proposed by 6 of
the 9 RTO utilities including PGE. Relying heavily on TransConnect's
independence, the Commission approved TransConnect's proposal to file for
innovative and incentive rates.
5)Wholesale sales continue strong in a robust market.
6)Thermal plants are in sequential annual  maintenance outages.
7)Hydro plants operations are reduced due to poor water condition in NW.
8)Contract negotiations continue with IBEW Local 125. Next meeting is
scheduled for May 7.
9)Customer Information System installation is approaching 75% completion,
being on schedule, and under budget.
10)Joint Meter Reading project is on target with 850,000 routes now merged
with NW Natural Gas.
11)SB 1149, Oregon's version of deregulation, is still uncertain in the
legislature. We are ready to implement on whatever timeframe is decided.
12)We plan to submit another fast track small microturbine generating plant
for RAROC next week.
13)Senator Gordon Smith reception held to keep contact on issues around price
caps, and there determental effect on energy markets and new generation.    

>>> Horton, Stanley 04/23/01 02:57PM >>>
I would appreciate if each of you could provide a brief (one-page or less)
bullet point summary of the week's activity by close of business each Friday. 
You can send either via e-mail or fax.

Jeff has his staff meetings on Monday mornings and it would help me keep him
abreast of key activities in your respective areas.

I don't need anything elaborate.

Howdy Daddy!!!!  Wassup!?!?!?!  Not much  here.  I just got out of my b.law test and am proud to report that I  thought it was easy and am pretty sure I did really well on it.  I will try  to be on the computer more in the evenings.  I guess it's one of those  whenever I'm on you're not and whenever you're on I'm not because I never see  you on when I am in the evenings.  I will try to catch you online at night  though because I miss our evening chats on the IM too.  I love you and  can't wait to be home for 4 days over Thanksgiving.  I've missed seeing you  so much.  We've both been so busy and have had a hard time getting together  lately.  We'll go do some fun stuff and spend some quality father/daughter  time over Thanksgiving break though.  I really do miss you bunches.   Anyway, I better get going.  I have a bunch of homework and an accounting  test to study for so I better get to it.  The weather here today is really  nasty too.  There was a tornado in Boerne and it hit Double Diamond where  the horses used to be and ripped the roof off of the main barn.  Creepy  huh.

Stan,

I had the opportunity to participate in the Table Talk session yesterday at
EOTT and want to follow up with you on the topic of employee growth and
development.  Thanks to EOTT's tuition reimbursement program, I will be
completing my undergraduate degree this summer at UST (although I ""walked""
two weeks ago).  My degree is in General Studies (concentrations in
Business Administration and International Studies).  I am graduating Summa
Cum Laudeand received the Outstanding Graduate award in my degree program,
along with honors in English, Philosophy and Adult Education.  I intend to
start the MBA program at UST in Spring 2002.

I would like to find a position within your organization where I can learn
the business, provide value to the company as well as advance myself.  I
mention that I am graduating with honors not to pat myself on the back but
to impress upon you that I will apply the same focus and desire for
excellence in any position I undertake.  Naturally, I would like to stay
within the Enron companies not only because I have 7 years invested
already, but because Enron is the place to work and grow.  I am open to any
position where there is an opportunity for learn, grow and advance.  As
with my studies, I find the more I become aware of and learn, the more I
want to learn.  I know I could do a great job within an organization given
the opportunity.

Any advice or assistance in finding a position or internship would be
greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Subject:	Confidential - Decision tree on projects

Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting.

There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaza.  In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans.  SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem.  Panama is much less (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year.  Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM.  In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama.  The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from actions taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with private parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a ""mark"" on the company's liquidity position.  

Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence?  The same could go for SECLP and Gaza.

This is simply an overall ""guidance"" question.  Let's take it up during our staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you.

Many thanks, Mariella

It sounds like the due diligence with UBS is going fairly well with no real surprise.  The news is good on Indian Mesa I and II both on the deal with AEP and the financing.  The real target is completion of the project on time.

I am concerned about slippage again on Q2 due to the Greek project slippage and German installations being behind schedule.  I am looking forward to seeing the Q2 numbers very soon.

What is the issue on the L&S gearbox and what is the potential impact on 01 earnings given your statement that if we do not pass the test, it will present significant problems for 01 US sales.

Let's talk by phone this week if possible.

Hi Stan,
 
Given all of the other issues you are, undoubtedly, handling for Enron these days, I wonder if you could do us the big favor of talking to El Paso's chairman (Weiss, spelling?).  Attached you will find an outline of a strategy for a cooperation undertaking between El Paso's power asset in the Dominican Republic (called CEPP, approximately 67 MW of barge mounted diesel engines, also selling power to the CDE, the government owned utility which has had a terrible payment record) and SECLP.  
 
We have tried to work with El Paso's Latin America folks but there seems to be little or no interest in pushing forward an aggressive agenda; at least not with Enron.  If you could find some time just to mention these issues to him and let him know that we are very much interested in working with his team, that would be great.
 
Thank you very much.

Mariella, I cannot get El Paso to comment on this proposal nor give a commitment to anything more than agreeing to work together.  They don't disagree with the concept attached or the fact that we may want to be shut down at the same time to cause the GoDR to address us seriously.  I can't tell if they are not ready to commit or they just want to keep their options open for a while.
 
I believe it would be good to give this to Stan and have him talk to his counterpart at El Paso, acknowledging that the groups are working together to achieve a common goal of realizing the stranded costs.  It might put some pressure on the indecision at the lower ranks.

Subject: District Cooling Project - Project Financing 


We are in the process of closing with US Bank on our financing for the
construction of the first phase of this project for $13 million.  We are
working with the Enron Corp. - Corporate Financing group to obtain a corporate
guarantee for the financing.  This project is currently in PGH2 and is part of
what is being sold with PGE.  The financing guarantee will contemplate this
sale and will allow for the assignment of the guarantee to the new buyer as
long as they meet an agreed upon financial standards (ie. BBB+).  Since we are
under ETS you or Stan might get questions on the project and I wanted to
provide you an overview of the project.

Mahendra Shah of our treasury group has had a conversation with Greg Caudell
and Jim Newgard (both report to Tm Despain) at Enron Corp. Corporate Finance
about the Enron Guaranty for the US Bank construction facility (up to $13
million). He has forwarded to them, the US bank's draft of the Enron guaranty.
 They indicated that the guaranty would probably be redrafted by Clement
Abrams using the standard Enron format.  
 
If you have any questions on the District Cooling Project or need additional
information we can set up a conference call and go over the various aspects of
the project.  We also have the financial model available that we can forward
to you that was reviewed and was the basis of Enron's approval.

Stan, I wanted to thank you again for the time you took from your busy day to visit with us concerning the future of our company.  I as well as many of the employees in Enron took some risks with our stock and 401K and lost almost everything we have worked 28+ years, based on what Mr. Skilling advised.  You were right that we suffered a severe blow to both our company image as well as our future personal plans.  

I also realize you did not promise us anything and know that you cannot, but it really felt great to hear your encouraging words.  Yes we have had a great loss, but with time (and a job with our new company) can replace some of the loss.  It takes time to heal from these financial wounds, but if we continue to communicate with management and between employees, we can again be proud of what we have worked so many years to build.  It has really been great to work with you through these past few years and look to you to lead us into our new world.

We are all shocked to read the news although I guess given the way the press
and the markets have acted recently not surprised.

For the employees here we are delivering a very clear business as usual
message.  Press enquiries we are routing to Enron.  The UK press is full of
speculation that Wessex Water is to be sold.

When the dust settles it will be useful to discuss what happens now.  In
particular we need to decide how we deal with AEL refinancing etc.

There is no rush but when you have a minute I would welcome a word.

Dear Stan,

Given the current state of affairs here in the D.C. office, I am forwarding my resume for your review.  The lion's share of my legal experience has been with Enron's regulated pipelines, both domestic and overseas.  I appreciate your keeping me in mind should needs or opportunities arise in the pipeline group, whether these be as an employee or on a contract basis.

Thanks for your consideration!

It's cool to  read the WSJ now compared to freshman year when we used it in economics because  now I really understand the terminology they use!!!  It's a cool  feeling.  Anyway, my day is going well.  I talked to Jennifer this  morning and she said Rose is doing well today and getting better so that's  good.  She was going to try and talk to the vet to see if he'd talked to  the toxicologist at A&M yet so if I hear anything about that I'll let you  know.  I get to register for classes Monday (YIKES!!!!) and have made up my  schedule.  It's all business classes I'm required to take but I'll go over  it with you tonight.

I realize it's been a tough year and at the very least, these are trying times.  However, I ask that you consider a donation to support Texas Special Olympics.  On November 17, Enron bowlers will participate in the third annual bowl-a-thon to support this worthwhile organization.   

Texas Special Olympics is a year-round sports training and competition program, patterned after the Olympic Games, which gives people with mental retardation the chance to strengthen their character, develop their physical skills, display their talents , and fulfill their human potential.  

Special Olympics believes that through sports training and competition, people with mental retardation are benefited physically, mentally, socially, and spiritually; families are strengthened; and the community at large, both through participation and observation, is united with mentally retarded people in an environment of equality, respect, and acceptance.

All money raised from this event will be used to provide financial support to assist the Special Olympics programs located in the Southern and Southeastern regions of Texas.

Once again, please consider a donation.

Thank you in advance for your generosity.

Pledges may be made by responding to this email.

Hello Stan,

Couple of people called me to inquire about Enron's interest in investing in a methane car kit and filling infrastructure.  They wanted to submit an unsolicited proposal to Enron.  I indicated to the that I would first check to see if Enron would be interested in a venture of this type.  According to these two gentlemen the return on investment is very good, ranging from 15% -  40%.  

Would Enron be interested in this type of business?

Regards,

Henry

I have quite a lot of money in the stable asset fund that I am told I cannot get until I terminate. My question is this, Where is that money? Is it safe from all that is going on? is it with some other company in some type of trust? Is it safe from being used by the company officers? What happens to it if I survive the merger? What happens to it if bankruptcy occurs?

Any help you can give me about this would be appreciated.

Subject:	Confidential - GSS Organization Value to ETS


Here are my thoughts on the value the GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) brings to ETS:

I believe totally in the concept of strategically sourcing our materials and services for ETS, which is the concept that GSS was founded under, while still within the ETS organization.  Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS.   The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are:

*	The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine.
*	Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000.
*	ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more.
*	New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's.
*	Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy).
*	GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing.
*	ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register.


If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals)

*	Two (2) negotiators - Contract Managers
*	Two (2) analysts
*	Two (2) contract administrators

The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC:

*	iBuyit System
*	Catalog system (part of iBuyit)
*	iPayit system

We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department.   This would take very few staff adds to make that happen.

Let me know if you need any further detail.

Stan, I know you have a lot going on right now and probably don't need more emails that seem to be coming from off the wall but I felt the need to express some of my thoughts about what's going on right now and I hope you will take just a minute to listen.  As you get older, you seem to reflect more on things that are happening around you and how it affects you and those around you.  Some might perceive this message as ""sucking up"" or ""jockeying for position"" but nothing could be farther from the truth.  This one is from the heart.  

First, I want to say that I believe that many of us in the pipelines have taken for granted over the years the kind and quality of leadership that we have had.  I want to thank you for being the kind of leader that you have been, one that's honest, straight forward, tells it like it is and yet will make the tough calls when they need to be made, but always in the interest of the company, the employees and its shareholders.  I've been fortunate to be able to work with you over the last ten or so years and know that you have lived the Enron values.  Had others run their business units the way you have run the pipes, I truly belive that we would not be where we are at today. Thank you for being the kind of leader you are.  I for one appreciate it.   

For those of us that have poured our hearts and souls into this company for most of our life, these are tough times and I know that you can certainly relate to that.  And while my financial well being and security has certainly been impacted, there are others out there far worse off than me and I actually feel like I am truly blessed.  Blessed to have been a part of such a great company, blessed to work with the kind of people that have made this company what it is and blessed to have the opportunity to rebuild a new and even better company.  There are things in life much more important than money, family (grandsons), life, challenges in your work, health and happiness.  I don't know what the future holds for me or the company, I just know it's part of a much bigger plan that I can't control.  I also know that we can't look back.  What's done is done and it happend for a reason.  What we have to do is move on.  If there's a meaningful  role for me as we go forward, I will approach it with the same commitment, dedication and enthusiasm that I have any job I have had.  If there's not, I'm at peace with that too.  The success of this company, past, present and future will always be in our people.  Thanks for the time and thanks for the leadership you have provided ETS all these years.  

WOW, does this sound depressing or what?  It's really not meant to be.  I have a great attititude about what the future holds. Have a great day.

I have quite a lot of money in the stable asset fund that I am told I cannot get until I terminate. My question is this, Where is that money? Is it safe from all that is going on? is it with some other company in some type of trust? Is it safe from being used by the company officers? What happens to it if I survive the merger? What happens to it if bankruptcy occurs?

Any help you can give me about this would be appreciated.

"Eco Progress","I think this is a good summary of where we are:

1.  QF Status:  Mirant is willing to provide a legal opinion that it meets the QF status under the PPA if it is required to close.

2.  A market report should be issued by Mirant today as to the reasons they have only been able to secure $300 million instead of $500 million in insurance.  Hopefully this will satisfy the lenders.

3.  Mirant's proposal went out today on how to protect the lenders if the SHO is extinguished.

4.  Mirant and GE have agreed to a closing checklist and fee coverage.

Things left to do:

1Finalize all documents

2.  Receive underwriter approval on the resolution of all insurance claims.

3.Agree upon mirror guarantees with Enron and Mission relating to the Union Carbide guarantees.

Jeff Donahue informs me that CFSB feels secure that this deal will close on December 15 but not before.  The reason is that there are PPA bids that need to go out by that date.

Let's keep daily status reports coming. If I have misrepresented anything in the summary, please let me know.

My apologies - I obviously misunderstood the message from last week.  I should have called you to discuss before firing off my memo.  We are doing everything possible to accelerate cash and reduce expenses in the short-term, including financing our Dutch blade facility.  We are working to put in place a bank line for working capital, although that will take a bit of time to arrange.  We are also working to defer vendor payments over the next several weeks.  Our key focus remains getting IMI/Clear Sky closed.  Our deal team is in Columbus, Ohio meeting with AEP this week and our goal is to get a PSA signed with AEP by month end, then complete the project and close the sale and term financing in December!  I met with one of AEP's senior guys in Abilene last week - but for credit concerns over Enron Wind and Enron, he continues to say all the right things about the project purchase. Next step is to sign the PSA.  Adam

Quite frankly I am getting tired of memos like this!  There has not been a decision not to provide short-term liquidity for Enron Wind.  If there was I would have called.  Enron is in the midst of a liquidity crisis.  I need the support of the entire team as does Enron to help us get through this.  I need you to see the bigger picture and to think of ways that Wind can help.  I need cost reductions, improved cash flow and SUPPORT.

Subject:	Wind Company

While I understand that the Wind Co is clearly a ""non-core"" asset for Enron,  I am very concerned about the apparent decision in Houston not to provide short-term liquidity for our operations (I have heard that the wind co is on its own for cash  going forward). While I am probably more eager than anyone to have the Wind Co regain its financial independence, I can not do it overnight and am worried about the potentially devasting impact which a lack of short-term capital will have on our business and, quite directly, the value of this asset to Enron.

 As you know, our lenders on IMI/Clear Sky have refused to fund a construction loan (they will not take Enron equity bridge risk) - this construction loan was the most important piece of our working capital/cash funding for Q4.  AEP and its lenders on IMI/Clear Sky are also expressing serious concern about the Enron warranty guaranty (we will likely have to reserve cash to secure our warranty obligations, further exacerbating our cash position).  FPL and AEP have in essence put on hold their deals with Enron Wind pending some clarity on how Enron's liquidity difficulties may affect Enron Wind.  AEP has gone as far as saying the Enron Wind is probably BK without working capital support from Enron, and are understandably asking why should they be comfortable with our performance risk?  Our European vendors, still mindful of Tacke's bankruptcy in 1997, are extremely concerned about our financial condition.  And a number of our counterparties who owe us money but are also owed money by Enron affiliates are seeking to set-off those obligations.  While I will have better numbers over this weekend, without the IMI/Clear Sky construction loan, I will need between $30-35mm through the end of the year (until the AEP sale closes) in order to meet our working capital needs.  Without that support, I can almost guaranty you I will not be able to sell IMI/Clear Sky to AEP and am worried about our short-term financial survival.  

Stan - this clearly has serious implications for the value of Enron Wind and our sales effort.  I am meeting again with my finance team (such as it is) over the weekend and on Monday morning.  I will set up some time with you on Monday or Tuesday to discuss.  I know there is no desire to support the Wind Co medium to long-term, but a decision to cut us off now could be fatal.   

Adam

I can only imagine how full your plate is.  Thanks for your visits on the different floors to communicate with ETS personnel.

In these trying times at Enron, everyone is looking to strong, honest leadership to get us throuh this.  Please consider having Steve Hotte remain on board as ETS' CIO for the time being.  He is truly the single, best person I've ever worked for and believe his leadership is much more valuable in ETS than in another area of Enron right now.  

At least ensure Steve has the choice to remain at ETS or move on.  Should he decide to move on, I would respect that and support anyone you name as his replacement.

Larry -- I don't know what the plans are for Enron Wind given recent events.  However, I've cc'd Adam Umanoff, the CEO at Enron Wind, to introduce the two of you.  Please feel free to follow up with him directly.
 
Adam -- I met Larry at a NREL conference a few weeks ago.  Larry runs a small start-up that is developing a behind-the-tower design which allows for lower cost construction.  Even if his contemplated transaction is of no interest, you may enjoy learning about his technology.
 
Please call me if you have any questions or comments.
 
Thanks

Hello Heath,
 
Thanks for returning my call.
 
The Wind Turbine Company (WTC) is interested in exploring the possiblity of taking over Enron Wind Corporation with the idea of selling off the European operations and all existing manufacturing operations.  We are interested in the company's North American wind operations and the properties held for development.
 
As you know, WTC is a small company, however, we are talking with a few large companies about investing in our company and prospectively taking an active role in the wind industry.  Enron Wind's existing windfarms would form an excellent operating base for us, providing properties to develop, and significant opportunities to deploy our new machines through the redevelopment of projects now employing the European style machine.
 
I would appreciate any guidance you provide.
 
Best regards,
 
Larry Miles

Hi Stan,

I am sorry this took so long to reply to but I was out of the office yesterday with my little one on a field trip.  

Here is the feedback (combined with my own appreciation of how people feel) and some very humble suggestions that I hope will help.

During the EGAS session, people felt very good about being able to air out their concerns and about getting ""official information"" as to the proposed merger and implications on the company.  Some times, even if no new information is provided, people simply feel better because an effort is made to communicate with them.  People appreciated your open-ness and the frank-ness with which you addressed some of the tougher questions regarding long term employment viability or security.  On the other hand, people read a message into the statements regarding the fact that retention packages will be developed for key individuals.  They read that if they didn't get a retention package they should be looking for a job because they are not key.  Perhaps, bluntly, that is exactly what the message is but now you have many people spending their time trying to figure out the ""definition of key individual.""  People like to feel important (non-core is, for them, non-important) and absent that they worry about every little thing - many of these no one can help or mitigate.  Finally, people took comfort in the comment regarding how long it might take for all to be sold (i.e,. approx. 3 years) and understood and felt better that no fire sale will take place.    

My biggest recommendations are:
-	We need to keep up our communication efforts; people feel important and feel better if folks make an effort to communicate;  Pete and I (and others) need to work on 	communicating further with each of our teams and on motivating them to support the company during these tough times but both you and Jim should continue to 	update people as often as possible.
-	We need to move quickly to identify our key people so that we can be effective about retention efforts;  my own view is that you start with the field; those are your 	most critical individuals because they are running the asset.  
-	We need to continue to deliver the message that the merger is a good thing and that it is not simply another ""life"" bought out by Enron (i.e., many people felt and still 	feel that there is still a chance Enron might make on its own and would pay the breakage fee to get out of the Dynegy deal - this may be more hope than belief but 	that is the case).

A key distinction that I noted in the meeting today was that it sounds as though we will move forward very aggressively to sell all of the EGAS assets.  There is no longer the attitude or position that: if the asset has good earnings and good cashflow, then what's the hurry.  The message today (and forgive me if I mis-read it) was: we will put together a corp. development group that will be focused on selling EGAS assets even if they are performing assets - cash is still king and will continue to be until the merger.

Hope this helps and THANK YOU very much for taking the time to talk to us.

Mariella

Subject:	Confidential - Decision tree on projects

Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting.

There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaza.  In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans.  SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem.  Panama is much less (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year.  Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM.  In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama.  The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from actions taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with private parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a ""mark"" on the company's liquidity position.  

Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence?  The same could go for SECLP and Gaza.

This is simply an overall ""guidance"" question.  Let's take it up during our staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you.

Many thanks, Mariella

Subject:	Wind Company

While I understand that the Wind Co is clearly a ""non-core"" asset for Enron,  I am very concerned about the apparent decision in Houston not to provide short-term liquidity for our operations (I have heard that the wind co is on its own for cash  going forward). While I am probably more eager than anyone to have the Wind Co regain its financial independence, I can not do it overnight and am worried about the potentially devasting impact which a lack of short-term capital will have on our business and, quite directly, the value of this asset to Enron.

 As you know, our lenders on IMI/Clear Sky have refused to fund a construction loan (they will not take Enron equity bridge risk) - this construction loan was the most important piece of our working capital/cash funding for Q4.  AEP and its lenders on IMI/Clear Sky are also expressing serious concern about the Enron warranty guaranty (we will likely have to reserve cash to secure our warranty obligations, further exacerbating our cash position).  FPL and AEP have in essence put on hold their deals with Enron Wind pending some clarity on how Enron's liquidity difficulties may affect Enron Wind.  AEP has gone as far as saying the Enron Wind is probably BK without working capital support from Enron, and are understandably asking why should they be comfortable with our performance risk?  Our European vendors, still mindful of Tacke's bankruptcy in 1997, are extremely concerned about our financial condition.  And a number of our counterparties who owe us money but are also owed money by Enron affiliates are seeking to set-off those obligations.  While I will have better numbers over this weekend, without the IMI/Clear Sky construction loan, I will need between $30-35mm through the end of the year (until the AEP sale closes) in order to meet our working capital needs.  Without that support, I can almost guaranty you I will not be able to sell IMI/Clear Sky to AEP and am worried about our short-term financial survival.  

Stan - this clearly has serious implications for the value of Enron Wind and our sales effort.  I am meeting again with my finance team (such as it is) over the weekend and on Monday morning.  I will set up some time with you on Monday or Tuesday to discuss.  I know there is no desire to support the Wind Co medium to long-term, but a decision to cut us off now could be fatal.   

Adam

Stan,

Since returning to Enron, I have been working in ENA's Upstream Business Unit.  For the past year we have been pursuing infrastructure opportunities in the deepwater GOM.  The infrastructure projects consisted of deepwater pipelines and floating production systems such as spars or tension leg platforms.  Recently, ENA has re-evaluated its business strategy in deepwater and is questioning the amount of exposure ENA should take given its ownership position in Mariner.  ENA may not view offshore infrastructure as a strategic business opportunity for Enron.  

I would like to meet with you to discuss current and future deepwater project developments in the Gulf of Mexico.  These projects may represent a significant opportunity for EOTT.  I have worked with EOTT extensively to determine the best crude oil export option for each projects.  

In addition, if ENA determines that deepwater infrastructure projects are not strategic, I would be interested in your opinion regarding opportunities with ETS for someone with my experience.  I have attached my resume for your convenience.

 << File: KMM Resume Jun2001.doc >> 

Could your administration assistant call and set up a time for the brief meeting?

I was very disappointed to not have any advance warning about the announcement that construction on 41 has been put on hold for financial reasons.

The Gas Logistics team was ""relocated"" off the 41st floor on October 5.  Prior to the move, we had a very efficient, open configuration that let us work together as a unified team.  

After the move, we are located on 3 different floors.   Besides the general impact on team unity, this move also means that our evening staff work alone on separate floors, rather than in a group.  It means fewer individuals to cover customer calls.  It means having more equipment to cover the day to day business.   I have worked hard to calm the team that this arrangement is just temporary and that we will eventually be put back together as a team.

Prior to our move I constantly questioned whether our move was necessary.  I asked about smaller, more practical changes to fit more people on the floor.  And, I specifically asked about whether Enron issues might impact the groups desire to continue to spend $7-$10 million -- even as I reluctantly packed up my boxes.

I hope you can appreciate that the current seating arrangement is a serious issue for my team and one that generates constant questions as my staff meetings.  Finding out  that we moved off of 41 for no reason at an all-employee floor meeting undermines my team's faith in my leadership.

Stan - We would like to invite you and Debbie to our Christmas party December 7 at the Western Heritage Museum in Omaha. We are having a combined ETS/NBP wild blowout. We are planning a social hour at 6:30 with dinner at 7:30 and service awards after dinner. After that the dancing begins, and McGowan starts wearing funny hats.
Mike is inviting Danny and if it works out that you bring the plane up, we would probably ask Shelly, Rod, Phil, etc. to see if any of your or Danny's staff would like to join us also

I had my international team in for business and budget reviews and to discuss what ""non-core"" means since both Dynegy and Enron have labeled them as such.  We need to keep these folks motivated to get us through the sale process.  I couldn't reschedule them since they were heading home tonight.  They are fine and willing to see this through.  Please let Chuck know that I just had a conflict.

Congratulations on a very successful rollout with the Analysts on Monday.  Sorry I couldn't go to Chicago with Chuck but it appeared I would have been a detraction.

Subject:	Indian Mesa Sale - Creditor's Committee

Good news - The creditors' committee is okay with the sale of the project on current price and terms.

Bad news -  The creditors' committee wants all of the net cash to go to the estate (I had proposed that we keep enough of the net cash at EW in order to fund our expected WC needs through sale of the company).  We are now negotiating for a freeze on the net cash (through Jan 7) pending a presentation by Enron and CSFB (next week) as to why it is in the estate's best interest to allow EW to operate as a going concern in order to maximize value to the estate on sale of the business.  Mark is on board for this presentation.

Bottom line - if we do not have access to a significant portion of the net cash from this sale, I will not be able to keep the business going through a Q1 sale.  Bad result for all involved.  

I will give you a further update when we talk this afternoon.

You asked for a time line on securing this quote.  

I have already discussed the general concept with Marsh Mac and a bit of strategy on how we would approach this with AIG.  

Lou,  I need you to give me the data that we have available on these lines.  As I mentioned to you, I want to go to the carrier  with what I have to offer them instead of them dictating to me what they want.   Until I get this I am strictly talking in a vacuum and can get nothing moving forward.  

After that, I would think that I could have a quote from them within 30 days..I will shoot for better than that.  I feel however that this quote/due diligence will be much more intensive on their part  given their experience with EOTT,  I can definitely ask for an answer within a specified time frame.  Is 30 days acceptable? 

 Hope this answers your questions.  If not please let me know.

Stan - 

Phil forwarded (to me) your response (see below) to the e mail he had sent regarding the Robin Border memo. I concur with your thoughts on trust and will continue my efforts in that regard. 

'Thanks for the update.  Doesn't appear as Robin is helping out any.  I am not sure why Dana values his opinions so much on this topic.  Keep working the progress.  The key people you need to make happy are Robert and Dan.  I trust that Mike is developing a effective relationship with them and Dana.  Trust is essential in making this partnership work.'  

I've been meeting with a nunber of the ETS folks that have been working on EOTT issues and assignments, and although we have been working hard, we simply have some additional work to do in the areas of communication, which I will address and facilitate. We meet with the commercial folks on Tuesday after the normal EOTT Staff Meeting regarding the Enhanced Integrity Plan, where we can hopefully move forward. In addition, I will put together a presentation outlining the 2002 EOTT Integrity Plan for presentation the next time the commercial folks meet. It will also include facts of our on-going remediation plan and  hydrotest / pigging efforts for 2001.     

In my opinion, the EOTT operations assignment has been a challenge for ETS. ETS - and Phil in particular - has dedicated tremendous effort to significantly enhance EOTT operations. Few could have tackled the EOTT operational challenges as well as Phil has. Besides the fact that it may not have been a popular decision at EOTT to relinquish control of Operations, he has done an outstanding job in keeping his staff focused on performance with integrity and quality, all the time within a financial framework that adds value to the overall picture of Enron and EOTT. It has not been easy. I am confident you recognize how well he has changed the face of operations in ETS and EOTT as you have changed the face of both organizations overall.

Best wishes for a good Thanksgiving.

Per our earlier discussion, this is a request for permission to use of the company's plane so that Jim and I can attend the ceremony below, which will be used to sign an agreement with the utility, pursuant to which they will acquire the Subic and Butangas power assets.  Our team, lead by Steve Jernigan, will work around the clock between now and that date to paper the transaction.  The documentation will still be subject to board approval.  If things go as planned, we could be talking about proceeds in the range of $100 to $110 million at a purchase price that is in excess of 30% higher than our own fair market valuation for the asset.  Earnings results will depend on tax' position vis a vis the booking of deferred US taxes on the transaction.

Dear Steve,

The Energy Investors' Forum in New York City appears to be a ""by invitation only"" affair hosted by CSFB on Nov. 15 and by Citibank on Nov. 16.

Highlights of Nov. 15
Investors' Forum with Philippine DOE Secretary Vince Perez speaking at 3:30 pm in Norse Suite, 18th Floor, Waldorf Astoria
Signing of MOU's (3 to 4 inclusive of the two agreements with Enron) at 5:10 to 5:20 pm--Ed Delfonso (President of PSALM) and Vince Perez (DOE Secretary and also Vice Chair of NPC) are expected to be the signatories on the agreements with Enron; President Arroyo is likely to be in attendance

Highlight of Nov. 16
Investors' lunch hosted by Citibank probably also in Waldorf Astoria but not yet confirmed

While we are still unsure whether or not we will have the agreements ironed out by Monday/Tuesday next week, the Philippine DOE has requested that we submit the names of Enron individuals that should be invited to the events.  We need to have this list immediately, which I will discuss with you shortly.

Best regards,
Manuel

Stan, thanks for the comments.  With regard to EOTT, we plan to keep the same attention and focus on all of the EOTT initiaitives.  I'm a little bit surprised by your comment that they didn't know because I talked with Dana the day after I announced it at Phil's staff meeting.  Obviously something broke down somewhere and I need to keep that in mind in the future.  

Relative to your second concern, I'd be less than honest with you if I told you that I don't have the same concern.  Phil and I discussed this at some length but since his work on the international side was winding down and Hawkins really didn't have anything for him going forward we thought his measurement background and technical knowledge might be a fit here.  Don and I talked to Lohit at some length about the communications and relationship building required for him to be successful in the job and he felt he could handle it.  I plan to stay on top of it.  If I see the communications and/or relationships that are required for this job breaking down, I plan to deal with them quickly through the performance mangement process.  Hope this answers your questions.

The Editorial Review Board will probably be asked to review the correspondence that will be sent to the FERC.

The Wessex sale process seems to be proceeding well.  So far we have made
presentations to Barclays, RBS, WestLB, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, ENEL
and Candover.  There should be another six or seven early in the new year
with the aim of getting firm bids by about 18 January.

We are trying to kill any media interest although with so many people
involved this is always going to be difficult.  Michael Anderson has been
doing a great job in co-ordinating the process.

Meanwhile, in the real world, the business is going pretty well although we
are running through a very dry period at a time when we would expect to be
achieving groundwater recharge.  We are having to utilise more expensive
river sources to rest the groundwater and provide security for the summer.

Have a good holiday.

I can't wait, but I also remember just how unpredictable Regionals can be so I don't want to get my hopes up about anything.  Of course, my two kids are being little angels which is making me feel pretty good about my chances so we'll see what happens.  Well, I better go do some actual work (although no one is even here yet so I'm not sure what exactly I'm supposed to do this morning), but oh well.  I'll talk to you later.  Have a good day.

I just received a call from David Dehaemers at Kinder, Morgan.  They are interested in buying Transwestern and offered to have Rich call Ken - but I waived that off in order to get a read from you all.

With respect to the merits, if a preferred at the pipe level is being treated as effectively debt by the rating agencies, a sale is roughly equivalent to a preferred with respect to both ratings and liquidity.  In addition, the sale should provide greater proceeds due to lower cost of funds and may have a higher probability of success.  One key issue will be funding the sale at signing or HSR rather than regulatory approval.

I first wanted to test you three, and if supportive, determine the best path upon which to proceed including gaining Dynegy's consent.

Subject:	Wessex Sale

As you know, I have been expressing concern about the need for momentum with
the sale.  I understand we still don't have a bank in place and I know that
at least two of the bidders are beginning to feel that they are being used
simply to encourage others.

We have on the table three serious bids at or around RAB value - which is
better than we might have expected.  I understand RBS are now considering
talking to Barclays to bring them into a single bid which would not be good
for the competitive process.

We need to move quickly for a number of reasons:-

1	Keeping these guys interested.
2	There is an opportunity now to take out the high yield bond.
3	We need to get the deal done well before AEL refinancing is
required.

It seems to me we have three ways forward:-

1	Find an independent bank - there are UK banks such as Close Brothers
who are smaller but do not have any Enron issues.  They would be more than
capable of carrying out the sale process and we could leave the high yield
bonds with SSSB or CSFB.

2	Proceed without a bank - this carries the risk that we won't have a
fairness opinion.

3	Satisfy ourselves that one or maybe a combination of banks can carry
out the process without claims of undue influence.

I propose to arrange the first management presentations on Friday of this
week and Monday and Tuesday of next week because I believe it is essential
that we maintain momentum.  Let's sort out the bank issues before then.

Colin

Hi there.  Well, I got my accounting test back  and it wasn't that great.  I made a B.  I missed almost all my points  on one of the big problems.  I screwed up the formula and used the wrong  number as the denominator which made the whole problem wrong.  I was really  bummed and felt really stupid when she went over it.  My friend Missy sits  behind me and the exact same thing happened to her on the same problem so I  didn't feel so bad after that.  Our prof is going to substitute our lowest  test grade with our final exam grade which she said everyone always does  really well on so I still have an A in the class.  I was still ticked  though.  I know a B isn't bad but when it's because of one problem you  screwed up it's frustrating.  If I hadn't screwed up the problem I would  have had an A.  Other than that, today had been unexciting.  I'll be  home tomorrow night and can't wait!!!  I was thinking of coming over in the  morning on Thanksgiving Day and staying till noon.  Would that be ok?   I think the Saporitos are coming over at noon so I have to be back by  then.  Let me know what your plans are as far as thanksgiving day goes and  if my coming over in the morning is ok.  I love you!!!  Have fun with  Nick (hehehehe - or should I say good luck).  Tell Grandma Bettye hello and  I love her for me.  Talk to you tonight.

Stan

As with you I guess, the week has been dominated by the fall out from the
Enron problems.  We have focused on reassuring suppliers, customers and
employees that Wessex Water will continue to trade as a viable business.

We have agreed a way forward with Mark Muller and Michael Anderson on the
potential sale of Wessex.  The intention is a package deal that involves the
buyer of Wessex first dealing with the Azurix high yield bonds.

Enron/Azurix are appointing a bank to handle the process.  We have three
serious contenders - WestLB, RBS and Barclays.  Due diligence will start at
the end of next week/beginning of the following week.

I will keep you posted.

Colin

I believe they are some of the brightest commercial people at Enron, and in particular have a lot of experience with corporate development, M&A, asset purchases and sales (including international experience).  They are also incredibly hard working people.  

Please let me know if your interested, or feel free to contact them directly.

Rod,
Attached are three cases for Project Armstrong.  I know you're out of the office until Wednesday but I thought if you could respond by Blackberry or phone as to which case we should send to TCPL, I would get that to them before the holiday so they could work on it Thursday and Friday.

*	Case 1 is an 8% distribution growth case (starting with the plan and increasing acquisition activity to deliver 8% growth).  To achieve that our total capex for NBP goes up to an average of just over $400 million per year.
*	Case 2 tracks with our budget case and involves about $200 million in capex per year and results in 2 years of 8% growth and then a flat distribution level for the remaining 3 years.
*	Case 3 utilizes the budget case but eliminates all acquisitions (capex is about $30 - $40 million average per year for maintenance and asset development) and assumes NBPL recontracting occurs at 85% of max rates.  The result is distributions increase to $3.30 in 2002 and stay at that level throughout the 5 year period.

Obviously Case 1 is the most aggressive in terms of valuation among the three.  Please let me know if that is ok to send or do you have something else in mind.  Also I could fax hard copies if you would like...

Given the recent developments related to the DPC project, I would like to

One member of my group, Sandeep Kohli, worked for years for DPC
in Mumbai and has not only good understanding of all the related contracts,
but also excellent relationships with the major stakeholders, partners and regulatory authorities.
He has also excellent analytical skills. His recent project was related to evaluation
of the potential for developing power markets around Maharashtra, to improve
economic viability of the DPC project (Dec 2000 - February 2001) - a presentation
is attached.

Please, feel free to ask Jim Hughes about Sandeep's skills and dedication to the company.

Hi Stan,
 
Given all of the other issues you are, undoubtedly, handling for Enron these days, I wonder if you could do us the big favor of talking to El Paso's chairman (Weiss, spelling?).  Attached you will find an outline of a strategy for a cooperation undertaking between El Paso's power asset in the Dominican Republic (called CEPP, approximately 67 MW of barge mounted diesel engines, also selling power to the CDE, the government owned utility which has had a terrible payment record) and SECLP.  
 
We have tried to work with El Paso's Latin America folks but there seems to be little or no interest in pushing forward an aggressive agenda; at least not with Enron.  If you could find some time just to mention these issues to him and let him know that we are very much interested in working with his team, that would be great.
 
Thank you very much.

Mariella, I cannot get El Paso to comment on this proposal nor give a commitment to anything more than agreeing to work together.  They don't disagree with the concept attached or the fact that we may want to be shut down at the same time to cause the GoDR to address us seriously.  I can't tell if they are not ready to commit or they just want to keep their options open for a while.
 
I believe it would be good to give this to Stan and have him talk to his counterpart at El Paso, acknowledging that the groups are working together to achieve a common goal of realizing the stranded costs.  It might put some pressure on the indecision at the lower ranks.

Subject:	EGS Newsletter

Stan,

With the formation of EGS, as well as all of the recent activity affecting the company, we feel that it is important to initiate an EGS newsletter to keep employees informed and motivated.  The most cost-effective and timely way of doing this is through e-mail, backed up with an intranet version and hard copies (in most cases printed off locally) for those employees who do not have PCs.  The newsletter would supplement other communication channels, such as messages from you, eSpeak, floor meetings, site visits, your periodic meetings and normal management communication.  

We would like to see how much news and interest we have before making a final determination, but would expect this newsletter to go out once or twice a month.  In addition to English, we intend to provide Spanish and Portuguese versions.   We will work to assist local management if they feel that other languages are needed for their operations.

Attached for your review is the proposed text for the first edition.  We believe a message from you and summary of the business units/operations in EGS is the appropriate content for the first edition.  In future editions we would expect to also cover business developments and news of interest to employees.  A template of our proposed design for the newsletter is also attached.  Any comments on the text or concept, as well as your approval to proceed would be greatly appreciated.  Of course, I am available at your convenience if you want to discuss this.

Thank you,

John

Subject:	EWC - Weekly Update/Week Ending 27 April


1.  Aura.
     -  Received revised bid from UBS which Metts describes as ""real.""  UBS
will now commence detailed 6-8 week due diligence on EWC (at Enron's
expense if deal busts).  Confidence re: UBS' ability to execute remains
mixed.
     -  LJM (Fastow) interest continues, but unclear how parallel process
can be run.  Umanoff concerned about conflict when management assists
seller as part of UBS deal but assists buyer as part of LJM deal.
     -  Now that '01 numbers scrubbed, in process of revising '02 financial
projections based on detailed internal review (as of December, 2000, '02
EBITDA projected at approximately $115mm; up from 1CE '01 projection of
$78mm). This is unrealistic; I expect 2002 EBITDA in the $90-95mm range,
showing solid 15-20% EBITDA growth.

2.  M&A Activity.
     -  acquisition of assets of bankrupt Dutch blade manufacturer, Aerpac,
continues; we have closed on several assets and expect final closing in
May.
     -  sale of Greek operating projects to German buyer continues, but
execution uncertain.  Closing targeted for June 30.  Sale of Greek
development company also launched, with 2 parties expressing interest.

3.  2001 Commercial Activity.
     -  US backlog remains firm.  Projected demand continues to exceed our
projected turbine supply.  Key execution issue is confimation of
suitability of 1.5 MW turbine (primarily its gearbox) in more rigorous US
wind regimes.
     -  American Electric Power has provided indicative bid to purchase the
two Texas projects we have under development (Indian Mesa I and Clear Sky);
indicative bid price is attractive.  AEP has requested Enron Corp guaranty
of EWC's turbine warranty, like they have received on previous sales with
EWC.  Enron Corp guaranty is approved internally, but, in light of Aura,
we will continue to bargain for no Enron Corp credit support. Finally, debt
financing expected to close on IMI in May and debt circled on Clear Sky in
June.  Turbine suitability due diligence is key pacing item for debt
closing.
     -  European backlog remains firm, expect for Spanish sales of 750kw
turbine, which remains soft. EWC attended Hannover Fair last week, the
largest industrial trade show in Europe.  Our exhibit was very well
received.  CEO of German competitor, Enercon, approached Umanoff to discuss
IP issues (Enercon is currently barred from US market on patent
infringement grounds).

4.  HR Issues.
     -  US has lost O&M director and 2 key commercial employees have
expressed concerns.  Need to finalize retention program (Umanoff to discuss
with Horton early in week).
     -  Key recruiting initiatives are: GM Spain; head of global
procurement/blade MFG; European GC.  Umanoff would also like to re-visit
hiring US GM/MD, as day-to-day US operations require more detailed
oversight than Umanoff is currently providing; not clear if we can recruit
for this position in the midst of Aura.

Stan - for the future, please let me know whether this is the right level
of focus.  Talk with you soon. Adam

I have gone through the Agreement again and they look fine.  My notes
indicate only the following changes need to be made:

1.  Caron's portion of the inheritance if I die first should be the
lesser of 5% or $3million and she pays the tax due;

2.  The house I own at 9302 Cypresswood Drive together with all

Subject:	Thanksgiving Message to EGS US Employees

Stan,

Below is a Thanksgiving note from you to all EGS US employees.  Please let me know what feedback you have.  John Ambler reviewed and approved this message.  I'd like to get this out to employees on Tuesday, Nov. 20.

Also, I'm on tap with Lou to get an ETS Salutes memo out early next week acknowledging the employees/departments who worked this week on the financing.

Look forward to hearing from you....Gina



With the Thanksgiving Holiday upon us, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.  
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives and who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. 
I know here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and everyone in the organization is working hard.  Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends.   
Happy Thanksgiving.
Stan

Thanks for your note.  Agreed that execution on IMI and II (construction, debt and equity closings) are the key for the Americas.  It looks like we will have slippage for Q2; I am expecting to see European numbers later this morning and will give you a call to discuss on Friday.  We can also discuss the gearbox issues for the US as to which I am a bit more optimistic than my earlier reports.  Adam

Subject:	Update.


It sounds like the due diligence with UBS is going fairly well with no real surprise.  The news is good on Indian Mesa I and II both on the deal with AEP and the financing.  The real target is completion of the project on time.

I am concerned about slippage again on Q2 due to the Greek project slippage and German installations being behind schedule.  I am looking forward to seeing the Q2 numbers very soon.

What is the issue on the L&S gearbox and what is the potential impact on 01 earnings given your statement that if we do not pass the test, it will present significant problems for 01 US sales.

Let's talk by phone this week if possible.

"RE: EGS Newsletter","Lets try it and then try to gauge whether it is accomplishing anything.  I believe our employees are on information overload and putting out another newsletter adds to the overload.  I have always believed that if we have an effective Corporate newsletter we don't need these subsidiary newsletters.  Meaningful information can be included in the corporate newsletter.  At ETS we used to have periodic FYI newsletters that were directed at key topics we needed to cover.

You and I also need to do a budget review.  The cost I am hearing from your group are to big for EGS to support.  I had truly hoped that Gina's group combined with you and perhaps one other person could cover EGS.  Gina's group was covering ETs and EOTT.  I think Adam has a PR person so we need to find out what PR costs are in the Wind company.  Also NBP's has there own PR person.

Please set up a meeting with Cindy and Tracy.

Thanks

Subject:	RE: EGS Newsletter

Since this newsletter will be sent via e-mail, there is little non-employee related expense.  We will be using existing staff and making this additional employee communication part of our assignments.  Translations, graphics, web support and printing should collectively be under $10,000 per year. (If a subsidiary decided to copy/reproduce for their hourly employees, they would have additional costs.)
Initially we would shoot for every three to four weeks, but this could change depending on interest and content.
This would not replace any other newsletters, but it might result in less local writing costs or redundant news in the EGS businesses.  We expect that Enron corp. vehicles like eBiz would draw from the newsletter for some of their content for the broader Enron audience.  This may  help in getting EGS employees to see themselves as part of a team rather than assets for sale.
Most of the information in the newsletter would be original. The 13,000 EGS employees can benefit from hearing from their chairman, occasional recognition and learning about other units' activities.  We plan to efficiently use our resources in developing this material, since the same effort will assist us in our necessary preparations for both external and internal audiences. 
We had not done the final check of the businesses and it was an oversight leaving out Brian Stanley's groups.  We will include them.

Are you comfortable with the responses outlined above?   If so, we would like to proceed, but need to  ensure that the approach in the chairman's letter is acceptable to you.  Your comments, when you have time, would be appreciated.

Subject:	RE: EGS Newsletter

How much does putting out the newsletter cost?  How often are you proposing to put it out?  Does it replace any other newsletters?  Is there any new information in the newsletter or just restatements of what Ken, Mark and Greg have already said?  Need to make sure we have included Brian Stanley's group in what constitutes EGS.  Especially NEPCO.

Subject:	EGS Newsletter

Stan,

With the formation of EGS, as well as all of the recent activity affecting the company, we feel that it is important to initiate an EGS newsletter to keep employees informed and motivated.  The most cost-effective and timely way of doing this is through e-mail, backed up with an intranet version and hard copies (in most cases printed off locally) for those employees who do not have PCs.  The newsletter would supplement other communication channels, such as messages from you, eSpeak, floor meetings, site visits, your periodic meetings and normal management communication.  

We would like to see how much news and interest we have before making a final determination, but would expect this newsletter to go out once or twice a month.  In addition to English, we intend to provide Spanish and Portuguese versions.   We will work to assist local management if they feel that other languages are needed for their operations.

Attached for your review is the proposed text for the first edition.  We believe a message from you and summary of the business units/operations in EGS is the appropriate content for the first edition.  In future editions we would expect to also cover business developments and news of interest to employees.  A template of our proposed design for the newsletter is also attached.  Any comments on the text or concept, as well as your approval to proceed would be greatly appreciated.  Of course, I am available at your convenience if you want to discuss this.

Thank you,

John
