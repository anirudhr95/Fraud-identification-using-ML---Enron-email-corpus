FYI -- I've provided Kevin Meredith with updated EOL descriptions for all ERCOT products.  Kevin will upload any necessary changes and provide Doug Gilbert-Smith with sample products for his review.  

(i'm leaving in just a minute -- my eyes have had all they can take today!)

Frank,

how do you want the power measured for your liquidity matrix? I also want to make sure that the correlations, while independently calced, are accurate.

Let me know,

"ERCOT Market Set-Up","Doug --

Can you please let me know what your thoughts are for ERCOT physical power market entry?  

Do you intend to work through APX (or some other QSE) for QSE services initially or will you wait until UBS Warburg Energy is fully functioning and tested at the ISO?  

UBS Warburg Energy will need to send in ""Initial Information"" to the PUCT to become a Power Marketer in ERCOT (name, affilitates, location, etc.)

I expect we will look to qualify asap but that we can use the apx if need be. I was not looking to trade too much physical up front instead, looking to build positions so that they go to phys delivery around the same time we are set up. There are some significant deals that we require us certified quickly and I do not see that being a problem. 

I will be in in the morning if you want to catch me then. 

Take care,

"RE: UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs","I understand from Smith Day that APX forwarded us today a format of contract relating to their potentially serving as QSE for UBS AG trading.  APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  

As to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (""RECs""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. 

Trading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:  

TXU Energy Trading 
BP Energy Company
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
Aquila Power Corporation
Morgan Stanley capitral Group
Constellation Power Source
FPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.
American Electic Power Service Corporation
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP
Calpine Energy Servicces LP
Dynegy Marketing & Trade
LCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority

along with a couple of incumbent utilities:

San Antonio City Public Service
Reliant HL&P

If you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.

Subject:	UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
	QSE [Portz, David]   N/A until IT platform is ready for UBS to serve as its own QSE 
	LSE [Portz, David]   N/A 
	Wholesale Enabling Agreement [Portz, David]   No ERCOT  involvement 
	Other [Portz, David]   REC Trading Account Agreement  
3.	APX Agreement [Portz, David]   initially
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

> The subgroup of the Congestion Management Working Group (CMWG) which has

"RE: QSE project timeline","Dave:

I just spoke with Mark Patterson at ERCOT (he is Enron's Client rep.)  He will speak with Richard Howard to confirm but he believes that if you only wish to send QSE to QSE trades that a WAN agreement and connection is not necessary.  We would simply send the XML file via the internet using the tool that ERCOT devised for this.

As for item 4 the answer is no.  The portal does not have the capability of attaching a file and sending it to ERCOT but the tool referenced above would have the same function using the digital certificates.  This would save the $10,000 WAN connectivity and test fee as well with ERCOT.

Doug wants a cost associated with being a full service QSE for a generator.  This would mean setting up the WAN for UBS and licensing the ESCA MOS and other tools.  Steve was working on this.  Do we have an estimate?  Off hand Lloyd believes about $750,000.00.  Also we would have to bring in system operations personnel as ERCOT requires 24hr coverage for this.

Subject:	RE: QSE project timeline

As per our discussion.

Item 1.  Quick updates to the project plan

 << File: poston_ercot.mpp >> 
Item 2.  Example of another plan

 << File: Netco_unit_testing.mpp >> 

Item 3.  Question?  Is a thorough WAN setup and site survey required to submit QSE trade schedules
Response:  Based on the reading we have completed so far, it looks like for standard XML template submission, you only need DIGITAL certificates and an internet connect.  The digital certificates are issued by ERCOT and can be installed on the desktop.  I will follow-up with Pat Most to confirm this assumption.  So, in summary the WAN stuff will hopefully not be required.

Item 4.  Confirmation of an assumption
If we cannot complete the communication work required for ERCOT for initial scheduling (we are hoping we can), FSP will still provide an XML file output that can be uploaded through the ERCOT Portal.  Is this correct Smith?

Thanks,  Poston

Subject:	UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
	QSE
	LSE
	Wholesale Enabling Agreement
	Other
3.	APX Agreement?
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

MAXIMUM ANNUAL FEE		No limit	$400,000 	$380,000 	

Thane indicated that we could possibly do a 1 or 2 month contract, thus avoiding ""LD's"" for a NO TERM contract..  He also indicated that the Minimum Annual Fee is really monthly--thus under the No Term scenario, with a 60-day cancellation:  if we were to terminate & begin using our own QSE prior to the 60 day cancellation we'd only be liable for the $20K in ""Liquidated Damages""...$10K monthly minimum * 2 months.  The point is, if we only use 2 months we're not liable for $100K for unused months because of the ""MINIMUM ANNUAL FEE OF $120K.""

We would download APX software to upload/download our daily schedules using APX as our QSE. (no email)

There is also another option where we could be our own QSE but use the APX software to schedule for a lesser fee (which Thane is checking into).  There is a fee for the software per workstation.

"FW: Phy East Pwr LD","Doug -- would you let me (and Leslie) know your thoughts on the below.  The product descriptions Leslie is focussed on are attached, but I supspect we should explore what other product offerings you are hoping to put onto EOL, in the financial realm as well.  --David

Since ERCOT is non-FERC jurisdictional, can we release the ERCOT products prior to UBS obtaining a FERC power marketing license?
 
David, have there been any changes in ERCOT that require us to update the descriptions attached below?

Leslie, 

Please remember to get us any changes to the current long description for the East Power Phy Fwd LD products.  The current description is below.  Also, below is the current location language for the ERCOT North and South products.  Should these be updated as well?  Is it possible for these ERCOT products to be released before the necessary legal licenses have been required for the other east power products?

Thanks, 

Chris

East Power Phy LD product type language: 
A US Power Transaction with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. under which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall purchase a quantity of Firm (LD) energy equal to the Hourly Quantity at the Contract Price in accordance with the terms of the ""Firm (LD)"" definition in Schedule P of the Edison Electric Institute Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement Version 2.1 (modified 4/25/00), including, without limitation, any defined terms contained therein, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the master agreement, if any, that governs this Transaction.  The Contract Price shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Web Site.

ERCOT North Zone 2001: 
The transaction is for delivery or receipt of energy to any points within the North 2001 Zone as finalized pursuant to the action on April 17, 2001 by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (""ERCOT"") Board of Directors, at Seller's daily election. If such North 2001 Zone is superceded by a zone or zones of different boundaries, Seller shall nevertheless be required, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, to deliver the energy to points within the geographical area coextensive with the originally defined North 2001 Zone.  If and when possible for Seller to designate under pertinent ERCOT scheduling practices, any such points shall be connected to the ERCOT Transmission Grid by Transmission Facilities (as such terms are defined in the ERCOT Protocols) operated at or above 138kV.

ERCOT South Zone 2001: 
The transaction is for delivery or receipt of energy to any points within the South 2001 Zone as finalized pursuant to the action on April 17, 2001 by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (""ERCOT"") Board of Directors, at Seller's daily election. If such South 2001 Zone is superceded by a zone or zones of different boundaries, Seller shall nevertheless be required, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, to deliver the energy to points within the geographical area coextensive with the originally defined South 2001 Zone.  If and when possible for Seller to designate under pertinent ERCOT scheduling practices, any such points shall be connected to the ERCOT Transmission Grid by Transmission Facilities (as such terms are defined in the ERCOT Protocols) operated at or above 138kV.

AvWeek: Chinese Downplay Report That Jiang's 767 Was Bugged


By Michael Mecham and David A. Fulghum/Aviation Week & Space Technology

28-Jan-2002 11:06 AM U.S. EST



A month before President George W. Bush is to visit President Jiang Zemin
in Beijing, the Chinese Foreign Ministry is taking a
see-no-evil/speak-no-evil approach to allegations that somebody in the
U.S. bugged a Boeing 767-300ER outfitted last year as a presidential
transport for Jiang.


News of the apparent bugging, which was reported Jan. 18 on Aviation
Week's AviationNow.com, entered the rumor mill in Beijing after routine
tests of the aircraft revealed the devices last October, officials
familiar with the situation said.


But Chinese reluctance to complain kept a lid on it, at least in official
circles. Despite the time lapse since the bugs were reportedly found,
Secretary of State Colin Powell said the Chinese have never raised the
issue and he doesn't expect it to interfere with plans for Bush to visit
China on the 30th anniversary of President Nixon's historic trip that
reopened relations between the two countries after decades of mistrust.


LAST WEEK, CHINESE Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi said the episode
would not affect Sino-U.S. relations. Other than hearing reports, Sun
said, ""I don't know what it is about. The Chinese Foreign Ministry is not
apprised of the specific situation."" White House officials said they don't
discuss such allegations.


It's unclear how the ""bugs"" were uncovered, but various news reports said
that up to 27 transmitters were found, including in Jiang's lavatory, in
the headboard of his bed, and in a Rockwell Collins SAT 906 satellite
communications device. A Rockwell Collins official said a satcom is
buyer-furnished equipment; late last week the company was still checking
what equipment it might have had on board the aircraft. Exactly how
signals might be transmitted also is unclear. The aircraft itself is a
good shield of internal emissions. They could be sent through the
aircraft's satcom system, providing a power source and an antenna were
tapped, but that raises the question of how to mask the transmissions so
that others could not detect them.


The aircraft was part of an order for Delta Air Lines, Boeing's largest
767 operator, and was delivered June 15, 2000, but never put in service.
Instead, on July 7, 2000, Delta informed Boeing that it had sold the
aircraft to state-owned China United Airlines (CUA) in Beijing. The
refurbishment contract was signed Oct. 1, 2000, and was conducted even as
the U.S. and China were at loggerheads over the forced landing of a U.S.
Navy EP-3E signals intelligence aircraft last April. The aircraft left
Texas on Aug. 10, 2001, for China via Hawaii, according to U.S. officials
involved in the project.


CUA contracted with Avitra Aviation Services Ltd. of Singapore to
customize its interior; Avitra, in turn, subcontracted work to Decrane
Corp., Gore Design Completion Ltd. and Dee Howard Aircraft Maintenance Co.
to prepare the aircraft at San Antonio International Airport. Avionics
were installed separately under a Chinese government contract.


In a statement, Gore Design and Dee Howard said the Chinese have not
complained to them. Gore and Avitra officials doubted that any security
breach had occurred while their work was underway.


The guessing game as to who did what extended to China, as well. Analysts
suggested that conservatives in the Chinese military might be behind the
episode as a way to embarrass Jiang or to intimidate whoever succeeds him.
He is due to step down as president and head of the Communist Party this
year, but would stay on as a ""paramount"" leader and remain chairman of the
powerful Central Military Commission.


The aircraft was said to have been kept under round-the-clock security by
Avitra, Howard and Chinese government security, according to U.S.
officials involved in the project. But an official familiar with such
arrangements said that may not mean much. He said security personnel would
have to be expert in all aspects of aircraft systems to even recognize if
listening or transmitting devices were being installed. Second, since
special-purpose outfitting jobs take months to complete, it's easy for
security personnel to lose their vigilance.


Indeed, various news reports said up to 26 Chinese military and civilian
officials have been detained on suspicion of negligence and corruption in
the incident. The references to civilian officials prompted an indignant
response from the Civil Aviation Administration of China that no one from
its China Aviation Supplies Export & Import Corp. subsidiary was involved.
CASC most likely would have been the agency responsible for importing the
aircraft.


AFTER THE EP-3 downing, the strained relations between the two countries
spilled over into commercial aircraft orders as the CAAC held back
approval of the acquisition of Boeing transports.


The ice thawed late last year when CASC bought 30 737s. The CAAC and
Boeing are said to be discussing a larger order. China often announces
large orders when heads of state visit.

I had the same thought last night, as to the QSE agreement, if it is only a month or two until UBS would execute that with ERCOT.  I am hoping that the Enron credit person attending can, if requested, give background on the credit requirements that would be placed on UBS if it became a QSE.  Please let me know the number of attendees when you find out so that we can provide adequate copies for those needing them.  Thanks. -- David

After thinking about this last night, I would still like to bring to the meeting today at 1pm all the documents that would be necessary for UBS to be ""fully"" functioning so that we can get this data in front of the UBS legal group.

Subject:	RE: UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

I understand from Smith Day that APX forwarded us today a format of contract relating to their potentially serving as QSE for UBS AG trading.  APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  

As to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (""RECs""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. 

Trading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:  

TXU Energy Trading 
BP Energy Company
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
Aquila Power Corporation
Morgan Stanley capitral Group
Constellation Power Source
FPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.
American Electic Power Service Corporation
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP
Calpine Energy Servicces LP
Dynegy Marketing & Trade
LCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority

along with a couple of incumbent utilities:

San Antonio City Public Service
Reliant HL&P

If you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.

Subject:	UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
	QSE [Portz, David]   N/A until IT platform is ready for UBS to serve as its own QSE 
	LSE [Portz, David]   N/A 
	Wholesale Enabling Agreement [Portz, David]   No ERCOT  involvement 
	Other [Portz, David]   REC Trading Account Agreement  
3.	APX Agreement [Portz, David]   initially
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

"Re: Change Control Conference Call 2/8/02","
Susan, I have not had a chance  to look at what we have for this week, but unless we have something that is pressing, I recommend that we postpone the call until next week.

Due to a family emergency, I will not be able to facilitate the Change
Control Conference Call this Friday, 2/8/02.
We have two options:
1. Cancel the call until next week.
2. Someone else facilitate...  if you choose this option, I will rely on
Kyle Patricks excellent notes to get the logs and everything
updated.
The log will be a week delayed in getting updated, however, I will make
this a priority when I return next week.
I will be available by Cell Phone.
Thank You,

"Online Trading Simulation Feb 7th","Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

Subject:	RE: UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

I understand from Smith Day that APX forwarded us today a format of contract relating to their potentially serving as QSE for UBS AG trading.  APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  

As to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (""RECs""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. 

Trading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:  

TXU Energy Trading 
BP Energy Company
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
Aquila Power Corporation
Morgan Stanley capitral Group
Constellation Power Source
FPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.
American Electic Power Service Corporation
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP
Calpine Energy Servicces LP
Dynegy Marketing & Trade
LCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority

along with a couple of incumbent utilities:

San Antonio City Public Service
Reliant HL&P

If you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.

Subject:	UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
	QSE [Portz, David]   N/A until IT platform is ready for UBS to serve as its own QSE 
	LSE [Portz, David]   N/A 
	Wholesale Enabling Agreement [Portz, David]   No ERCOT  involvement 
	Other [Portz, David]   REC Trading Account Agreement  
3.	APX Agreement [Portz, David]   initially
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

"Online Trading Simulation","We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

We need to have everything in 30 days.  I know that.

The question is given everything else - FERC MBR, gas pipelines, PJM, etc. - isn't it better to move into ERCOT at the wholesale level and then come back after getting the rest of the market moving along?

From a resource standpoint, I need to understand how to get PUCT counsel for UBS to start the REP process anyway.

"RE: qse","15 days prior to scheduling, the QSE must have the registration form submitted to ERCOT.
 
The real critical path is the QSE testing.
QSE testing which is dependent on the test flights. It is unclear to me from the website where that resides. Smith may already know. I will follow up with the testers.  

We can start trading as soon as we can get trading contracts in place with other marketers.  But we cannot schedule.  However, we can use another QSE of course.

Lance,
You are correct. I had corrected the idevs that TXU had sent to leave
everything in area 51, but the old data was not being extracted
properly. Delete the raws that you had previously downloaded. They will
have extra busses and lines due to the error. TXU has a process to put
their data into the old areas for their internal use.

 I fixed the idevs to remove the old data and have sent them to our IT
department along with the new raw data (even included the line upratings
from TXU for the sum, fal, and win cases). The summer raw data is
attached.

have a good thanksgiving,

Presto has asked me to be the contact to Allan Stewart at PIRA with regard to setting up an arrangement for their consulting services.  I'm currently having information-gathering discussions over services and fees for both gas and power, in both the east and west.  In order to fully incorporate everyone's needs into our arrangement with PIRA, I'll be contacting you this week to gather requests.  Or, if you know what you need, please just reply to me with the specific information.

Subject:	UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
	QSE
	LSE
	Wholesale Enabling Agreement
	Other
3.	APX Agreement?
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

"RE: ERCOT Registration Requirements","Charles:

EPMI has established an ERCOT LSE account (agreement) on its own and separate from EES's.  There has been zero activity on the account.  As for the IT issues, we contracted with a company called ESG to facilitate all communication (software, etc) for the LSE account.  The ESG contract is assignable and the people at ESG are eager for that to happen.

Charles,

I think that we are better off just conveying the clean LSE over to NETCO and then registering as an REP in the event we need to. The QSE needs to be re done as the last one is messy.

This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.

Enron Benefit Plans 
Summary Annual Report    

The basic financial and insurance information on the back of this page, as well as the material below, provide a Summary Annual Report for the Enron Benefit Plans.  The annual report for each plan has been filed with the Internal Revenue Service, as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.


Your Rights to Additional Information

You have the right to receive, upon request, a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any plan.  For insured plans, insurance information (including any sales commissions paid by insurance carriers) is shown in the annual reports.

To obtain a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any plan, write or call:

Enron Corp Shareholder Relations
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX  77002-7311

(713) 853-6161

You also have the right to receive from the plan administrator, on request and at no charge, a statement of the assets and liabilities of the plan and accompanying notes, or a statement of income and expenses of the plan and accompanying notes, or both.  If you request a copy of the full annual report from the plan administrator, these two statements and accompanying notes will be included as part of that report.

You also have the legally protected right to examine the annual report at the main office of the plan (Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX  77002-7311) and at the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., or to obtain a copy from the U.S. Department of Labor upon payment of copying costs.

"Online Launch Plan Update","With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

Subject: Invitation to a web seminar on TCRs


ERCOT will be conducting a web seminar on the Transmission Congestion Right (TCR) program which will be implemented in conjunction with the direct assignments of congestion costs beginning February 15th, 2002. TCRs function as financial hedges against marginal costs associated with Zonal Congestion. TCRs are a financial right on a specified directional Commercially Significant Constraint (CSC) for a particular date and hour that entitles the TCR holder to receive remuneration from ERCOT for congestion costs. The TCR Program is open to any entity that qualifies as a TCR Account Holder, except for Transmission and Distribution Service Providers. Bidding on the first TCR auction is scheduled to start on January 30, 2002. The first auction for the TCR Program will be for 100% of the TCRs from February 15 - 28, 2002. The notice for the February auction will be posted on ERCOT's website by January 25, 2002. 
 
Training on TCRs was conducted at the ERCOT facilities in Austin during the week of January 7th. This web seminar was arranged to meet requests from participants to make the same material available to for those who were not able to come to Austin.  Please follow the instructions below to attend the web seminar at the specified date and time. There are a limited number of lines available for the conference call. Your cooperation in sharing one phone line with a speakerphone for multiple attendees from the same entity is greatly appreciated. 
 
The web seminar will begin with an introduction to TCRs and their use in the ERCOT market. The presentation will be followed by overview of the process to register and participate in the ERCOT TCR auction process, financial security requirements and settlement implications of TCRs. A follow up demonstration of the website and software that will be used to administer the auction is scheduled for Wednesday, January 23, 2002 from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. You will receive a separate e-mail notification on this web seminar. 
 
If you have further questions, please call your ERCOT client representative or call the general client relations number at (512) 248-3900.

Hello Everyone,

The Oracle DBA team would like request NetCo production database downtime starting tomorrow Thursday 01/31/2002 at

Attached is the summary of the reorg work and the estimated downtime.  All NetCo production databases will be ready
no later than Friday 02/01/2002 at 7am if not earlier.

 
Please response with your approval by COB today.  If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me or your dbas.

Thanks,
Mable

"RE: Power curves validation","I agree with the delegation except for Chris Dorland.   Tim Belden needs to determine who validates the West Power curves.   With respect to vol curves, Steve Wang and Rob Stalford need to validate.
 
What time period are we validating?

"Access Card Information","Subject: Access Card Information

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

"ALERT!!","
There will be a UBSWE Migration TONIGHT....please make sure that you LOG OFF before you leave today.  

Monday morning, (2/4/02), you will logon with your Enron NT Account and Password.  You will immediately be forced to change your password (following Enron rules) and your NT ID will stay the same.  Once you've changed your password, and logged off AGAIN, you will see the UBS Warburg Energy Screen....email will not be affected until day one.

Starting Monday, you will receive emails from IT support to explain the HOW TO's for your data that YOU  will need to begin transferring over to UBS.  All material will need to be in compliance with UBS standards and NO documents or emails are to be deleted.  In Outlook the following information will be transferred over by IT: Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, and Notes.  Emails (Inbox, Sent Items and Deleted Items) and folder structure will NOT be migrated.

ALL data MUST be migrated PRIOR to day one (estimated to be 02/08/02 ), as access to Enron data will be disabled Day 1.

Thanks for your immediate help in this matter.

Mike , 
 
If there are any power traders that did not sign on with UBS. Please pass this on . 
 
Progress Energy in North Carolina is embarking upon a major expansion of it's trading floor . They have hired an excellent SVP and are offering excellent growth opportunities for power traders . Traders with 2-4 years experience can move up to desk heads . Desk heads can move into more senior management roles . Let me know if you have any interest . Any recommendation you might have would be greatly appreciated .

"RE: UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs","I had the same thought last night, as to the QSE agreement, if it is only a month or two until UBS would execute that with ERCOT.  I am hoping that the Enron credit person attending can, if requested, give background on the credit requirements that would be placed on UBS if it became a QSE.  Please let me know the number of attendees when you find out so that we can provide adequate copies for those needing them.  Thanks. -- David

Subject:	RE: UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

I understand from Smith Day that APX forwarded us today a format of contract relating to their potentially serving as QSE for UBS AG trading.  APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  

As to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits (""RECs""), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. 

Trading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:  

TXU Energy Trading 
BP Energy Company
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
Aquila Power Corporation
Morgan Stanley capitral Group
Constellation Power Source
FPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.
American Electic Power Service Corporation
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP
Calpine Energy Servicces LP
Dynegy Marketing & Trade
LCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority

along with a couple of incumbent utilities:

San Antonio City Public Service
Reliant HL&P

If you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.

Subject:	UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
	QSE [Portz, David]   N/A until IT platform is ready for UBS to serve as its own QSE 
	LSE [Portz, David]   N/A 
	Wholesale Enabling Agreement [Portz, David]   No ERCOT  involvement 
	Other [Portz, David]   REC Trading Account Agreement  
3.	APX Agreement [Portz, David]   initially
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

Due to a family emergency, I will not be able to facilitate the Change

We have two options:
1. Cancel the call until next week.
2. Someone else facilitate...  if you choose this option, I will rely on
Kyle Patricks excellent notes to get the logs and everything
updated.

The log will be a week delayed in getting updated, however, I will make
this a priority when I return next week.
I will be available by Cell Phone.

The estate has been working with traders in order to validate curves.    We are also talking with brokers and reviewing Megawatt Daily archives.
Can I get some curve information from the Ercot team?   

  I have three specific dates to verify:  11/30, 12/3 and 12/30.
We are validating the marks for the daily, balmo, the prompt month and the cals.on the above mentioned dates.

Do you have this information?

I have talked to Peggy at APB.  She is willing to pass on info on the dailies,  but the historical data is something they want us to pay for.  I dont really need help with the daily stuff,  just the dates listed above.

I would appreciate any help that you can give,

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

"FW: UBS Trade Products","Please complete Hayden's form for your respective regions.  

Keep in mind that this could act as potential position limit set forth by UBS so be careful in completing this form.   In addition, UBS has a liquidity reserve used to adjust curves when marking P&L.    The ""liquidity reserve"" accounts for the fact you can't liquidate at the mid and with big positions you probably can't even liquidate at the bid (offer).

Thanks.

My apologies if this has been done, but I'm in process of assembling list of products that UBS will be trading.  If this list has been compiled, please direct it to me.  

I'm interested in getting the greatest granularity possible breaking it out by VaR portfolio name, trader, trading book, commodity, instrument, location, tenor, relative liquidity for each instrument expressed in contract/day (i.e. could impact holding period for VAR) and best risk mitigator.  (Regarding best risk mitigator, I'm not looking for liquidating position comments, but rather best hedge given curve location.)  This will help in directing correlation efforts for VAR.  See attached spreadsheet for suggested format.

"FW: Deal nos.: 785477.01, 783755.01 & 783741.01","David,
I havent spoken to you for awhile.    I hope that everything is going as well as can be.   
Teco has contacted me and asked whether we were going to honor the call options that they bought from us for cal 2002.
These options are in the money for us and I am sure that the estate would like to honor these agreements.

If Teco is asking,  I am guessing that they did not take the proper steps to terminate these agreements.

Paula Castoro listed  below the Enpower #'s for these three options,  but I can give you an unofficial detail of the  contracts:

1.  150 mw's @ $50
2. 50 mw's @ $50
3.  50 mw's @ $40

The premiums paid are unimportant,  but I have them if you need them.

Teco is looking for an answer ( from the estate) on this issue.

Can you give me a call on this?

Thanks,
JMF

John, I know we've played telephone tag quite a bit, thought I would attempt e-mail.  Called this morning before you were in.

Jerry Brown would like to know the status of the above call options in light of the recent acquisition by UBS.  Are you the individual that can provide some clarifications for us??

If so:

Will Enron be honoring these calls??

Have these been assigned to any other counterparty?

If not, would you kindly refer us to the appropriate person??

Thanks in advance.

We have 7 change controls to review this week and 10 questions to address.
If we wait until next week, I'd be concerned we will not have enough time

Due to a family emergency, I will not be able to facilitate the Change

We have two options:
1. Cancel the call until next week.
2. Someone else facilitate...  if you choose this option, I will rely on
Kyle Patricks excellent notes to get the logs and everything
updated.

The log will be a week delayed in getting updated, however, I will make
this a priority when I return next week.
I will be available by Cell Phone.

"UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs","UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
	QSE
	LSE
	Wholesale Enabling Agreement
	Other
3.	APX Agreement?
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

Subject: RE: FW: UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs


We need to have everything in 30 days.  I know that.

The question is given everything else - FERC MBR, gas pipelines, PJM, etc. - isn't it better to move into ERCOT at the wholesale level and then come back after getting the rest of the market moving along?

From a resource standpoint, I need to understand how to get PUCT counsel for UBS to start the REP process anyway.

"Ken Lay Resigns from Board","Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.""

He added, ""My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board.""

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"NETCO Employees at Enron","
As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

I found that doc with the mistake in the ISA14 (Interchange Acknowledgement request) data item? that I referred to in the last RMS meeting:
 
http://www.ercot.com/texaschoiceprogram/conversion.htm
 
http://www.ercot.com/texaschoiceprogram/documentation/conversion/ISA_IEA.doc
 
Texas SETmight not own this document? so we need to decide who will be responsible for it.
 
Also this doc (on the same page) will need updating by the TDTWG:

"FW: Additional Information and Answers--APX","Guys,

This is different than my previous conversation with Thane....In my previous conversation, Thane indicated that we could do a 2 month contract (for example) and not have to pay the ""LDs"" for 60 days.  Point 2 indicates we WILL have to pay $20K ($10K monthly minimum * 2) if we cancel prior to 60 days' notice.

Subject:	Additional Information and Answers

Jeff here is some additional information.

1)  Inside the APX QSE we offer a ""short"" facility/ or ""long"" facility that
allows you want to take a position up to 50 MW a zone.  This is our way of
allowing our clients two work within the balance schedule requirement in
ERCOT.

2)   For the no-term, there is a 60 day termination policy that cannot be
waived.  The short of it is that if you want service for only thirty days,
you would need to pay the monthly minimum for two month ($20,000) plus
whatever volumetric that you incurred while you were using the service.

3)  For the standard service there are 10 logins.  Additional logins are
$150 per login.

4)  For the ASP service, where your are your own QSE and we provide the
application and support, the minimum term is one year.  I have attached a
pricing sheet for the service.  Note that it compares the pricing for the
QSE service, one-year term ASP service without operations and one-year term
with operations.

Attached is the most recent version of the RMS 2002 planning calendar.  Thanks to all the working group chairs that  provided their standing working group meeting dates.  Working group chairs and ad hoc working chairs, should provide Larry Grimm and myself of any additions/changes to the calendar.  We are attempting for the first time, to have a planning calendar of the key system scheduled dates, standing meeting dates and other general RMS dates as the members wish.  The only dates that are not on the calendar are the ad hoc conference calls/meetings that do occur on a short notice basis. 
Larry Grimm will coordinate with the appropriate ERCOT resource to place this in RMS' Key Document folder on the ERCOT website.

"RE: Final ERCOT Physical Hourly Firm LD Definition","Liz -- I've been unable to discuss this with Doug, as he's been out of the office. I'm not even sure if he's terribly interested in this product being promulgated -- the UBSWenergy ERCOT products he will first offer are confined to specific zones.  This product definition would presumably be used to support a ""Seller's  choice"" ERCOT-wide product spanning the four current zones, and the Market Clearing Price (""MCP"") applicable would be in that zone the Seller specified day-ahead. (That is, there are several moving parts to this.) The denomination 'Hourly Firm' was also a matter I wished to explore with him.  Attached is a markup with my thoughts on the draft product, and this morning I'm going to talk to some other folks who might have a read on the operation of the MCP in relation to the LDs calcualtion.  Please note that if one specifies that the MCP is the cap on the Replacement Price, then a presumption is being made that no additional costs are being incurred in purchasing substitute product.  I think this is an acceptable assumption but Doug may think different.   The corrections on the attachment include some intended merely to use the defined terms actually stated in the Protocols.  The changes in the second paragraph are intended to reverse any implication that the settlement on LDs would be held open a month or even 6 months until a final MCP value is identified by ERCOT -- I'd confine the window for recalculation to one month. --DP

"Re: premise address changes","
Shelley, the market left the 814_PC transaction (Maintain customer Information request) in place so that the CR could notify the TDSP when changes like the one you mention were necessary.  It is a point to point transaction from the CR to the TDSP.

Is there a standard process for each TDSP on how CR's should handle notifying a TDSP if they are aware that a premise address needs to be changed? 
Couple of examples below. 
A customer is notified by the post office that the post office is changing their premise address and they call their CR to notify them in order to recieve their bill correctly. 
CR receives information from return mail processing, etc, that a premise address should be changed.   
The 814_20 is for communications from the TDSP to Ercot to the CR, but does not provide for communication back the other way.  Should the customer be directed to the TDSP phone centers or what is the best means to communicate these change requests?

"YOU HAVE 48 HOURS","This is not a circular and you will not get another chance.  This deals with migration to new systems and you need to migrate your own information or applications in the next day.  Remember do not delete anything and data to be transferred must comply (see attachments below).

The policy must be complied by Thursday.  Please ensure that everyone in your group has moved everything which is in compliance with the policy.  We will not be delaying close or restart for people not having completed their own migrations.

Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply (eg Dana - please cover Kevin's migration requirements)

Still, Palmisano, the operations whiz whom Gerstner has long depended on, faces daunting challenges. PCs, disk drives, and chips are problems. Consulting is slowing.
