Subject:	RE: Ohio Label

We will be serving physical in CG&E territory beginning in Feb. 2002 (this was jut pushed back from Dec. 2001).  Origination will begin preselling beginning this week.  Therefore, on the Disclosure Label, which we would present to customers along with contracts between now and Feb., are we ok with stating ""Unknown Purchases"" and then change that once we're not buying on the spot market?

Thanks

Heather,

To the best of my knowledge the only customers in Ohio where physical delivery ""CURRENTLY"" takes place is First Energy (MSG PRODUCT ONLY) and the First Energy utilities should be directly providing the Disclosure Labels or provide load serving entities with the information necessary to complete the Disclosure Labels.  Physical delivery of power, other than MSG PRODUCT, may occur between November 2001 and March 2002; in either event Disclosure Labels need to be submitted to customers with the initial contracts and not again until immediately prior to physical delivery of power.

In all likelihood, spot purchases of power, rather than specific purchases of power, will occur therefore the Disclosure Label ""can only"" contain Unknown Purchases, as described by Stacey Bolton.  

Heather, I think that the three of us (you, Stacey and myself) need to discuss proper procedures regarding Disclosure Labels.

Richard

We are not delivering any power, other than Market Support Generation (MSG), which is provided by the First Energy utility companies.  It should either be the utilities that provide disclosure label information for our label we have to default to ""Unknown Purchases"" or whatever else is allowed/required by the Ohio PUC's.

Based on your request I have taken the opportunity to modify your Renewable Product Description, see attached.  I hope that your are not offended by the quantity of modifications.  Actually, the PJM region is located within the ""MAAC"" region and not ""MAAP"".  I would also like to see a product for each region that represents (i) 50% wind (ii) 50% wind 50% biomass.  In addition, we could have two sets of prices (i) utilizing new renewables and (ii) utilizing existing renewables.

"Out-of-Merit","From time to time there have been discussions in the TIE list criticizing
Con Edison for its involvement in out-of-merit actions, implying that it is
inappropriate for Con Edison control room operators to make such requests.
In its recent order on the Revised Local Mitigation Measures, FERC, in
response to allegations made by Orion, ordered the NYISO to take
responsibility for out-of-merit.

The Con Edison system has the world's most concentrated use of energy for
residential and commercial purposes. It is also a highly
transmission-constrained area where transfer limitations under normal and
second contingency conditions require certain minimum generation levels
within specific load pockets to assure reliability under existing
reliability rules. One of the main functions of the Con Edison control
center is to be vigilant of system conditions at all times and prevent the
system from reaching an unreliable operating state. When such conditions are
imminent, the Con Edison operator so advises the NYISO. Some parties have
said that Con Edison operators should never make out-of-merit requests. Con
Edison operators would be acting irresponsibly if they were to detect an
imminent unreliable operating condition and just sit back and not inform the
NYISO of the potential danger. Con Edison operators have been trained to
focus on operating the New York City system. The NYISO operators have a much
wider state-wide focus. It is entirely appropriate for both a transmission
owner (TO) and NYISO operators to work cooperatively in maintaining
reliability with the clear understanding that under the FERC-approved
tariff, it is the NYISO that has sole responsibility for reliability. I
would like to clarify that all involvement by Con Edison operators in
out-of-merit actions are based on the following  FERC-approved process in
which the NYISO, and not the TO operator, has sole responsibility for these
actions.

	The NYISO FERC Electric Tariff, Section 5.4,  Operations Under
Adverse Conditions states in essence that:
		*	The NYISO shall operate the system in accordance
with Reliability Rules, including local rules
		*	The NYISO will do this, among other measures, by
adjusting generator output levels
		*	The NYISO has sole responsibility for declaring that
Adverse Conditions are imminent
		*	Activation of these actions shall involve a two-step
process
			1.	The TO involved will advise the NYISO that
an Adverse Condition is imminent and recommend action
			2.	The NYISO activates the appropriate
procedures
		*	Records of the activation of such procedures shall
be maintained by both the TO and the NYISO

Having stated the above, let me also say that Con Edison has been working
with NYISO operations to minimize the occurrences of conditions that require
Con Edison operators to request actions that result in OOM operations. Con
Edison supports current efforts by the NYISO to manage load pocket
reliability events in a way that SCD can be used to maintain reliability
with in-merit generation.

In effect, the FERC recent order does not require any change from present
practice which is, and has always been, in compliance with Section 5.4 of
the NYISO FERC Electric Tariff, and in compliance with FERC's recent order:
the NYISO is solely responsible for out-of-merit actions.

"NYISO - Software Release - October 30, 2001","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants,

The following software updates will become active on October 30, 2001.

The NYISO web infrastructure will be enhanced through the
implementation of BEA's WebLogic product. The new application
server will be the platform utilized by the MIS to provide
bidding and scheduling capability to Internet customers. The
new software replaces the NetDynamics product, will provide
the same functionality, and will be a more robust and reliable
development platform for future enhancements.

Enhancements will be made to the software that generates the
Pre-MGF (Master Generator File) file used by transmission owners
in the event of a Backup Dispatch System (BDS) activation. The
enhancements will ensure more accurate operation of the BDS system.

The NYISO web page will be modified to add a ticker function
that displays the real-time load information.

Multiple preliminary software changes will be made to the MIS,
SPIDER, and BAS systems in preparation for the activation of
Virtual Bidding in the NYISO energy markets on November 1, 2001.
Activation of Virtual Bidding is pending approval by the FERC.


If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
representatve
or the Help Desk at 518-356-6060.

Regards,

Customer Relations

Berney,

Attached is the information provided to me by Bill Hatch regarding the COGEN and DSM deals under the GSA (General Services Administration) contract.  When you have a chance to look over then we can speak to Ozzie Pagan about.

Subject:	VAMC Cogen and GSA Commodity Deal

Richard,

In response to your question re: how the VA cogen deal affects the supply contract with the GSA, I have prepared the attached analysis.  Part I focuses on the cogen deal; part II shows the affect of a new DSM project I'm trying to close by end of December.  Please note that this analysis is a back of the envelop analysis that gives you a logic and scope which can now be fine tuned by the appropriate analyst group.

The net result is that the existing cogen deal and the proposed new energy deal provides the EES commodity desk 67mm kWh it can market as Negawatts.  Based upon assumptions from Enron On Line, the market value of these negawatts is $1.5mm.  EFS will be happy to discuss with the desk how we can share this benefit.

Bill

Food for Thought.... 








 After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which 
killed six and injured 1,000, President Clinton 
promised that those responsible would be hunted 
down and punished.    
 After the 1995 bombing in Saudi Arabia, which 
killed five US military personnel, Clinton promised 
that those responsible would be hunted down and 
punished.    
 After the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi 
Arabia, which killed 19 and injured 200 US military 
personnel, Clinton promised that those responsible 
would be hunted down and punished. 
 After the 1998 bombing of US embassies in Africa, 
which killed 224 and injured 5,000, Clinton promised 
that those responsible would be hunted down and 
punished.    
 After the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, which 
killed 17 and injured 39 US sailors, Clinton promised 
that those responsible would be hunted down and 
punished. 
 Maybe if Clinton had kept his promise, an estimated 
7,000 people would be alive today. 

This question was raised on a Philly radio call-in 
show. Without casting stones, it is a legitimate 
question. 
There are two men, both extremely wealthy.  One 
develops relatively cheap software and gives hundreds 
of millions of dollars to charity. The other sponsors 
terrorism. 
That being the case, why is it that the US 
government has spent more money chasing down 
Bill Gates over the past ten years than Osama bin 
Laden?

Sr. Network Administrator

Hey Everybody,

Place the contents of your wallet on a photocopy machine and copy both
sides of each license, credit card, etc. You will know what you had in
your wallet and all of the account numbers and phone numbers to call and
cancel in case it gets lost or worse yet, stolen. Keep the photocopy in
a safe place.

I pass this along, for your information, in case you hadn't thought of
it. We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed us in
your name, address, SS#, credit, etc. Unfortunately (the author of this
piece who happens to be an attorney) had firsthand knowledge, because
my wallet was stolen last month and within a week the thieve(s) ordered
an expensive monthly cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit card,
had a credit line approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN
number from DMV to change my driving record information online, and
more.

But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this
happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel
your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free
numbers and your card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those

where you can find the easily. File a police report immediately in the
jurisdiction where it was stolen, this proves to credit providers you
were diligent, and is a first step toward an investigation (if there
ever is one).

But here's what is perhaps most important:  (I never ever thought to do
this).  Call the three national credit reporting organizations
immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and SS#.  I had never
heard of doing that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an
application for credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert
means any company that checks your credit knows your information was
stolen and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit. By

the time I was advised to do this almost 2 weeks after the theft, all
the damage had been done. There are records of all the credit checks
initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about before
placing the alert. Since then, no additional damage has been done, and
the thieves threw my wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). It
seems to have stopped them in their tracks.

The numbers are:
Equifax: 1-800-525-6285
Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742
Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289
Social Security Administration (fraud line): 1-800-269-0271

Do think about passing this information along. It could really help
someone.

"ERCOT TCR Auction Notice","ERCOT is making final preparations to begin conducting Transmission
Congestion Right (TCR) auctions which will be implemented in preparation
for direct assignments of congestion costs beginning on February 15th,
2002.  TCRs function as financial hedges against marginal costs
associated with Zonal Congestion. TCRs are a financial right on a

particular date and hour that entitles the holder of record to receive
remuneration from ERCOT for congestion costs on that CSC for that time
and date. 
The TCR Program is open to any entity that qualifies as a TCR Account
Holder, except for Transmission and Distribution Service Providers
(TDSPs). TCR Account Holders must complete the Registration, and Credit
Application forms located on ERCOT's website:

The first auction for the TCR Program will be for 100% of the TCRs from
February 15 - 28, 2002. Bidding on the first TCR auction is scheduled to
start on January 30, 2002.   
Bidding on the annual auction which will be for 60% of the TCRs from
March 1, 2002 to December 31, 2002 is scheduled to start on February
7th. The remaining 40% of the TCRs for March 1, 2002 to December 31,
2002 will be conducted at monthly auctions during the upcoming months.
The notices for the annual action and the February monthly auction are

Enron under fire from analysts over SEC probe
By Sheila McNulty in Houston, John Labate in New York and Julie Earle in New York
Published: October 22 2001 12:33 | Last Updated: October 23 2001 17:35
 

 
Enron, the US energy giant, on Tuesday attempted to console angry analysts who were questioning the company over its investments and financial disclosures.

Analysts on a conference call questioned Ken Lay, chief executive, and the company's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow over assets, repayment of debt and discipline in relation to investment decisions.

Mr Lay refused to answer some questions related to the sale of the company's failed water investments, and told an analyst his question time was up. ""I know you want to drag the stock price down and you've done a good job of that. Let's move on. Next question.""

Mr Lay told the conference call that Enron, which has been asked to provide information to the Securities and Exchange Commission over transactions, would not be downgraded to below investment grade.

""We don't think there is any chance of that. I re-emphasise we are committed to maintaining our ratings,"" he said. 


Mr Lay also said he was very concerned that Mr Fastow's character and the company's integrity had been ""loosely thrown about"" in recent days.

Enron held the conference call to address ""investor concerns"" after it announced the SEC had requested it voluntarily provide information ""regarding certain related party transactions"". It is understood that there were only 300 lines into the conferenc call and these were tied up early making it difficult to access.

The call followed a rapid sell-down in the stock, in reaction to Enron's surprise revelation last week of a $1.2bn charge to equity to eliminate the dilutive effects of closing one of its controversial financing vehicles. 

In releasing the SEC call for more detailed information, Enron hopes to counter growing criticism that it should be more transparent. ""We welcome this request,"" said Mr Lay. ""We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest."" 

The SEC probe into Enron's financial dealings is an informal one at this stage, according to the company, and the request for documents is voluntary. However, SEC probes often begin lightly as investigators gather information on an issue. 

Such probes, including the one the currently involves Enron, could turn into a formal investigation at any time. Should that happen, regulators would be armed with subpoena power and could demand certain documents be handed over. The SEC would not confirm or deny the existence of the Enron probe. 

Mr Lay did not detail which transactions the SEC was reviewing, though analysts believe they relate to Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, who has been reported to have, until recently, run a limited partnership that bought assets valued at hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron. 

Analysts say the transactions themselves, while controversial because of Mr Fastow's links to the company, have been disclosed repeatedly. What they wonder is how Enron valued the assets involved. 

Some analysts said Mr Lay personally had called on Monday to assure them the SEC request was nothing to worry about and ""a matter of procedure."" 

The news comes at an awkward time for Mr Lay, who had pledged more disclosure just two months ago, when he resumed the duties of chief executive officer, following the departure of Jeffrey Skilling after just six months on the job. 

Enron's third-quarter results, which were released last week, included details of the company's sprawling businesses that analysts had sought for some time. Mr Lay said then that analysts ""are encouraged by what we we're doing."" But he did not think that would end criticisms of Enron, adding, ""Probably, they'll never get everything they want.""

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

A CONFLICT WITH THE EMC COMMITTEE MEETING


After reviewing the items that were scheduled for discussion at the January 18,

material to warrant an entire meeting. Further, it was brought to the attention
of the Secretary that there were FERC plenary sessions concerning the Northeast

The next meeting of the RAA-RC is scheduled for February 15, 2002 at the Wyndham

"Global Green USA Important Update","
GLOBAL GREEN USA AND KEY STAKEHOLDERS JOINTLY RELEASE BASELINE STUDY OF BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECOVERY PROGRAMS

For Immediate Release -

ATLANTA, January 16, 2002 - A unique coalition of industry, governmental agencies and environmental organizations has released a study that, for the first time, provides baseline statistics on the costs, benefits and effectiveness of programs to recover discarded beverage containers for recycling. Understanding Beverage Container Recycling: A Value Chain Assessment is the final report of the Multi-Stakeholder Recovery Project, Stage One. Businesses and Environmentalists Allied for Recycling (BEAR), a project of Global Green USA, launched the initiative last Spring in an effort to bring together long-standing opponents in the battle over different approaches to recycling in a fact-based approach to public policy making. Project participants included The Coca-Cola Company, Waste Management, Inc., Beaulieu of America, Tomra North America, Southeastern Container, GrassRoots Recycling Network and the Container Recycling Institute.  The report was prepared by a research consulting!
 team comprising R.W. Beck, Inc., Franklin Associates, Ltd., the Tellus Institute and Sound Resource Management Group.  Research was coordinated by the project manager, Boisson & Associates. 

Working intensively over six months, project participants made progress towards their objective of identifying jointly supported policies by participating in a study of existing U.S. recovery programs.  'We made a good start by showing that groups with divergent views can work together and reach substantial agreement,' said Ben Jordan, Environmental Manager for The Coca-Cola Company. 'We didn't agree to recommend any particular program, but we established a model for overcoming the historical entrenchment that has stymied progress for two decades,' according to Rick Best, Board Member of GrassRoots Recycling Network. 

The report is a snapshot of U.S. programs as they operated in 1999, and does not attempt to project how programs would perform if they were to be expanded or replicated in other areas.  The report contrasts the effectiveness of different programs in detail, and verifies that deposit systems recover the highest percentage of discarded containers, followed by municipal curbside programs and residential drop-off programs. 'But the cost of recovery programs is more subtle than advocates on either side have been willing to admit,' said Pierre Ferrari, BEAR's Chair. The findings indicate some ways that the costs of deposit and other recycling programs can be reduced. But participants stressed that the report does not attempt to address important implementation questions regarding new or expanded recycling systems.  The report also shows the environmental advantages of recycling containers.  'We documented several key benefits in this collaborative process, for example, beverage co!
ntainer recycling saved about 147 trillion BTU in 1999, that's equivalent to over 32 million barrels of oil,' said Matt Petersen, President and CEO of Global Green USA. 

Project participants agreed that there is a need to continue fact-based, collaborative discussions and will invite additional stakeholders to participate.  'The Multi-Stakeholder Recovery Project is a critical component of the movement to secure voluntary, long-term product stewardship agreements in the U.S.,' according to Sherry Enzler, Director of the Minnesota Office of Environmental Assistance. Future efforts are likely to concentrate on addressing stakeholder concerns about different policies. One key issue is the need for aggressive market development initiatives to minimize potential market volatility associated with increasing recovery. 

Businesses and Environmentalists Allied for Recycling, a project of Global Green USA, is a coalition dedicated to increasing the national recycling rate for used beverage containers to 80%.  Its members are united by agreement on principles including: minimizing environmental impacts while improving all packaging, creating sustainable jobs and businesses, and working with clarity and honesty to understand costs and evaluate the widest range of policies and practices to achieve its goal.   Global Green USA -- created in 1994 as the U.S. affiliate of Mikhail Gorbachev's environmental movement Green Cross International  -- works in cooperation with individuals, industry, and government to foster a global value shift toward a sustainable and secure world. The report, and additional information on the project, are available on BEAR's website at www.globalgreen.org/bear.

"RE: Ohio Label","We will be serving physical in CG&E territory beginning in Feb. 2002 (this was jut pushed back from Dec. 2001).  Origination will begin preselling beginning this week.  Therefore, on the Disclosure Label, which we would present to customers along with contracts between now and Feb., are we ok with stating ""Unknown Purchases"" and then change that once we're not buying on the spot market?

Subject:	RE: Ohio Label

Heather,

To the best of my knowledge the only customers in Ohio where physical delivery ""CURRENTLY"" takes place is First Energy (MSG PRODUCT ONLY) and the First Energy utilities should be directly providing the Disclosure Labels or provide load serving entities with the information necessary to complete the Disclosure Labels.  Physical delivery of power, other than MSG PRODUCT, may occur between November 2001 and March 2002; in either event Disclosure Labels need to be submitted to customers with the initial contracts and not again until immediately prior to physical delivery of power.

In all likelihood, spot purchases of power, rather than specific purchases of power, will occur therefore the Disclosure Label ""can only"" contain Unknown Purchases, as described by Stacey Bolton.  

Heather, I think that the three of us (you, Stacey and myself) need to discuss proper procedures regarding Disclosure Labels.

Richard

Heather,

We are not delivering any power, other than Market Support Generation (MSG), which is provided by the First Energy utility companies.  It should either be the utilities that provide disclosure label information for our label we have to default to ""Unknown Purchases"" or whatever else is allowed/required by the Ohio PUC's.

We need to start sending our Ohio label with the contract to new Ohio customers (CG&E starting in Dec according to Nicole Schwartz).  I've had Sandy Cofer look over this one that was done by Allison way back when to see if it still meets requirements, and it does.  Can you confirm the fuel mixes, etc. for me?

Light-Load Levity

Western peak power prices were higher for Thursday delivery on rising
natural gas values, but the real gainers of the day were off-peak prices,
which rose as much as 8.75$/MWh.  Some players also attributed a bit of the
daily strength to increased heating demand in the Northwest as the nights
grow longer and colder.  Spot gas at the Southern California Border made
more significant gains on Wednesday, with trades heard from 2.6 to
2.65$/mmBtu, compared to Tuesday's range of 2.37 to 2.42$/mmBtu.  NYMEX
Henry Hub gas contracts were on the rise early Wednesday due to cool weather
forecasts and some technical buying, but ended sharply lower following the
late release of a bearish AGA inventory report.  November Hub gas ended down
17.4 cents at 2.418$/MWh, after an early rise to a session high of
2.69$/mmBtu.  December shed 14.9 cents to close at 2.703$/mmBtu.  Wednesday'
s AGA report showed a build of 63 bcf in U.S. natural gas inventories last
week, above industry expectations and last year's 29-bcf gain.  Total U.S.
inventories stood at 3.042 tcf, 471 bcf above the same week a year ago and
267 bcf higher than the five-year average.  One gas trader commented, ""U.S.
stocks are already above the end-of-October levels seen the past four out of
five years.""  Of the 63 bcf injected last week, 12 bcf were injected in the
Western Consuming Region.  Total inventories in the West stood at 464 bcf,
compared to 378 bcf a year ago, and the five-year average of 384 bcf.

Both peak and off-peak spot electricity prices in the Northwest rose by as
much as 4$/MWh on Wednesday.  The increase in off-peak prices was largely
blamed on longer and colder fall nights, while the on-peak rise was
attributed to lower hydro flows associated with the commencement of Vernita
Bar.  Originally scheduled to begin on October 14, Vernita Bar operations
were slated to begin at midnight on Thursday.  The yearly operations involve
curtailing flows during the daylight hours, while increasing them during the
nighttime hours to ensure that salmon eggs remained covered with water.
""This is when we get into reverse load factoring,"" said one Northwest hydro
operator.  ""We will probably only be able to generate about half as much
during the day as we can at night.""  Historically, Vernita Bar operations
result in a narrowing of the peak and off-peak spread, as heavy load prices
rise and light load prices fall.  However, as one marketer put it, ""People
overreact to the start of Vernita Bar operations every year, but they need
to remember that this is a shoulder month.""  Vernita Bar operations are
scheduled to be in place until November 22.  In unit news, reports indicated
that Wyoming-based Jim Bridger #4 (520 MW) was taken off line Wednesday for
repairs to a cooling tower.  Sources indicated that said repairs would last
until October 20, and possibly longer.

Electricity prices in the Golden State gained ground across the board in
Wednesday trade, with higher natural gas prices and more off-line megawatts
propelling the cash market upward.  Peak power at COB changed hands in a
narrow range from 28.25 to 28.75$/MWh, while light load goods went for 23.25
to 23.5$/MWh.  NP15 heavy load pieces transacted at prices from 27.75 to
30$/MWh, while light load prices ranged from 25 to 26.5$/MWh.  SP15 peak
power saw action between 29 and 30.75$/MWh, with off-peak power trading for
21.25 to 26$/MWh.  Weather remained warm on Wednesday, with temperatures in
the normal range.  Daytime highs were mostly in the high-60s to 70s, with
southern inland areas seeing 80 degrees.  Temperatures were expected to
remain at current levels through Sunday, while the latest six-to-ten called
for below-normal temperatures for the entire state from October 23 to 27.
On the unit front, the ISO reported that the gas-fired Sunrise (338 MW) unit
was down for planned reasons.  Los Medanos (550 MW) was running at 125 MW,
and Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) was curtailed to 350 MW.

Amid rising natural gas values, peak power prices rose in the desert
Southwest for Thursday delivery, but their gains paled in comparison to
those realized for the off-peak hours.  Heavy load energy at Palo gained as
much as 3.15$/MWh, with confirmed transactions between 27.5 and 31.5$/MWh,
and unconfirmed transactions as high as 32.5$/MWh.  Meanwhile, light load
goods at Palo Verde gained as much as 6.5$/MWh for the day, and Mead rose as
much as a whopping 8.75$/MWh.  Four Corners #4 (750 MW) remained off line
Wednesday afternoon, after coming down for tube leak repairs last weekend.
Sources expected the unit to return to service late Wednesday night or early
on Thursday.  Further to the north, Wyoming-based LRS #3 (550 MW) came down
around 12:00 PDT Wednesday, though no cause or ETR were available at the
time of this writing.  Additionally, sources indicated that Colorado-based
Craig #1 (428 MW) would operate at about half capacity until further notice
for unspecified reasons.

___________________________________________________________
Peak power prices across the Eastern Interconnect were up in Wednesday
trade, mainly on Tuesday's surge in natural gas prices, which continued into
Wednesday, and a busy cash market.  Weather across the regions remained
cool, with daytime temperatures uniformly in the 50s and 60s.  Overnight
lows dipped into the 30s and 40s, stimulating some heating demand,
particularly in the northern regions.  Nuclear outages were said to be at a
minimum, with the only outages being units already down for autumn
refueling.  The AGA released its report on last week's natural gas
inventories, reporting a slightly bearish 63-bcf injection.  NYMEX Henry Hub
natural gas contracts tumbled on that late-session news, with November
closing down 17.4 cents at 2.418$/mmBtu.  December slipped 14.9 cents to end
at 2.703$/mmBtu.

In the Mid-Atlantic, heavy load energy costs climbed 1.5$/MWh on the high
end, with Western PJM prices ranging from 26 to 27$/MWh for Thursday
delivery.  Most traders believed Salem #1 (1,106 MW) was supplying power to
the grid on Wednesday.  Off-line generation was pegged at just over 8,000
MW, a decrease from Tuesday's 9,176 MW figure, which dovetailed nicely with
the presumed return of Salem #1.  LMPs leapt to 46$/MWh between 06:15 and
07:00 EDT, before settling back down around the day's average of 22$/MWh.
Weather in the region was cool on Wednesday, with temperatures 5 to 10
degrees below normal.  Daytime highs were expected to edge back into the 60s
and 70s by the weekend, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
predicting above-normal temperatures from October 23 to 27.

Amid cool weather across the Midwest and brisker trading, peak power prices
strengthened on Wednesday.  Into Cinergy goods were exchanged for prices
ranging from 21.5 to 23.35$/MWh, an increase of 1.35$/MWh on the high end.
Daytime temperatures across ECAR only reached highs in the low 50s, while
overnight temperatures in the 30s necessitated heating load.  However, the
jump in weather-related demand was expected to be short-lived, as
temperatures were predicted to be back in the upper-60s by the weekend and
the most current six-to-ten-day forecast called for normal to above-normal
temperatures from October 23 to 27.  Nuclear generation was thought to be
healthy, with the return of large unit Braidwood #1 (1,120 MW) from its fall
refueling outage.

In the Southeast, peak power prices for Thursday delivery increased as cool
weather blanketed the regions, bringing overnight lows in the 30s and 40s.
Into Entergy pieces traded in a tighter range to a day ago, between 20.5 and
21.45$/MWh, gaining 0.85$/MWh on the high end.  Into TVA prices also surged
higher, with deals done between 21.5 and 24.25$/MWh.  No new nuclear outages
were known Wednesday.  Weather across SERC was brisk, with temperatures 10
to 15 degrees below normal and overnight lows in the 30s.  Temperatures were
expected to climb by the weekend, and the latest six-to-ten called for
above-normal temperatures from October 23 through 27.

EESI sells to EPMI, 14 MW's, Sundays ATC, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)

I do not know for sure how whether or not EPMI still plans to deliver to EEMC and/or LADWP, however if they plan to continue these sales and depending on our decision relative to Fetzer Vineyards and/or Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia), we may want to keep the Green Power Partners I LLC Agreement alive.  I have discussed the EPMI deals with LADWP with Chris Foster, EPMI Portland Office and am currently awaiting an answer from Chris as to the current status with LADWP.

Let me know if you have any questions.

In this case there is a product element because at least the 2 retail contracts I named require us to serve green. If we assume them, we have to have green to serve.

I thought the call on whether a contract is rejected was an economic call and not a product call.  If this is not the case then could we be forced to swallow the other discount off tariff contracts we  intend to reject?

Further, we need to know what the revenue is against this purchase to make a call on the economics.  

Richard - Do you have the Patagonia Contract? And/or any of the other green power transactions that EES has entered into with customer's?

Sounds like the economic justification for rejection is clear.  However, we need to be sure that we are not going to keep any customers where we have a contractual requirement to serve green power (Fetzer; Patagonia).  If we are comfortable that we are not, I think we can reject.

take a look at this. Unless there is a customer or regulatory reason to keep this, PPA, it would seem to me that we would want to reject this contract.

Thoughts/comments so we can proceed.

Murry,

Our forward curves show SP-15 power at $26.57/MWh for the period 02/01/2002-12/31/2002 (note that this does not include the discount for unit-contingency that usually accompanies wind power).  Green tags trade in the market for about $1.50/MWh.  Under the ""Green Tickets Sales Agreement"" it appears that EES has agreed to pay $39/MWh minus the market price of power, which is approximately $12/MWh for Green Tickets using our forward curves.

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Attached you will find two agreements EES has with ENRON Wind. 

1- Green Ticket Purchase Sale Agreement (PPA)
2- Scheduling Coordinator Service Agreement

With EES & ENA bankruptcy and the fact that Enron Wind has not been paid for the generation back to the month of November through current, Enron Wind is attempting to move their needs to APX for SC Services.  I also think they were looking for someone else to purchase their energy.  

I put a temporary stop on their actions but we are going to need to review these contracts to determine if we want to continue operating under them.

Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.

Thanks - MO

our market.
This one will be conducted at 48th & Broadway in New York City.
Details on the program can be found on our website at:

I thought this was something that is

of the protocols.

Currently, ERCOT calculates ancillary service obligations for each QSE
for a given trade day based on the QSE???s aggregated Load Ratio Share as
of the same day of the prior week.  This results in the use of QSE/LSE
relationships from one week prior to calculate ancillary service
obligations.  When an LSE switches from one QSE to another, the
obligation associated with its load continue to be allocated to the old
QSE for one week after the effective date of the switch.  The same
obligation does not get allocated to the new QSE for the first week
after the switch.  QSEs also do not have access to Load Ratio Share data
per LSE that makes up their ancillary service obligations.

This modification will alter the way the QSE Load Ratio Shares are
aggregated so that ancillary service obligations are calculated based on
the QSE/LSE relationships that will be effective on the trade day for
which obligations are being posted.  Load Ratio Shares will be
calculated and saved by LSE during the data aggregation process run for
initial settlement of the trade day in question.  QSE Load Ratio Share
will then be aggregated and posted for a given trade day based on the
sum of LSE Load Ratio Shares calculated as described above corresponding
to the most current QSE/LSE relationships for that trade day.

Scheduled Extract Changes:  Billing determinants for LSE Load Ratio
Shares called LRSLSE will be added to the load extract.  Each QSE will
have the LRSLSE fields added to its load extract for each LSE it
represents.  Each LSE will also have the LRSLSE field added to its load
extract with its Load Ratio Share information.   

Dynamic Extract:  The Settlement and Billing folder within the archive
extracts area of the portal will have an additional dynamic extract
folder added called ???Obligations???.  This dynamic extract folder will
have two extracts called ???QSE obligations??? and ???LSE obligations??? which
can be used to query Load Ratio Shares by QSE and LSE.  The following
ERCOT total quantities will also be added to the dynamic extracts above:

??        Total obligated non-spinning quantity (NSOTOT)

??        Total obligated regulation down quantity (RDOTOT)

??        Total obligated responsive reserve quantity (RROTOT)

??        Total obligated regulation up quantity (RUOTOT) 

 

You can find details of PRR-294 at the following link:
http://www.ercot.com/AboutERCOT/PublicDisclosure/ProtocolRev.htm .

If you have any questions, please call your ERCOT client service
representative.

Richard/Michele,

Here's a slightly revised version that should reflect your changes.  This version should be consistent with the latest  index TC language too.

Richard...I'll ask Mike Smith about your proposal to change the TC language (to eliminate what the EESI Energy Price ""does not include"").  This change is not reflected here yet.

I'll attached this PAT version to the latest TC and continue routing for final approvals.  Let me know if you see any further problems.

 

Thanks for reviewing!
Bob

"City of Houston RPF Information","Here is information taken from the City's website.   From my interpretation, MWBE participate is a consideration and encouraged, but not necessarily required.  

 Request for Proposals (RFPs) - Request for Proposals are used to solicit equipment, goods, and services of a highly technical nature. 
RFPs are taken in accordance with State law provision under Vernon's Annotated Civil Statutes (V.A.C.S. ? 252), which is a unit of the Texas Legislative Council's statutory revision program authorized by the Texas Local Government Code. As an example, the City will solicit requests for proposals for information processing equipment, software and hardware used in conjunction with information processing equipment, telecommunications, radio and microwave systems, electronic distributed control systems and technical services related to this equipment. RFPs are also reviewed for MWBE opportunities.
Formal Bids - Written solicitations exceeding $15,000 for goods and nonprofessional services. 
These bids are taken in accordance with State law. Bids are advertised for two consecutive weeks in the Houston Business Journal and minority papers, then received by the City Secretary's Office on the advertised bid due date, opened and publicly read in the City Council Chambers (unless place of opening has been transferred in accordance with Section 15-3 B(5) of the City of Houston Code of Ordinances.) The City Purchasing Agent recommends awards for formal bids to City Council. Prior to issuing a bid invitation estimated to be in excess of $100,000, Strategic Purchasing reviews and researches each for the purpose of determining subcontracting possibilities. When it is evident there is MWBE subcontracting potential, a goal is assigned to give certified MWBE suppliers additional opportunity to participate in City business.

Construction - Projects involving improvement to City facilities amounting to $500,000 or less. 
Sealed bids are taken in accordance with State law for various construction projects amounting to $500,000 or less. Bid Bonds are required on all Construction Projects. Projects exceeding $25,000 require bidders to submit a payment bond and those exceeding $100,000 require a payment and performance bond. The City Purchasing Agent recommends award of contracts to City Council. Certified MWBE's are encouraged to bid as prime contractors.

Taking Stock in Gas

Western peak power prices rose Friday on the usual weekend premium and
hydroelectric curtailments in the Northwest.  The annual Vernita Bar fish
operation commenced on Thursday, reducing the amount of generation during
the peak hours, and increasing output over the light load hours.  ""During
the heavy load hours we can roughly generate about half of what we can for
the light load hours,"" said one hydro operator.  Some traders, however,
questioned the amount of impact the flow restrictions were having on the
dailies.  ""Reduced hydroelectric output isn't the real market-moving force,
gas is,"" said one analyst.  While spot gas prices dipped slightly on Friday,
NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts were sharply higher in moderate trade.
The gas contracts were propelled higher by some short covering ahead of the
weekend, a cooler six-to-ten-day forecast, and long-term outlooks released
earlier in the week calling for a ""colder-than-usual"" winter.  November Hub
gas settled 19.5 cents higher at 2.681$/mmBtu, after reaching a session high
of 2.72$/mmBtu.  December rose 19 cents to close at 2.99$/mmBtu.  Total U.S.
storage stood at 3.042 tcf, or about 92% full.  Some analysts believed that
gas inventories could climb to a record 3.15 tcf in the three remaining
weeks of stock-building season.

Day-ahead energy costs in the Northwest got a good boost Friday on the
typical risk associated with trading three days out, and on reduced
hydroelectric output during the peak hours.  A few traders seemed a little
surprised that off-peak prices rose by an average of 2.25$/MWh given that
Vernita Bar operations allow for more generation during the light load
hours, but factor in all-day Sunday and there is no surprise.  Peak power at
the Mid-Columbia ranged from 26 to 28$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions
occurring between 27 and 27.25$/MWh.  The only unit of consequence remaining
off-line in the Northwest was Bridger #4 (520 MW), but the Wyoming-based
thermal unit was expected to return over the weekend.  Weather forecasts
called for normal temperatures into the first part of the new week, with the
possibility of precipitation.  NOAA announced their winter forecast for the
U.S. on Thursday, and said the Northwest can go either way as far as being
cold or warm. They also said to expect more rain than last year.

California electricity prices for Sunday and Monday strengthened in Friday
trade, with the light load prices up the most on the inclusion of the
all-day Sunday block.  Peak prices at COB ranged from 26 to 28$/MWh,
climbing a buck, and off-peak goods traded between 23.5 and 24.5$/MWh,
firming up 1.5$/MWh on the low end and 50 cents on the high.  NP15 and SP15
pieces traded almost flat to one other, with NP15 at a slight premium. In
financial news, California's DWR, the purchaser of power for most Golden
State residents, revised its projected costs for buying electricity next
year down to $17.2 billion.  The 20% reduction was based mainly on the
continued decline of spot electricity and natural gas prices.  Originally,
the DWR had expected to pay $21.45 billion for the procurement of power.
Daytime temperatures for Monday and Tuesday were expected to be near normal,
in the 65 to 75 degree range, while the latest six-to-ten called for
above-normal temperatures from October 25 to 29.  On the unit front,
gas-fired Scattergood #3 (445 MW) was down for unplanned maintenance without
an ETR.  On an up note, Sunrise Power Plant (338 MW) was nearing full power
Friday morning.

Despite a continued blanketing of above-normal temperatures, Monday's peak
power prices in the Southwest were up only slightly from levels reported for
the Friday/Saturday package.  The price tag on light load energy rose more
substantially, gaining as much as 2.75$/MWh at Palo Verde.  Heavy load
energy at the Southwest hub traded in a range of 26 to 28$/MWh, a rise of
only 50 cents on the low end.  There was little in the way of unit news on
Friday.  Arizona-based Coronado #2 (385 MW) was expected to be back in
service sometime on Monday, following valve repairs.  Weather forecasts
called for slight cooling early in the new week, but temperatures were
expected to remain at above-normal levels.  Furthermore, the latest
six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting above-normal temperatures for the
entire desert region from October 25 through 29.

___________________________________________________________
Amid expectations of warmer weather for Monday and little news of
curtailments, peak power prices for Monday delivery posted mixed results
across the Eastern Interconnect in Friday trade.  Daytime temperatures
reached the mid-60s in the Midwest and along the northern seaboard, with 70
to 75 degree ranges seen in the south.  Monday temperatures were expected to
be warmer, but the hot flash should be short-lived as below normal
temperatures were forecast for October 25 to 29.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas
contracts rose substantially in end-of-the-week trade.  November climbed
19.5 cents to close at 2.681$/mmBtu, while December gained 19 cents to end
at 2.990$/mmBtu.

Heavy load energy costs for Monday delivery were seen trading in a slightly
wider range on Friday, gaining ground on the high end.  Western PJM goods
changed hands between 24.9 and 26.25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done
around 25.5$/MWh.  November forward contracts climbed as well, with
unconfirmed trades as high as 27.95$/MWh.  New England nuke Seabrook #1
(1161 MW), down since Monday, was expected to return to service over the
weekend, and with Nine Mile Point 2 (1142 MW) back as well, sellers
anticipated less demand from NEPOOL in the new week.  LMPs were averaging
22.18$/MWh through 16:00 EDT, after a brief mid-morning spike to 61$/MWh.
Actual loads were drifting below forecasted loads for most of the afternoon.
Temperatures through Tuesday were expected to be above normal in the 50s and
60s, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for below-normal
temperatures from October 25 to 29.

In the Midwest, peak power prices fell in Friday trade, with predictions of
warmer weather for Monday.  Into Cinergy goods were bought and sold between
19.5 and 22$/MWh, with most trades in the 21 to 21.8$/MWh range.  November
forward contracts also rose, with reported prices as high as 23.3$/MWh.
Daytime temperatures for the early part of the new week were expected in the
60s and 70s, with mild overnights.  The most current six-to-ten called for
below-normal temperatures from October 25 to 29.

In the Southeast, peak power prices stayed mostly steady on Friday.  Into
Entergy pieces were exchanged between 20 and 21.5$/MWh.  Electricity prices
into TVA ranged from 21 to 22$/MWh.  In unit news, nuke Surry #1 (781 MW)
entered its fall refueling outage, while fellow nuke Hatch #2 (813 MW) was
expected to exit its refueling outage over the weekend.  Weather across the
region was expected to be warmer Monday and Tuesday, with daytime
temperatures in the 75 to 83 degree range.  However, the latest six-to-ten
predicted normal to below-normal temperatures from October 25 to 29.

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

ENERGY UPDATES

Deadline Extended for Higher Cool Roof Rebate Amount

In order to maximize opportunities to reduce electricity demand this year, the California Energy Commission (CEC) has extended the deadline for the higher Cool Roof rebate amount of 20? per square foot until October 31, 2001. After October 31st, rebates will be reduced to 15?/sf. 

Over $21 million in financial incentives are being offered by the CEC for the installation of cool roofs on existing and new buildings. Eligible buildings include: local government, educational, commercial, and multi-family. New residential developments are also eligible; however, existing single-family homes are not.

By reflecting rather than absorbing solar energy, a cool roof reduces roof temperatures by 50 - 60 ?F compared to a traditional 'hot' roof. As a result, a cool roof lowers a building's cooling energy requirements (by over 20%), increases the life-span of the roof, and reduces peak electricity demand. In addition, since the installed price of cool roofing materials is typically the same as non-reflective materials, the rebate makes cool roofs less expensive than traditional roofs.

The CEC has partnered with the non-profit Local Government Commission (LGC) to administer the cool roof incentives statewide. To learn more about the program, visit the LGC's web site at: www.lgc.org/techserve/coolroofs/. Or call the Cool Roof Hotline at 1.888.891.COOL(2665).


Neutrogena Invests in Solar Energy

Several communities and businesses are taking action now to
reduce carbon emissions, despite the United States government's recent rejection of the Kyoto Protocol on
Climate Change.  Neutrogena, a division of Johnson & Johnson, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) announced the completion of a 200-kilowat, $1.4 million solar power system at the company's headquarters in Los Angeles.  Neutrogena said a new solar system covering 24,000 square feet of roof area will help reduce the company's energy consumption by about 20 percent monthly.  According to Angelina Galiteva, LADWP director of strategic planning, the Neutrogena system will eliminate more than 513,000 pounds of carbon dioxide annually.

CHEMICAL AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS UPDATE 

U.S. Seeks To Stiffen Treaty on Germ War - Pact's Enforcement Mechanism Faulted 

President Bush continues to oppose a proposed enforcement mechanism for a treaty banning the development or stockpiling of biological weapons but is
pursuing an alternative with new urgency in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, administration officials said yesterday.

The administration began telling allies this spring that it would not support a proposal to prevent cheating on the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention,
which the United States ratified with 142 other nations. The administration said the verification proposal was fatally flawed, but said the United States
wanted to find other ways to strengthen the treaty and reduce the chance of germ warfare.

Administration officials said they plan to present their ideas at a biological weapons conference that begins Nov. 19 in Switzerland. Officials said the
administration plans to propose that nations pass stricter laws criminalizing the use and import or export of biological weapons, fund more research into
illnesses caused by biological weapons, and share information and expertise to minimize the effects if the weapons are used.

LOS ANGELES EVENTS WITH PRESIDENT GORBACHEV POSTPONED

Following President Gorbachev's decision to cancel his October trip to the U.S., Global Green USA has postponed the Sustainability Symposium and Green Cross Millennium Awards scheduled for October 13. Mikhail Gorbachev has committed to rescheduling his participation in both events so he can join with us in the celebration at a later time.  We 
will provide you with a tentative rescheduled date within the next week. 

In the meantime, our collective work must and will continue.  The efforts of 
Global Green USA to eliminate weapons of mass destruction and reduce 
environmental degradation -- a phenomenon that contributes to the root 
causes of terrorism, hatred, and fundamentalism -- find new purpose and 
meaning during this time.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

UPCOMING EVENTS:

EARTH DIALOGUES - LYON, FRANCE - Feb 21 to 23

6TH ANNUAL GREEN CROSS MILLENNIUM AWARDS - LOS ANGELES, CA - MARCH 15

5TH ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY SYMPOSIUM - LOS ANGELES, CA - MARCH 15

======================================================================

EARTH DIALOGUES - LYON, FRANCE - Feb 21 to 23

The Earth Dialogues were launched by Mikhail Gorbachev and Maurice Strong to
provide a forum for constructive debate on the most pressing issues related
to global sustainability. Representatives of civil society, government,
international organizations, finance, business, religion, media and
academia, along with members of the public, will convene to exchange their
views on how to reinvigorate the ethics debate within the sustainable
development and globalization agendas and propose concrete actions to
address environmental degradation and poverty.

The 2002 Earth Dialogues will examine key issues related to the ethical
challenges of global responsibility, rights and social justice as related to
sustainable development, and propose concrete measures to ensure that the
benefits of globalization are more equitably shared throughout the world.
The conference will address the following questions:

1.    What are the factors that have impeded the implementation of existing
codes of environmental conduct and practice?


2.    Why are the tools already available to overcome these barriers to
sustainability not fully used or implemented?


3.    What role could universally agreed ethical standards for sustainable
development serve in eradicating poverty and spreading the benefits of
globalization
more equitably?


4.    What should be done to encourage the value and behavioral changes
needed for the implementation of environmental, economic and social best
practices?


5.    How can the Earth Charter contribute to framing a new ethic of global
responsibility?

Up to 1000 people are expected to attend the meetings, which will also be
widely broadcast and available on the Internet. In addition to the panel and
plenary debates, The Earth Dialogues program includes: An Earth Fair with
eco-efficiency displays from industry; Earth Art Exhibition, including the
work of children from around the world; Press Conferences; and an Earth
Music Concert, with top artists playing to tens of thousands of people.

NEWS AND EVENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
""FreedomCAR"" Program to Advance Fuel-Cell Vehicles

DOE announced last week a new government-industry
program for the advancement of high-efficiency cars:
""freedomCAR"". The new program will focus on fuel cells and
hydrogen production from renewable energy sources. DOE
will carry out the freedomCAR program in partnership with
the U.S. Council of Automotive Research -- a cooperative
research organization formed by Ford Motor Company,
General Motors Corporation, and DaimlerChrysler
Corporation. In fact, the ""CAR"" in ""freedomCAR"" stands for
""Cooperative Automotive Research.""

FreedomCAR replaces the Clinton-era ""Partnership for a
New Generation of Vehicles"" (PNGV), which aimed to
produce an affordable sedan that achieves 80 miles per
gallon by 2004. In contrast, the long-term goal for
freedomCAR is to develop technologies for hydrogen-
powered fuel cell vehicles that will require no foreign oil and
emit no harmful pollutants or greenhouse gases. An
interesting aspect of freedomCAR is its emphasis on
developing a hydrogen supply infrastructure: many
automotive companies are currently developing cars that
would be fueled with low-sulfur gasoline, methanol, or
natural gas fuels, which would be converted to hydrogen
using onboard fuel processors. FreedomCAR looks farther
ahead to an energy economy that is built around hydrogen
as the energy carrier.

See the DOE press release, with a link to a fact sheet, at:
<http://www.energy.gov/HQPress/releases02/janpr/pr02001.htm>.

So how do you produce hydrogen? Today, most hydrogen is
produced from fossil fuels. It can also be produced by
passing a current through two electrodes immersed in water,
but that technique tends to be expensive. Researchers are
now examining ways to make hydrogen from organic
materials, to generate it from organic processes, or to
produce it directly from sunlight and water. Some catalysts
help sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, but
researchers are also using modified solar cells immersed in
water, called photoelectrodes. For more information, see the
Hydrogen Information Network on EREN at:
<http://www.eren.doe.gov/hydrogen/>.

For those more technically inclined, the proceedings of the
2001 DOE Hydrogen Program Review are posted on the
Hydrogen Information Network at:
<http://www.eren.doe.gov/hydrogen/docs/30535toc.html>.


Ford Shows Hybrid Escape SUV at Detroit Auto Show

Ford Motor Company is displaying the hybrid electric version
of its Escape sport utility vehicle (SUV) at the North
American International Auto Show, now underway in Detroit.
Ford confirmed that the vehicle will be available in 2003, and
announced that its emissions will be low enough to qualify as
a Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle (PZEV) under California
law. The vehicle is expected to achieve nearly 40 miles to
the gallon. See the Ford Hybrid Electric Vehicle Web site at:
<http://www.hybridford.com/index.asp>.

While domestic auto companies continue to prepare their
hybrid-electric vehicles for production, U.S. sales of the
Toyota Prius and the Honda Insight continue to grow. Toyota
Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. announced that it sold 15,556
Priuses in the United States in 2001, up from 5,562 in 2000
(U.S. sales of the Prius began in mid-2000). American
Honda announced Insight sales of 4,726 in 2001, up from
3,788 in 2000.

See the Toyota press release, ""Toyota Sets Sales Record
for Sixth Year in a Row,"" on the Toyota Pressroom Web site
at: <http://pressroom.toyota.com/>.

See the American Honda press release at:
<http://www.hondacars.com/news/press.html?y=2002&r=770>.

The Honda Civic Hybrid, unveiled in Japan last month, had
its U.S. debut in Los Angeles early this month. Honda claims
the Civic Hybrid will achieve about 50 miles per gallon and
will cost about $20,000. Honda expects to sell 2,000 vehicles
per month when it goes on sale in the United States in April.

Wind Capacity Surges Ahead in the U.S. and the World

U.S. wind power capacity increased by 66 percent in 2001,
according to figures released yesterday by the American
Wind Energy Association (AWEA). The record growth of
1,694 megawatts boosted the total U.S. wind power capacity
from 2,564 megawatts to 4,258 megawatts. AWEA says last
year's installations represent capital investments of about
$1.7 billion and will produce enough electricity to meet the
annual needs of 475,000 U.S. households. See the January
15th press release on the AWEA Web site at:
<http://www.awea.org/news/index.html>.

The U.S. growth in wind capacity is actually outpacing the
world growth: according to the Earth Policy Institute, world
wind power capacity increased 31 percent in 2001. In fact,
wind capacity grew faster in the United States than in the
other four leading wind-development countries: Germany,
Denmark, India and Spain. Germany, however, still has
nearly twice the wind power capacity as the United States,
thanks to aggressive government policies for wind power
development. German wind power capacity overtook
U.S. wind power capacity in 1997. According to the Earth
Policy Institute, the world's total wind power capacity is now
at 23,300 megawatts -- more than five times the U.S. capacity.
See the Earth Policy press release, with links to detailed
tables and graphs, at:
<http://www.earth-policy.org/Updates/Update5.htm>.

(Note that the Earth Policy numbers are preliminary, so they
are slightly lower than the AWEA numbers.)

If the latest news is any indication, world wind power
capacity will continue to grow rapidly in 2002. Ireland gave
the go-ahead for the world's largest offshore wind power
facility last week. Ireland's Minister for the Marine and
Natural Resources approved a wind power lease of the
Arklow Bank, a sand bank located more than four miles off
the coast of Ireland. Eirtricity, Ireland's largest renewable
energy developer, intends to build a 520-megawatt wind
plant along the sand bank, beginning with 60 megawatts in
2002 and completing the site by 2005. See the eirtricity Web
site at: <http://www.eirtricity.ie/news-11-01-2002.htm>.


Wind Turbine Installed on Novel Tower Without Large Crane

A single 660-kilowatt wind turbine was installed in December
in Omaha, Nebraska, to serve a green power program run
by the Omaha Public Power District (OPPD). The installation
uses an innovative tower designed by Valmont Industries Inc.
that incorporates a lifting platform for installing the turbine.
The platform eliminated the need for a large crane to install
the turbine. See the OPPD Web site at:
<http://www.oppd.com/news/GreenPower.htm>.

Valmont Industries believes its wind turbine tower could help
expand the installation of wind turbines into rugged terrains
that present access problems for large cranes. See the
Valmont Web site at:
<http://www.valmont.com/poles/poles7.shtml>.


North Carolina Utilities to Pursue Green Power

A Green Power Program Advisory Committee formed last
year in North Carolina has led the electric utility companies
throughout the state to pursue a green power program.
According to Advanced Energy, which helped form the
advisory committee, the three investor-owned utilities in
North Carolina have publicly declared their intentions to file
for a green power program with the state's utility commission.
The state's municipal utilities and electric cooperatives have
also agreed to participate. A statewide program should be in
place by mid-year. Advanced Energy is a non-profit energy
consultancy founded by the North Carolina Utilities Commission
in 1980. See the Advanced Energy Web site at:
<http://www.advancedenergy.org/greenpower/index.html>.

Green power also continues to advance in Washington
state, where all the utilities are now required by law to offer a
green power program. The latest offerings come from Avista
Utilities, which serves nearly 310,000 electric customers in
eastern Washington and northern Idaho, and from Clark
Public Utilities in southwest Washington. Clark Public
Utilities is buying so-called ""green tags"" from the Bonneville
Environmental Foundation, while Avista is buying wind
power from the Stateline Wind Project that went online at
year end.

See the Avista Web site at:
<http://www.avistautilities.com/account/windpower.asp>.

And see the January 7th press release from Clark Public
Utilities by selecting ""News Releases"" on the Web site at:
<http://www.clarkpublicutilities.com/events.html>.

Utah Power's ""Blue Sky"" green power program is also
gaining ground -- Salt Lake City's Uinta Brewing Company
opened its new brewery last week with the announcement
that it will buy 100 percent renewable energy to power the
facility. The brewery expects to purchase more than a
quarter million kilowatt-hours of wind power per year. See
the announcement on the Utah Green Power Web site at:
<http://www.utahgreenpower.org/News.htm#uinta>.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is
encouraging more companies to buy green power through its
Green Power Partnership Program. Companies that commit
to buying green power will gain technical support and public
recognition from EPA by joining the partnership. See the
newly revised Green Power Partnership Program Web site
at: <http://www.epa.gov/greenpower/>.


New York Power Authority Buys Eight 200-Kilowatt Fuel Cells

UTC Fuel Cells announced last month the sale of eight fuel
cell systems to the New York Power Authority (NYPA), which
will use them at four wastewater treatment facilities in New
York City. NYPA will use waste gas (primarily methane) from
the water treatment process to power the fuel cells. Each of
the units generates 200 kilowatts of electricity. See the
UTC Fuel Cells press release at:
<http://www.utcfuelcells.com/news/archive/121901.shtml>.

Other recent fuel cell developments include the installation of
a Nuvera Fuel Cell at a Verizon telecommunications site in
Massachusetts and the shipment of a 5-kilowatt fuel cell --
produced by DCH Technologies, Inc. -- to the Houston
Advanced Research Center (HARC).

See the December 18th press release on the Nuvera Web
site at: <http://www.nuvera.com/>.

ENERGY FACTS AND TIPS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
U.S. Energy Companies Expanded Oil, Gas Reserves in 2000

The major U.S. energy companies achieved great success
with their drill bits in 2000, significantly boosting oil and gas
reserves, according to a report released last week by DOE's
Energy Information Administration (EIA). The major U.S.
energy producers expanded their worldwide oil and gas
reserves by an equivalent of 6.6 billion barrels of crude oil in
2000, exceeding their worldwide oil and gas production by
22 percent, allowing the reserves to gain some ground over
production.

Meanwhile, the companies actually gained 60 percent of
their oil and gas reserve increases through mergers and
acquisitions. The companies nearly doubled their worldwide
capital expenditures in 2000, and most of the growth in
spending went toward mergers and acquisitions. The
companies also posted record profits, as their net income
increased 133 percent from 1999 levels to a new record of
$53.2 billion. See the EIA press release, with a link to the full
report, at: <http://www.eia.doe.gov/neic/press/press188.html>.

Bob,

I think that for the moment the $0.25/MWh for the scheduling fee component is fine to utilize.  Michelle is in the process of reviewing all BGE scheduling requirements and within the next few days should have be able to determine the accuracy of the $0.25/MWh scheduling fee component.

Good Morning....

As a placeholder, Narsimha previously suggested $0.25/MWH for the scheduling fee component of the fixed ""Management Fee"".  Do you think this is still a reasonable number to use?  If so, we would use it in our notional estimates, and Deal Management would use the same value for executable pricing.   

Thanks!

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Intertie De-rated

Amid a backdrop of mild weather and steady to falling loads across the
region, Western peak power prices held steady in Friday trade.  The volume
of trading was exceptionally low and price ranges tightened across every
trading hub, usually with the low end coming up to meet the high.  ""Heavy
load volume went way down, but I'm at a loss as to why off-peak demand
continued to trade,"" mumbled one bewildered player.  One analyst speculated
that with daytime highs near comfortable levels, ""heating demand should only
be kicking in at night.""  The market did indeed appear unusual throughout
the West on Friday.  Contrary to norms, power at Palo Verde and South Path
sold at a premium to Mid-Columbia pieces.  One possible factor for this
anomaly could be the de-rating of the California-Oregon Intertie from
between three- and four-thousand megawatts to 600 MW for scheduled
maintenance, which will last through October 28.  ""This could have
effectively isolated the Pacific Northwest with lower load demands and
near-normal generating capacity, only with nobody to whom to export,"" one
analyst postulated.  While NYMEX made up for Thursday's losses, spot gas
prices at the Southern California border fell by almost 25 cents on Friday.
The Henry Hub natural gas contract for November climbed 10.3 cents to close
at 3.041$/mmBtu, while December gas trailed along, gaining 8 cents on Friday
's trades to close at 3.183$/mmBtu.

On Friday, Mid-Columbia peak power traded at a discount to power in the
Southwest.  Heavy load pieces traded in a tight range, between 31.5 to
33.4$/MWh on Friday, and this included the usual premium that comes with
trading three days out. One player speculated that the lack of volatility at
Mid-Columbia was due to the ""loss of transmission capacity at the
California-Oregon Intertie.""  Temperatures were forecast to hover near
normal in the Northwest through the weekend, with reservoir-building
precipitation called for on Friday, Monday and Tuesday.  The latest
six-to-ten predicted near-to-above normal temperatures would prevail from
November 1 to 5, which suggested that daytime heating demand would not be
likely in the week-and-a-half to come.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph held
steady at 45 kcfs for Saturday, 40 kcfs Sunday, 65 kcfs from Monday through
Thursday, and 60 kcfs on Friday.  No specific unit news was forthcoming,
although aggregate output of northwest hydro units was reportedly down by
over 1400 MW due to curtailed flows.

Golden State electricity prices were mostly flat for the Sunday/Monday
package to Thursday, with off-peak prices edging up on the usual all-day
Sunday premium.  Light load energy costs at SP15 and NP15 climbed 2.1 and
3$/MWh, respectively.  SP15 prices were seen at a slight premium to NP15 in
a light trading session, as many players sat on the sidelines, covering
their loads, but otherwise out of the spot market.  In political news,
California's State Board of Equalization voted to switch tax jurisdiction of
power plants from the local to the state level in 2003.  The state reported
it will tax the plants based on ""fair market share"", and predicted that more
revenues will be raised under the new system.   Also in the news, California
will not build new transmission lines, used to import power from neighboring
states Nevada and Arizona, until at least 2008.  The generation landscape
was little changed on Friday.  The Shasta hydro units (526 MW) were
completely off-line.  ""The reservoirs are probably too low to support any
generation right now,"" speculated one analyst.  Temperatures in California
were expected to range from the low-70s to low-50s through Tuesday,
producing little weather-related electricity demand in the state.  Keeping
hope for more demand in the near future down, the latest six-to-ten from the
NWS called for normal temperatures from November 1 to 5.

Southwest peak power was a hot commodity in the WSCC on Friday.  Peak goods
for Monday delivery fluctuated between 33 and 36.5$/MWh at Palo Verde, which
boasted a higher volume of trade than its neighboring hubs.  Some players
speculated that the ""Palo premium"" was based on high natural gas prices that
caused many California gas-fired plants to remain dormant and buy power from
outside the state.  ""Without the California-Oregon Intertie, nobody could
access Northwest hydropower, so everybody lined up at Palo Verde and SP-15,""
commented one seasoned marketer.  Temperatures ranged from the high 80s in
Phoenix to the mid-60s in Salt Lake City, with forecasts calling for
temperatures to continue to hover just above normal through Tuesday.  The
latest six-to-ten extended the above-normal forecast through November 5.  On
the generation front, Navajo #1 (750 MW) returned to the grid on Thursday
night as expected after completing water pump repairs.

In an active Friday trading session, peak power prices for Monday delivery
strengthened across the Eastern Interconnect on cooler weather and
increasing natural gas prices.  ""This week the power markets are following
gas up.  Some Hubs, like Entergy, were simply too cheap before, and those
have made particularly strong gains,"" opined one market analyst.  The
mercury dropped all across the East Friday, and was expected to remain in
the nippy range through Tuesday.  Forecasts were calling for daytime highs
only in the 40s and 50s, and overnight lows in the downright chilly 20s and
30s were expected.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas contracts traded actively on Friday,
a day ahead of expiring November contracts on Monday.   November climbed
10.3 cents to close at 3.041$/mmBtu, and December also edged up 8 cents to
end at 3.183$/mmBtu.

Heavy load energy costs in the Mid-Atlantic rose in Friday trade, amid
higher predicted loads for Monday and strong natural gas markets.
Generation was healthier on Friday, with off-line Megawatts dropping.  Nuke
Indian Point #2 (965 MW) was off-line, entering a 20 day maintenance outage,
and rumors indicated that Peach Bottom #2 (1,152 MW) might have returned to
the grid a day ahead of schedule on Friday.  Western PJM goods were trading
from 31.4 to 32.9$/MWh. With a mean of 22.5$/MWh through 15:00 EDT, LMPs
were very stable on Friday, fluctuating within 4$/MWh of the average all day
after the usual early-morning spike.  Overnight lows in the 30s were
expected through Tuesday of the new week, kicking up heating demand.
Nonetheless, the latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for above-normal
temperatures from November 1 to 5.

Like the rest of the Eastern spot market, peak power prices in the Midwest
were natural gas dependent on Friday. No new outages were reported and gas
costs were expected to outweigh weather-related demand for the new week.
Electricity prices edged down slightly, with Into Cinergy goods changing
hands between 31 and 32.5$/MWh, losing 1.45$/MWh on the high end, but
tightening the range on the low.  The Midwest was expected to be the coldest
region over the weekend and into the new week, with temperatures not
expected to reach any higher than 59 degrees through Tuesday, with overnight
lows in the 20s and 30s.  However, the latest six-to-ten predicted
above-normal temperatures from November 1 to 5.

In the Southeast on Friday trading was particularly active, with heavy load
electricity prices gaining ground yet again, as a brief bout of winter
weather was expected for the new week and strong natural gas costs pushed
prices higher.  Into Entergy pieces traded between 25.55 and 29$/MWh, with
the day's low seen right out of the gate and the high reached late in the
session.  Some market players mentioned that cash gas (inside the month
trades) were really moving the Entergy market on Friday.  Into TVA was a
less liquid market, with deals done between 30 and 34.5$/MWh.  Temperatures
were expected well below normal through Tuesday, with overnight lows solidly
in the 30s.  The weather trend was expected to reverse though, with
above-normal temperatures predicted from November 1 to 5.

NEWS AND EVENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
California Cut Electricity Use by 6.7 Percent in 2001

The final numbers for California's electricity use in 2001 are in,
and they're impressive: compared to 2000, the state reduced
its total electricity use by 6.7 percent and its peak electricity
demand by 8.9 percent, or nearly 3,800 megawatts. Those
numbers are adjusted for economic growth and differences in
weather, but the cold, raw numbers still show a 4.4 percent
drop in electricity use and a 5.4 percent drop in peak demand.
Governor Gray Davis lauded Californians for their achievement.
See the statistics, with a link to a January 17th press release
from Governor Davis, at:
<http://www.energy.ca.gov/electricity/peak_demand_reduction.html>.

The Pacific Northwest can be proud, too, according to DOE's
Bonneville Power Administration (BPA): the region reduced its
electricity demand by roughly 85 megawatts, or enough to
power more than 80,000 homes, in 2001. See the BPA press
release at: <http://www.bpa.gov/Corporate/KCC/nr/02nr/nr011702.shtml>.


Spire Solar Chicago Installs 100 Kilowatts of Solar Power

Spire Solar Chicago, a business unit of Spire Corporation,
announced last week the installation of a total of 100 kilowatts
of solar photovoltaic systems on six roofs in Chicago. The
systems were installed on the DuSable Museum of African
American History, the Homan Square Community Center,
Commonwealth Edison's South Hydome facility, two Chicago
public schools, and a small commercial building. The
installations are part of a local public/private partnership to
produce clean energy in Chicago. See the Spire press release
at: <http://www.spirecorp.com/Spire/news/PV369.html>.


DOT Proposes No Change in Light Truck Efficiency Standards

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
NHTSA), a part of the U.S. Department of Transportation
(DOT), released last week its proposed fuel efficiency
standards for Model Year 2004 light trucks. The proposed
standard holds the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency
(CAFE) standard for light trucks at its current level of
20.7 miles per gallon. The light truck classification includes
vans, pickup trucks, and most sport utility vehicles (SUVs).

Since 1996, Congress has prohibited NHTSA from spending
any funds to consider changes to the CAFE standards.
Although that prohibition was lifted in December, the NHTSA
claims it has not had sufficient time to consider changes to
the standard. The NHTSA must issue its proposed rules
early enough to allow public comment and changes prior to a
final rulemaking, which must be issued by April 1st. The
public is invited to provide comments on the proposed fuel
efficiency standard before mid-February. See the January 18th
press release on the NHTSA Web site at:
<http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/nhtsa/announce/press/index.cfm>.

On January 14th, four days before the proposed standards
were released, the National Research Council (NRC) sent
NHTSA a report confirming the NRC's conclusions on CAFE
standards, originally released in a detailed report published
in July 2001. The reassessment was performed after the
initial report was challenged by the automotive industry. The
latest report reaffirms that ""technologies exist that, if applied
to passenger cars and light-duty trucks, would significantly
reduce fuel consumption within 15 years,"" and that
""assessment of currently offered product technologies
suggest that light-duty trucks, including SUVs, pickups, and
minivans, offer the greatest potential to reduce fuel
consumption..."" See the new report on the National
Academy Press Web site at:
<http://books.nap.edu/books/NI000377/html/R1.html>.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), the overall fuel economy of light vehicles -- including
both light trucks and cars -- is now at a 21-year low of
20.4 miles per gallon. Although car mileage has remained
essentially flat for the past 16 years and light truck mileage
has stayed largely unchanged for the past 20 years, the
growing market share of light trucks has dragged down the
overall fuel economy of light vehicles. See the EPA ""Light
Duty Automotive Technology and Fuel Economy Trends""
Web page at: <http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fetrends.htm>.

Note that actual fuel economies can be lower than the CAFE
standards for a number of reasons, including the fact that
manufacturers earn credits for any alternative-fuel vehicles
that they sell. Some manufacturers also fall below the
standards and pay penalties. To see how the details of how
manufacturers are meeting the standards, see the NHTSA
report on Model Year 2000 CAFE standards at:
<http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/studies/fuelecon/index.html>.


Real-World Test of Superconductor Cable Delayed

A test of a high-temperature superconductor (HTS) cable at
a Detroit Edison substation has been delayed indefinitely.
According to American Superconductor Corporation, which
made the HTS wires for the cables, a problem with the
vacuum insulating system used to help keep the cables cool
is preventing Detroit Edison from placing the HTS cables into
service. The company says the HTS wires met all their
performance requirements, and the vacuum insulating
technology is a proven technology that would not be
expected to hinder the future use of HTS cables. Pirelli
Energy Cables and Systems, the cable manufacturer, is
expected to issue a revised timetable for the demonstration
project in spring.

The Detroit Edison substation is the site of the first
installation and demonstration of an underground HTS cable
in a U.S. utility network. The utility installed three 400-foot
cables inside 4-inch-diameter underground ducts during the
summer of 2001. All other cable components, including the
cryogenic cooling and vacuum insulating systems, were
completed in the fall.

American Superconductor does have some good news,
though: its 5,000-horsepower HTS motor prototype, which
uses HTS wires in its rotor winding (the part of the motor that
rotates), was successfully tested at full load early this month.
The motor also successfully carried a peak load of 7,000
horsepower while running at its rated speed. Both the HTS
rotor coils and the refrigeration system met or exceeded their
performance goals, and the system as a whole operated at
an efficiency of 97.2 percent. The company claims it also
identified potential changes to the stator (the part of the
motor that stays still, or static) that could boost the efficiency
of the motor to 97.7 percent. See the American Superconductor
press releases at: <http://www.amsuper.com/press.htm>.


Report Questions Government Support for Renewable Energy

A report issued early this month by the Cato Institute, a
non-profit public policy research foundation, says that
government subsidies for renewable energy sources are
unwarranted. The report says that renewable energy is not
likely to gain significant market share in the foreseeable
future without a significant increase in government subsidies
or mandates. The report also claims that the environmental
benefits of renewable energy could be achieved more
cheaply using other technologies.

The report does acknowledge that government subsidies for
fully commercialized fossil energy technologies -- oil, coal,
and natural gas -- are nearly double those for renewable
energy, while nuclear and fossil fuels are also receiving
more research and development funds. It also suggests that
natural gas prices and availability will remain stable for the
foreseeable future. See the Cato Institute press release, with
a link to the full report, at:
<http://www.cato.org/new/01-02/01-08-02r-2.html>.

ENERGY FACTS AND TIPS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Report Claims Utilities are Struggling to Power Data Centers

A report issued last week suggests that electric utilities are
having a difficult time providing power to electronic data
centers, including so-called ""Internet hotels"" that provide
servers for Web sites. The Platts report finds that such data
centers can consume from 8 to 50 times the electricity per
square foot used by standard commercial buildings. For
instance, a 344,000-square-foot data center under
construction in Washington State is expected to draw up to
105 megawatts of power when it is complete. Such high
power loads are causing some data centers to develop their
own power sources. See the news release from Platts, one
of The McGraw-Hill Companies, at:
<http://www.platts.com/pressreleases/pressrelease2002-0118.shtml>.

The Platts report might be somewhat suspect, however, in
light of a report issued last summer by DOE's Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory (LBL). That report found that, for a
variety of reasons, data centers often greatly exaggerate
their power needs. It concluded that data centers use at
most 50 watts per square foot, and usually closer to 40 watts
per square foot. This number applies only to the computer
room part of the facility, and not surrounding office areas.
Using these figures, the data center in Washington would
need at most 17.2 megawatts of power -- probably much
less. See the August 29th edition of EREN Network News at:
<http://www.eren.doe.gov/newsletter/archives/2001/aug29_01.html>.

A report released last month by the Renewable Energy
Policy Project (REPP) suggests that energy use in data
centers could be even lower. Using efficient servers,
properly sized and efficient cooling systems, and other
energy efficiency approaches, data centers could reduce
their electricity demand by 20 to 50 percent, according to the
report. See the REPP announcement, with a link to the full
report, at:
<http://www.crest.org/articles/static/1/1008083982_982708646.html>.

"RE: Negawatts from Cogen","Bill,

I looked over the attached spreadsheet and have a couple of observations for you.

First, the analysis representing ""Existing Contract:  VAMC Cogen Project"" looks sound as far as coming up with rough numbers, however if a slightly different analysis would be need to be performed to arrive at the actual numbers.  I am not sure of the power prices that you used but I will assume that the numbers are accurate.

Second, the analysis representing ""New Energy and Water Conservation Project:  To be closed December 2001"" I know nothing about, therefore can't comment on such.

Richard,

Here is my first take on the analysis you wanted and acc't numbers.

Please do not show this to anyone before we talk.  I need to get to a meeting in Boston now so I don't have time to write something up which I need to do.  So please keep this just between us.  I'll call you this afternoon.

Ancillary Services Conference

 

April 10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado



OVERVIEW

 

As more and more regions in North America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both commerce and reliability. 

 

This conference will cover the key engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions, successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario, will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply these services.

 

The brochure for the Ancillary Services Conference, April 10-12, 2002, Wyndham Hotel - Tech Center, Denver, CO can be obtained by clicking on the link below:

Subject:	All-Employee Meeting

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"NJ Index plus","Following today's discussions with the Transaction Accounting group to discuss fixed basis Mark to Market, Product Management has modified the definition of the EESI Energy Price.   

The conclusion of the discussion with Transaction Accounting was that the Index product does in fact create a commodity position that the commodity desk can ""choose"" to manage.  The ""revenue"" position that is created when the contract is signed with the customer will be settled based on the published PJM Zone LMP, nevertheless the commodity desk may choose to manage their ""cost"" otherwise.  The proposed fixed basis will be treated as ONE with the index in determining the EESI Energy Price.   This approach is very similar in nature to the definition of the ""Plus"" that is defined in the ENovative Lite Energy Service Agreement for Gas products.  

Therefore, the EESI Energy Price will now read:

""""EESI Energy Price"" means the sum of the weighted average (weighted in accordance with the Account's hourly usage or the Utility rate class usage profile) of hourly Real Time Locational Marginal Price for the applicable Utility load zone as posted by the ISO plus $0.0[    ] per kWh.""

Please see the attached transaction confirmation and comment on the new definition of the fixed basis.  All references to the fixed basis (""Management Fee"")  as a separate component of the EESI Energy Price should be removed from the contract language.  


 

Please provide your comments accordingly.

Thanks

This conference will highlight the commonalties and common applications between the asset management processes used throughout the enterprise.  The conference will emphasize the need to link the physical power generation asset management processes to the activities and processes of the trading and marketing process.

Wake-up Call

Amid waning weekend demand and sagging spot gas values, Western peak power
prices fell for the Friday/Saturday combo.  Several players, however, were
surprised by the relative strength of the weekend package.  ""We were
expecting more of a downside in the dailies today, but who's complaining,""
said one seller.  While spot gas prices were heading lower on Thursday,
NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts were moving up, albeit slightly.  Gas
contracts for the front months rose on some late-session short covering, but
failed to make up for the more substantial losses that occurred on
Wednesday.  November Hub gas gained 6.8 cents to settle at 2.486$/mmBtu,
while December rose 9.7 cents to end at 2.8$/mmBtu.  On the national front,
a threat against the Three Mile Island nuclear plant served as a wake-up
call about the vulnerability of the nation's energy supplies.  Some U.S.
senators have urged that billions of dollars be spent to protect American
oil refineries, natural gas pipelines, hydropower dams, and nuclear power
plants.  ""The very word 'security' has changed dramatically where it's now
synonymous with anti-terrorism,"" said one source.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by an average of 1.25$/MWh for
the weekend package.  Lower demand and weaker spot gas values were the most
oft-cited explanations given for the softer dailies.  The spread between
peak and off-peak prices narrowed slightly on Thursday, and was expected to
shrink further, as fish mitigation procedures went into effect Wednesday
night.  The Vernita Bar operations, which are scheduled to last until
November 22, effectively reduce generation during the on-peak hours, while
beefing up generation over the off-peak hours.  Flow forecasts for Chief
Joseph came in at 60 kcfs Friday, 45 kcfs Saturday, 40 kcfs Sunday, 70 kcfs
Monday, and 65 kcfs next Tuesday through Thursday.  Weather forecasts for
the region's major load centers called for normal to slightly below-normal
temperatures into early next week.

California electricity prices for the Friday/Saturday package weakened in a
volatile day of trading on Thursday.  Some players were sitting on the
sidelines Thursday, one saying, ""I'm not buying in the dailies.  I think
real-time prices will be better [less expensive] over the weekend.""   In
other developments, the federal government reached an agreement with a
coalition of energy companies to build new transmission along Path 15.  The
new power lines were projected to cost $300 million and result in relief of
the current price-raising bottleneck during high demand times.  The new Path
15 would have a 1500 MW capacity.  In political news, California Governor
Davis hopped on the renegotiating-long-term-contracts bandwagon, much to the
relief of his fellow Democrats in the state legislature.  Renegotiation is
strongly opposed by the suppliers holding those contracts.  In unit news,
Alamitos #3 (320 MW), Encina #5 (332 MW), and Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) were
all back at full power on Thursday.  Daytime temperatures stayed in the
comfortable low-70s on Thursday, 5 to 10 degrees warmer across southern
inland regions, and were expected to stay within 2 to 3 degrees of normal
through Monday.  The latest six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures
from October 24 to 28.

Despite some unseasonably warm temperatures, heavy load energy costs in the
Southwest sunk for the Friday/Saturday duo.  Falling spot gas prices were
also given some of the credit for the weaker day-ahead market.  Peak power
at Palo Verde saw action between 25.5 and 28$/MWh, with the highest prices
heard late in the trading session.  In unit news, Four Corners #4 (750 MW)
returned to service following tube leak repairs that began last weekend, but
Arizona-based Coronado #2 (385 MW) was brought down for valve replacement
scheduled to last until Monday, October 22.  Weather forecasts called for
cooling on Sunday and Monday, but the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
predicting a return to above-normal temperatures from October 24 through 28.

___________________________________________________________
Spot power prices across the Eastern Interconnect mostly weakened in
Thursday trade, as expectations for warmer weather on Friday and into the
weekend took their toll on demand.  While Thursday remained cool, with
daytime temperatures 5 to 11 degrees below normal, Friday temperatures were
expected in the 60s and 70s across most of the regions.  Overnight lows were
expected to climb out of heating demand range by Saturday.  In more somber
news, Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island #1 (786 MW) heightened its already
stringent security measures in cooperation with state and federal
authorities, after a threat to the nuclear unit was received on Wednesday.
However, by Thursday the threat was deemed non-credible, and refueling
maintenance was allowed to continue.  NYMEX Henry Hub futures edged up on
Thursday, but reclaimed only a fraction of Wednesday's losses.  November
gained 6.8 cents to close at 2.486$/mmBtu, and December rose 9.7 cents to
end at 2.80$/mmBtu.

In the Mid-Atlantic, heavy load energy costs fell on Thursday, as off-line
generation declined for the third day in a row and weather forecasts for
Friday called for warming.  Western PJM goods were trading in a narrow range
from 25.25 to 25.5$/MWh, losing 1.5$/MWh off the high end, and 0.75$/MWh off
the low.  LMPs affected daily prices less on Thursday, fluctuating between
20 and 30$/MWh after the usual early morning spike.  Weather was cool, with
daytime highs only in the low-60s and overnight lows in the low-40s.
Temperatures were predicted to increase, reaching above-normal ranges for
the weekend and Monday.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for
below-normal temperatures for October 24 to 28.  On the unit front, there
were no new nuclear plants off-line, allowing Western PJM room to export
some surplus generation.

Peak power prices in the Midwest remained steady for most of the day, as
temperatures were expected to warm up through the weekend.  Into Cinergy
pieces traded in the range from 21.75 to 24$/MWh, climbing slightly to a day
ago.  The bulk of deals were completed between 22 and 22.5$/MWh, with the
24$/MWh seen very late in the trading session.  Loads were light on
Thursday, and expected to stay that way, with temperatures across the
regions warming over the weekend.  Above-normal temperatures were expected
by Sunday, continuing into Monday with daytime highs in the low-70s.  The
latest six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures for October 24 to 28.
Generation remained very healthy across ECAR on Thursday, but fall refueling
outages at Surry #1 (781 MW) and Fermi #2 (1,085 MW) were expected in the
near future.

Peak power prices in SERC lost ground on Thursday, as weather was expected
to warm back up for the weekend.  Daytime high temperatures in the
low-to-mid 60s were seen across most of the region, about 10 degrees below
normal, and expected to warm into the mid-to-upper 70s by Saturday.  The
most current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from October 24 to 28.
Into Entergy prices held steady, with goods changing hands from 20 to
21$/MWh, and the bulk of trades in the 20.25 to 20.50$/MWh range.  Into TVA
transacted between 22 and 23$/MWh.  No new information was available on
outages in the region.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Subject: 

The Agreements between Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Green Power Partners I LLC, are for a term endinging December 31, 2002.  The Agreement between Fetzer Vineyards and Enron Energy Services, Inc. is for a term ending April 30, 2002.  The Agreement between Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia) and Enron Energy Services, Inc. is for a term ending December 31, 2002.

Additionally,  Enron Energy Services, Inc. has entered into various agreement(s) with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. to sell additional ""green tickets"" from the Greeen Power Partners I LLC facilities in California:

EESI sells to EPMI, 1MW ATC, through December 31, 2001 (EPMI sells to EEMC)
EPMI sells to EEMC, 1MW ATC, through June 30, 2003
EESI sells to EPMI, 21 MW's, Sundays Off Peak, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)
EESI sells to EPMI, 14 MW's, Sundays ATC, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)

I do not know for sure how whether or not EPMI still plans to deliver to EEMC and/or LADWP, however if they plan to continue these sales and depending on our decision relative to Fetzer Vineyards and/or Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia), we may want to keep the Green Power Partners I LLC Agreement alive.  I have discussed the EPMI deals with LADWP with Chris Foster, EPMI Portland Office and am currently awaiting an answer from Chris as to the current status with LADWP.

Let me know if you have any questions.

In this case there is a product element because at least the 2 retail contracts I named require us to serve green. If we assume them, we have to have green to serve.

I thought the call on whether a contract is rejected was an economic call and not a product call.  If this is not the case then could we be forced to swallow the other discount off tariff contracts we  intend to reject?

Further, we need to know what the revenue is against this purchase to make a call on the economics.  

Richard - Do you have the Patagonia Contract? And/or any of the other green power transactions that EES has entered into with customer's?

Sounds like the economic justification for rejection is clear.  However, we need to be sure that we are not going to keep any customers where we have a contractual requirement to serve green power (Fetzer; Patagonia).  If we are comfortable that we are not, I think we can reject.

take a look at this. Unless there is a customer or regulatory reason to keep this, PPA, it would seem to me that we would want to reject this contract.

Murry,

Our forward curves show SP-15 power at $26.57/MWh for the period 02/01/2002-12/31/2002 (note that this does not include the discount for unit-contingency that usually accompanies wind power).  Green tags trade in the market for about $1.50/MWh.  Under the ""Green Tickets Sales Agreement"" it appears that EES has agreed to pay $39/MWh minus the market price of power, which is approximately $12/MWh for Green Tickets using our forward curves.

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Attached you will find two agreements EES has with ENRON Wind. 

1- Green Ticket Purchase Sale Agreement (PPA)
2- Scheduling Coordinator Service Agreement

With EES & ENA bankruptcy and the fact that Enron Wind has not been paid for the generation back to the month of November through current, Enron Wind is attempting to move their needs to APX for SC Services.  I also think they were looking for someone else to purchase their energy.  

I put a temporary stop on their actions but we are going to need to review these contracts to determine if we want to continue operating under them.

Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.

Thanks - MO

Ancillary Services Conference

 

April 10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado

 

OVERVIEW

 

As more and more regions in North America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both commerce and reliability. 

 

This conference will cover the key engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions, successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario, will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply these services.

 

The brochure for the Ancillary Services Conference, April 10-12, 2002, Wyndham Hotel - Tech Center, Denver, CO can be obtained by clicking on the link below:

http://www.euci.com/pdf/anc_svcs.pdf
