Fish, Potato Salad and Fun in abundance.


The perfect combination will take place on Feb 3rd at the Bledsoe residence.  We are combining a Fish Fry with the big game.  Due to the fantastic fishing the past few months the freezer is full of Trout and Redfish and it's time to make some room for the excellent fishing coming up in the next few months.  Please RSVP via email or call 281-855-4252 so we have an idea of how much fish to cook.  

Looking forward to seeing everyone and having fun with the football and commercials!

Peggy Mahoney asked me to forward this to you.

FYI - Here is a link to the Boston Globe article I have discussed with most of you. After numerous conversations and plenty of information proving otherwise, the reporter unfortunately decided to do this article based upon recent happenings. It is clearly a cheap shot.

 

On a happier note, here is a good article about our relationship with Quaker Oats in the Chicago Sun-Times.

 

Thanks,

Peggy

Mike,

The agreement covers multiple projects; to date there is only one project that has come on line.  For the one project that has come on line during the non-performance penalty could be in the range of $150,000 to $640,000, depending on the resoultion of the ""effective online date"" for said project.  The non-performance penalty was our strongest negotiating point in the ongoing effort to restructure the agreement as there is a potential for penalties for each project for each year of the contract.  The agreement contained some fundamenal flaws in order to be able to book the mark-to-market for the agreement.  

I do not have a good handle of the ""early termination payment"" except to say that there are approxmiately 390,500 MWh's.  The average contract ""fixed price"" is $33.10 MWh.  I would need to find out what the nine year fixed price from the power curves is to estimate but my best stab would be to estimate the nine year fixed price to be $25.00 MWh which would result in ""early termination payment"" of approximately $3,200,000 ((390,500*33.10) - (390,500*25.00)).

Mike,

The ""deal"" is between EESI and Riverside County Waste Management Department (RCWMC) is dated April 17, 2000 and the term commenced on Sepetmber 1, 2000 and ending on September 1, 2010.  Based on our bankruptcy filing RCWMD stopped delivery of power on December 6, 2001; RCWMD invoiced EESI for power production for September 2001, 0ctober 2001 and November 2001.  I do not know if they were ever paid by EESI.  I do not know of any invoice for the first six days of December 2001.

EESI (myself) and EPMI (Chris Foster) were in the process of renegotiating the above referenced agreement with the plan for EPMI to take over the purchase of power and scheduling services with EESI being the purchaser of the ""green tickets""  from EPMI associated with the power production.  There were some major issues to overcome in the renegotiation regarding the ""fixed price"", ""volume committments"" and ""penalties"".  I do not know who, if anyone, is currently looking at this agreement to make any kind of determination EESI's and/or EPMI's desires for the future of this agreement.  

RCWMD sent various letters dated December 10, 2001, December 13, 2001, and January 8, 2002 requesting response from EESI.  The December 10, 2001 letter indicates that RCWMD considers the agreement terminated effective December 2, 2001.  I had previously spoke to you about this agreement in December 2001.  

It is my opinion that we should not continue this agreement and we should consider RCWMD's offer to terminate the agreement with the exchange of the non-performance panalties for the termination payment.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,

Richard

Rogers,

Enron Energy Services, Inc. (""EESI"") submitted application to become a NEPOOL member, to be effective January 1, 2000.  EESI was approved by the NEPOOL Participants Membership Subcommittee at its January 24, 2000 meeting.  One requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Policy for NEPOOL Members.  EESI, Enron Energy Marketing Corp, and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the Financial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bond(s), rather than corporate guaranty, due to Enron's disagreement with the Form of Corporate Guaranty required by NEPOOL.

EESI, via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, issued a Performance Bond in the amount of $8,000,000 in June 2000; the Performance Bond was reissued in June 2001 in the amount of $8,000,000.  EESI received a letter from ISO New England dated October 10, 2001, addressed to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements) and received by Becky probably October 12, 2001, indicating that EESI's current Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase the amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  Becky delivered the October 10th letter  to my attention whereby I took the letter to EESI Legal Department (Karen Cordova) and informed Karen that EESI needed to increase the Performance Bond to $20,000,000.  Karen requested Credit Department (Nichole Gunter) initiate an increase in the Performance Bond to the $20,000,000 level; to the best of my knowledge the initial conversation with Credit Department was October 12, 2001.  In telephone conversations with ISO-NE, Enron's Credit Department personnel were informed by ISO-NE that in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be resolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (October 19, 2001), however the letter did not indicate such. 

I was notified by Credit Department on October 16, 2001 that the bond company Enron utilizes for performance bond(s) would not process our Performance Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstanding invoices for ""other"" performance bonds (bond  renewals), approximately $150,000.  The ""other"" performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI, since June 2001, to various individuals (i.e. Greg Sharp, Mark Mueller, Jeff Golden, Scott Mills) and had still remained unpaid.  Payments for the ""other"" performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our request for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, which was issued by the bond company on October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on October 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE on October 23, 2001.  EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond company as mentioned above.  Credit Department personnel informed ISO-NE personnel that EESI would not meet the October 19, 2001 deadline, but was working diligently to resolve the matter; Credit Department personnel sent via FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Performance Bond to ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001.  

I notified Dan Allegretti, (Enron Government Affairs & Chariman, NEPOOL Participants Committee) of the entire situation prior to October 19, 2001.  Dan indicated that he did not think there would be any problems, but to get the matter resolved as quickly as possible. Dan advised me that the implications of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to the Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published, the following month, EESI would no longer be listed as being in default.  On October 19, 2001 another letter was sent to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements) from Edward McKenna, Vice President & Chief Financial Officer informing EESI that ""Enron Energy Services, Inc. has not maintained the required level of financial assurance for 10 days or more, and has had a total combination of 3 financial assurance and/or payment defaults in the last 12 months, which qualifies them as having 2 (two) Level 1 defaults.  The ISO has been in contact with Enron Energy Services, Inc. through multiple telephone communications, and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured.  Therefore, per the established procedure, we are forwarding this information to the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action by them.""  According to Dan Allegretti the Memberhsip Subcommittee reports to him, as Chariman of the Members Subcommittee, and he would discuss the issue with them.  The previous two Financial Assurance Defaults mentioned the October 19, 2001 letter occurred (i) December 2000, when payment was received 1-2 days late and was automatically resolved when payment was received and (ii) September 2001, when Financial Assurance Default occurred and was resolved through market activity.  To the best of my knowledge, EESI was unaware of either the December 2000 Payment Default or the September 2001 Financial Assurance Default, and no information was received by EESI from ISO-NE relative to either incidence.

According to (i) Protocal for the Initation of Membership Termination Proceedings and (ii) conversations with Dan Allegretti, the issue should be resolved with the receipt on October 24, 2001 of the Performance Bond by ISO-NE.  I have also advised the ISO-NE, in the future, to send communications to EESI's Credit Department and not EESI's Settlements.  Also, Dan Allegretti is investigating the facts leading the the October 19, 2001 letter with representatives from ISO-NE.

I left message for Molly Harris as you requested. I was able to speak to Denise Furey and Nichole Gunter, who both indicated that they would speak with Molly as they all work together.  

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Richard

From: 	EES Distribution,   On Behalf Of EES Office of Chairman,
Sent:	Wednesday, October 24, 2001 2:59 PM

Subject:	Organizational Changes

Re: Organizational Changes

Over the last several quarters, EES has successfully implemented a number of new business models, organizational structures and processes.  The result has been tremendous customer contracting in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe in 2001.  In all cases, EES's large consumer market share has expanded and we have rapidly increased our market penetration in the small consumer market - Enron Direct.  This effort, in itself is impressive, especially given that at the same time, EES has had to significantly restructure and re-tool its execution capabilities, systems and mid and back offices.  I can assure you that these processes, systems and capabilities are improving.  This is only the result of a lot of hard work from back to front across EES, EES risk and Enron Networks.

In that light, I am pleased to announce a number of organizational changes which demonstrate our continued commitment to the European market and the creation of a new exciting channel in the Enron Direct USA business.

A)	EES Europe:

Effective immediately, Sean Holmes will be moving to London to manage EES Europe.  We believe that Sean has the broad based experience in the EES business model, products, retail energy risk management and demand side management to take the European business to next level. Charlie Crossley-Cooke will manage our small consumer (Enron Direct) franchise.  This franchise has continued to grow, in the UK and on the continent, and has provided significant income to EES in 2001. Enron Direct will also continue to provide mid and back office services to EES Europe. Paul Turner will manage our large consumer business in Western Europe.  Paul will be replacing Stuart Rexrode who will be returning to EES in Houston.  Over the last few quarters, our penetration of this market, primarily in the UK, has grown dramatically with completed contracts with Sainsbury, Guiness, Kraft and Pirelli.  Many of these transactions include gas, power and demand side management.  We would like to thank Stuart for all his hard work toward the continued growth of the European franchise.

We are also pleased to announce the formation of the European Product Group led by Roy Poyntz.  This group will lead the development of new products and services for both the large and small consumer markets.  As in North America, its main role will be to ensure viable and innovative products are continually available in the pipeline to ensure the continued growth of the European business. The Product Group will also ensure product diversity between gas, power and energy efficiency products.  We continue to be committed to the development of the demand side management aspects of our business to differentiate us from our competitors. On a final note, the EES Europe commodity structuring and DSM groups will now report to Sean in addition to Charlie, Paul and Roy. 

As part of this change, Deb Merrill will be assuming the lead role in Deal Management in EES USA replacing Sean.  Deb has been an integral part of EES from many years and we believe she has all the experience and skill sets to effectively manage and build on this integral function in EES USA.

B)	Enron Direct USA - Dealer Network

Effective immediately, Stuart Rexrode will manage this new sales channel inside Enron Direct USA.  Stuart will be building this new more sophisticated agent selling channel by creating franchise like relationships with numerous ""dealers"" across the US.  This dealer network will consist of small knowledgeable entrepreneurs and consultants that have been in the energy markets for many years and have great regional expertise and customer relationships. EES will provide a franchise like program where we provide resources and products to this agent base in exchange for exclusive provision of sales services and customer aggregation.  We hope that this network can provide the customer acquisition velocity and low cost acquisition model benefits of the mass market agents but provide a more sophisticated agent in front of larger clients in order to sell higher value products that include gas, power and DSM.  Phyllis Anzalone and her team are already working on the development of this dealer network and will become part of this group reporting to Stuart.  Phyllis and her team deserve a lot of credit for the identification and build out to date of this newest business model in EES.

In conclusion, everyday we are getting better and more effective.  We should be very pleased with the financial and operating performance of EES for 2001.  We have an EBIT target of $75 million for Q4 which is only $4 million higher than Q3, We will finish the year at approximately $247 million.  This is approximately 10% over 2001 plan and 120% growth in recurring earnings year on year.  The business model is working and we are one step closer to the goal of becoming the leading global energy retailer.  The All-Employee meeting will be on November 1 where we look forward to discussing with you our operational and financial results for 2001 and our plan, strategies and objectives for 2002.

"RE: Riverside County Waste Mgt","Mike,

The ""deal"" is between EESI and Riverside County Waste Management Department (RCWMC) is dated April 17, 2000 and the term commenced on Sepetmber 1, 2000 and ending on September 1, 2010.  Based on our bankruptcy filing RCWMD stopped delivery of power on December 6, 2001; RCWMD invoiced EESI for power production for September 2001, 0ctober 2001 and November 2001.  I do not know if they were ever paid by EESI.  I do not know of any invoice for the first six days of December 2001.

EESI (myself) and EPMI (Chris Foster) were in the process of renegotiating the above referenced agreement with the plan for EPMI to take over the purchase of power and scheduling services with EESI being the purchaser of the ""green tickets""  from EPMI associated with the power production.  There were some major issues to overcome in the renegotiation regarding the ""fixed price"", ""volume committments"" and ""penalties"".  I do not know who, if anyone, is currently looking at this agreement to make any kind of determination EESI's and/or EPMI's desires for the future of this agreement.  

RCWMD sent various letters dated December 10, 2001, December 13, 2001, and January 8, 2002 requesting response from EESI.  The December 10, 2001 letter indicates that RCWMD considers the agreement terminated effective December 2, 2001.  I had previously spoke to you about this agreement in December 2001.  

It is my opinion that we should not continue this agreement and we should consider RCWMD's offer to terminate the agreement with the exchange of the non-performance panalties for the termination payment.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,

Richard

Based on our conversation it looks like Kinko's would be interested in purchasing approximately 8,800 MWh's per year for a three year term (approximately 26,500 MWh's) over the term of the deal.  Our offer price for Texas Renewable Energy Credits (sourced from within the State of Texas) would remain at $6.00 MWh.

"RE: Riverside County Waste Mgt","Mike,

The agreement covers multiple projects; to date there is only one project that has come on line.  For the one project that has come on line during the non-performance penalty could be in the range of $150,000 to $640,000, depending on the resoultion of the ""effective online date"" for said project.  The non-performance penalty was our strongest negotiating point in the ongoing effort to restructure the agreement as there is a potential for penalties for each project for each year of the contract.  The agreement contained some fundamenal flaws in order to be able to book the mark-to-market for the agreement.  

I do not have a good handle of the ""early termination payment"" except to say that there are approxmiately 390,500 MWh's.  The average contract ""fixed price"" is $33.10 MWh.  I would need to find out what the nine year fixed price from the power curves is to estimate but my best stab would be to estimate the nine year fixed price to be $25.00 MWh which would result in ""early termination payment"" of approximately $3,200,000 ((390,500*33.10) - (390,500*25.00)).

"RE: Riverside Contract Draft","Chris,

I have reviewed the Confirmation Letter and have the following comments and/or questions:
PREAMBLE
PARAGRAPH ONE
Company name should be Riverside County Waste Management Department.

PREAMBLE
PARAGRAPH TWO
There are various references to ""this SC Agreement"", which is not a defined term anywhere; should the reference to ""this SC Agreement"" really mean ""this Confirmation Letter"" or ""this Master Agreement""?

ARTICLE 2
SECTION 2.1 has a reference to SCE1 which appears to be different that the reference to the Delivery Point, which is defined as SP-15?
SECTION 2.2 has a reference to to Attachment 1and there is no Attachment 1.
SECTION 2.4 (v) was deleted and SECTION 2.4 (vi) was renumbered as SECTION 2.4 (v).
SECTIOM 2.4 (v) indicates that the Index Price shall be the Dow Jones Index NP-15; why is this the case when earlier in SECTION 2.1 the Delivery Point is defined as SP-15?  The last sentence indicates a name of ""Hanson"" which I believe should really be ""RCWMD"".
SECTION 2.5 again has reference to ""this SC Agreement"", which I believe should be ""this Confirmation Letter"" or ""this Master Agreement"".  Also, there is a reference to ""RCWMD's usage"", shouldn't the terminology in the case of this contract be ""production"" and ""deliveries""?

ARTICLE 3
SECTION 3.1 should have the following added to the beginning of the sentence ""RCWMD"".
SECTION 3.2 again refers to terminology ""energy deliveries and usage"" which I believe should be ""energy production and deliveries"".

ARTICLE 4
SECTION 4.2 refers to ""consumed"" which I believe should be ""delivered"" or ""produced"".
SECTION 4.5 has a reference to Attachment 2 and there is no Attachment 2.  There is again a reference to ""receive"" and ""consume"" which should probably be ""deliver"" and ""consume"".
SECTIOM 4.7 refers to ""Term Purchase"", which is not a defined term, at least in the Confirmation Letter.  There is also a reference to Exhibit A and there is no Exhibit A; we previously referred to Attachments rather than Exhibits so we need to make sure that we are consistent.

ARTICLE 5
SECTION 5.1 contains language regarding Scheduling Coordination services, is this fee normal and did you intend for it to be included in this contract.

ARTICLE 6
SECTION 6.1 contains reference to ""this SC Agreement"", which I believe should be ""this Confirmation Letter"" or ""this Master Agreement"".
SECTION 6.2 contains reference to ""this Agreement"", which I believe should be ""this Confirmation Letter"" or ""this Master Agreement"".
SECTION 6.6 contains reference to ""this Agreement"", which I believe should be ""this Confirmation Letter"" or ""this Master Agreement"".
SECTION 6.8 contains reference to ""Schdule ____"", which appears to be absent.

When you get this e-mail lets talk about the comments.  I would like to have a conference call with Riverside on Wednesday October 31st.

Regards,

Richard

"RE: Green Power Partners","The Agreements between Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Green Power Partners I LLC, are for a term endinging December 31, 2002.  The Agreement between Fetzer Vineyards and Enron Energy Services, Inc. is for a term ending April 30, 2002.  The Agreement between Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia) and Enron Energy Services, Inc. is for a term ending December 31, 2002.

Additionally,  Enron Energy Services, Inc. has entered into various agreement(s) with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. to sell additional ""green tickets"" from the Greeen Power Partners I LLC facilities in California:

EESI sells to EPMI, 1MW ATC, through December 31, 2001 (EPMI sells to EEMC)
EPMI sells to EEMC, 1MW ATC, through June 30, 2003
EESI sells to EPMI, 21 MW's, Sundays Off Peak, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)
EESI sells to EPMI, 14 MW's, Sundays ATC, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)

I do not know for sure how whether or not EPMI still plans to deliver to EEMC and/or LADWP, however if they plan to continue these sales and depending on our decision relative to Fetzer Vineyards and/or Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia), we may want to keep the Green Power Partners I LLC Agreement alive.  I have discussed the EPMI deals with LADWP with Chris Foster, EPMI Portland Office and am currently awaiting an answer from Chris as to the current status with LADWP.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I thought the call on whether a contract is rejected was an economic call and not a product call.  If this is not the case then could we be forced to swallow the other discount off tariff contracts we  intend to reject?

Further, we need to know what the revenue is against this purchase to make a call on the economics.  

Richard - Do you have the Patagonia Contract? And/or any of the other green power transactions that EES has entered into with customer's?

Sounds like the economic justification for rejection is clear.  However, we need to be sure that we are not going to keep any customers where we have a contractual requirement to serve green power (Fetzer; Patagonia).  If we are comfortable that we are not, I think we can reject.

take a look at this. Unless there is a customer or regulatory reason to keep this, PPA, it would seem to me that we would want to reject this contract.

Murry,

Our forward curves show SP-15 power at $26.57/MWh for the period 02/01/2002-12/31/2002 (note that this does not include the discount for unit-contingency that usually accompanies wind power).  Green tags trade in the market for about $1.50/MWh.  Under the ""Green Tickets Sales Agreement"" it appears that EES has agreed to pay $39/MWh minus the market price of power, which is approximately $12/MWh for Green Tickets using our forward curves.

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Attached you will find two agreements EES has with ENRON Wind. 

1- Green Ticket Purchase Sale Agreement (PPA)
2- Scheduling Coordinator Service Agreement

With EES & ENA bankruptcy and the fact that Enron Wind has not been paid for the generation back to the month of November through current, Enron Wind is attempting to move their needs to APX for SC Services.  I also think they were looking for someone else to purchase their energy.  

I put a temporary stop on their actions but we are going to need to review these contracts to determine if we want to continue operating under them.

Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.

"RE: ma rps","Stacey,
 
Elliot and I would like to discuss a few issues with you regarding the MS RPS Comments.  What time do you think that you will have to discuss?
 
 
<http://www.energy.ca.gov/renewables/documents/index.html#greenpower>
 
 
 
F-1:  Need to require that all current renewable facilities, including all current existing boimass facilities are certified prior to the start date RPS
 
F-5:  Not sure that I understand the issue surrounding compliance on a product level - let's discuss
 
F-7:  While we are very pleased with the Division's inclusion of banking, we do not understand the need to restrict the limit on how much Supplier's are allowed to bank as the shelf life for Renewable Energy Credits is already limited to the two compliance periods immediately following.  We would also ask that you not limit the ability for Suppliers to transfer banked Renewable Energy Credits during the allowed compliance periods.  We feel that the Division should encourage as much liquidity as possible in the Renewable Energy Credit market.  We understand the Division's concern regarding transferable banking and potential problems with market power, however, we feel that the GIS Administrator is charged with closely monitoring potential market power situations.  We would prefer that the Renewable Energy Credit market be allowed to operate as indicated above from the beginning and if it is determined that market power issues exist then appropriate changes to the market can and should be implemented.  We feel that markets operate best with few restrictions.  
 
F-9: Section 4. Not sure I understand the difference between the percentage of sales versus the actual MWh's - let's discuss
 
F-9: Section 5. Not sure that this language makes sense - let's discuss

"RE: Green Power Partners","Deb,

Attached is a spreadsheet that shows my analysis of the Enron Wind Development Corp (Green Power Partners) contract(s).  The asumptions contained in the analysis assume that the following contracts remain in effect through December 31, 2002:

EESI's sale agreement with Lost Arrow, Inc. (Green Power Partners) and Patagonia
EESI's sale to EPMI for resale to EEMC (1MW ATC)
EESI's sale to EPMI for resale to LADWP(1) (21MW Sundays Off Peak)
EESI's sale to EPMI for resale to LADWP(2) (14MW Sundays ATC)
EESI's sale to various retail small commercial customers and Fetzer Vineyards

Let me know if you need any additional information.

The Agreements between Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Green Power Partners I LLC, are for a term endinging December 31, 2002.  The Agreement between Fetzer Vineyards and Enron Energy Services, Inc. is for a term ending April 30, 2002.  The Agreement between Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia) and Enron Energy Services, Inc. is for a term ending December 31, 2002.

Additionally,  Enron Energy Services, Inc. has entered into various agreement(s) with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. to sell additional ""green tickets"" from the Greeen Power Partners I LLC facilities in California:

EESI sells to EPMI, 1MW ATC, through December 31, 2001 (EPMI sells to EEMC)
EPMI sells to EEMC, 1MW ATC, through June 30, 2003
EESI sells to EPMI, 21 MW's, Sundays Off Peak, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)
EESI sells to EPMI, 14 MW's, Sundays ATC, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)

I do not know for sure how whether or not EPMI still plans to deliver to EEMC and/or LADWP, however if they plan to continue these sales and depending on our decision relative to Fetzer Vineyards and/or Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia), we may want to keep the Green Power Partners I LLC Agreement alive.  I have discussed the EPMI deals with LADWP with Chris Foster, EPMI Portland Office and am currently awaiting an answer from Chris as to the current status with LADWP.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I thought the call on whether a contract is rejected was an economic call and not a product call.  If this is not the case then could we be forced to swallow the other discount off tariff contracts we  intend to reject?

Further, we need to know what the revenue is against this purchase to make a call on the economics.  

Richard - Do you have the Patagonia Contract? And/or any of the other green power transactions that EES has entered into with customer's?

Sounds like the economic justification for rejection is clear.  However, we need to be sure that we are not going to keep any customers where we have a contractual requirement to serve green power (Fetzer; Patagonia).  If we are comfortable that we are not, I think we can reject.

Murry,

Our forward curves show SP-15 power at $26.57/MWh for the period 02/01/2002-12/31/2002 (note that this does not include the discount for unit-contingency that usually accompanies wind power).  Green tags trade in the market for about $1.50/MWh.  Under the ""Green Tickets Sales Agreement"" it appears that EES has agreed to pay $39/MWh minus the market price of power, which is approximately $12/MWh for Green Tickets using our forward curves.

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Attached you will find two agreements EES has with ENRON Wind. 

1- Green Ticket Purchase Sale Agreement (PPA)
2- Scheduling Coordinator Service Agreement

With EES & ENA bankruptcy and the fact that Enron Wind has not been paid for the generation back to the month of November through current, Enron Wind is attempting to move their needs to APX for SC Services.  I also think they were looking for someone else to purchase their energy.  

I put a temporary stop on their actions but we are going to need to review these contracts to determine if we want to continue operating under them.

Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.

Thanks - MO

Mike,

The agreement covers multiple projects; to date there is only one project that has come on line.  For the one project that has come on line during the non-performance penalty could be in the range of $150,000 to $640,000, depending on the resoultion of the ""effective online date"" for said project.  The non-performance penalty was our strongest negotiating point in the ongoing effort to restructure the agreement as there is a potential for penalties for each project for each year of the contract.  The agreement contained some fundamenal flaws in order to be able to book the mark-to-market for the agreement.  

I do not have a good handle of the ""early termination payment"" except to say that there are approxmiately 390,500 MWh's.  The average contract ""fixed price"" is $33.10 MWh.  I would need to find out what the nine year fixed price from the power curves is to estimate but my best stab would be to estimate the nine year fixed price to be $25.00 MWh which would result in ""early termination payment"" of approximately $3,200,000 ((390,500*33.10) - (390,500*25.00)).

Mike,

The ""deal"" is between EESI and Riverside County Waste Management Department (RCWMC) is dated April 17, 2000 and the term commenced on Sepetmber 1, 2000 and ending on September 1, 2010.  Based on our bankruptcy filing RCWMD stopped delivery of power on December 6, 2001; RCWMD invoiced EESI for power production for September 2001, 0ctober 2001 and November 2001.  I do not know if they were ever paid by EESI.  I do not know of any invoice for the first six days of December 2001.

EESI (myself) and EPMI (Chris Foster) were in the process of renegotiating the above referenced agreement with the plan for EPMI to take over the purchase of power and scheduling services with EESI being the purchaser of the ""green tickets""  from EPMI associated with the power production.  There were some major issues to overcome in the renegotiation regarding the ""fixed price"", ""volume committments"" and ""penalties"".  I do not know who, if anyone, is currently looking at this agreement to make any kind of determination EESI's and/or EPMI's desires for the future of this agreement.  

RCWMD sent various letters dated December 10, 2001, December 13, 2001, and January 8, 2002 requesting response from EESI.  The December 10, 2001 letter indicates that RCWMD considers the agreement terminated effective December 2, 2001.  I had previously spoke to you about this agreement in December 2001.  

It is my opinion that we should not continue this agreement and we should consider RCWMD's offer to terminate the agreement with the exchange of the non-performance panalties for the termination payment.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,

Richard

Kathleen Croissett, Enron Wind Development Company, had contacted me asking me whether or not the agreement(s) were terminated.  EESI did not terminate the agreement(s) and EESI had not received any termination notices from Green Power Partners which is why I was trying to find out from you what you knew regarding the delivery of power from such facilities.

Late Friday I received a call from Lisa Pitts, Enron Wind Development Corp, however she did particularly say what she wanted.  I did leave a voice mail message for Lisa Pitts, however as of yet have not received a call back from her.

Murry,

Our forward curves show SP-15 power at $26.57/MWh for the period 02/01/2002-12/31/2002 (note that this does not include the discount for unit-contingency that usually accompanies wind power).  Green tags trade in the market for about $1.50/MWh.  Under the ""Green Tickets Sales Agreement"" it appears that EES has agreed to pay $39/MWh minus the market price of power, which is approximately $12/MWh for Green Tickets using our forward curves.

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Todd

Attached you will find two agreements EES has with ENRON Wind. 

1- Green Ticket Purchase Sale Agreement (PPA)
2- Scheduling Coordinator Service Agreement

With EES & ENA bankruptcy and the fact that Enron Wind has not been paid for the generation back to the month of November through current, Enron Wind is attempting to move their needs to APX for SC Services.  I also think they were looking for someone else to purchase their energy.  

I put a temporary stop on their actions but we are going to need to review these contracts to determine if we want to continue operating under them.

Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.

Thanks - MO

Tina - Please move Richard Ring to ECN 623a.  Liqun Pan is also on the fifth floor in ECS.  You can move her to ECN 680a.  Oliver Jones has already communicated his move location to the move team.  

If you have questions call me at x.35330.

Richard, Rick, and Paul:

Can you please go scope out a spot on 6 in ECN as soon as possible (today).  Please notify Tina Holcombe of the location so that she can designate for the upcoming churn (computer and telephone move). Once on ECN6 Deb will work to finalize a permanent floor plan.

Deb - Richard is out today.  Could you please locate a spot for him and notify Tina.  Deb - also, if Liqun Pan, Oliver Jones and others have already moved to ECN 6 and still have phone lines and computers in ECS 5 you may want to forward their info (locations - old and present) so that they can be included on this churn as well. 

Thanks everyone,
Rogers
