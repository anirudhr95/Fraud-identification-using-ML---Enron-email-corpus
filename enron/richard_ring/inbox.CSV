"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.

"Organizational Changes","Re: Organizational Changes

Over the last several quarters, EES has successfully implemented a number of new business models, organizational structures and processes.  The result has been tremendous customer contracting in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe in 2001.  In all cases, EES's large consumer market share has expanded and we have rapidly increased our market penetration in the small consumer market - Enron Direct.  This effort, in itself is impressive, especially given that at the same time, EES has had to significantly restructure and re-tool its execution capabilities, systems and mid and back offices.  I can assure you that these processes, systems and capabilities are improving.  This is only the result of a lot of hard work from back to front across EES, EES risk and Enron Networks.

In that light, I am pleased to announce a number of organizational changes which demonstrate our continued commitment to the European market and the creation of a new exciting channel in the Enron Direct USA business.

A)	EES Europe:

Effective immediately, Sean Holmes will be moving to London to manage EES Europe.  We believe that Sean has the broad based experience in the EES business model, products, retail energy risk management and demand side management to take the European business to next level. Charlie Crossley-Cooke will manage our small consumer (Enron Direct) franchise.  This franchise has continued to grow, in the UK and on the continent, and has provided significant income to EES in 2001. Enron Direct will also continue to provide mid and back office services to EES Europe. Paul Turner will manage our large consumer business in Western Europe.  Paul will be replacing Stuart Rexrode who will be returning to EES in Houston.  Over the last few quarters, our penetration of this market, primarily in the UK, has grown dramatically with completed contracts with Sainsbury, Guiness, Kraft and Pirelli.  Many of these transactions include gas, power and demand side management.  We would like to thank Stuart for all his hard work toward the continued growth of the European franchise.

We are also pleased to announce the formation of the European Product Group led by Roy Poyntz.  This group will lead the development of new products and services for both the large and small consumer markets.  As in North America, its main role will be to ensure viable and innovative products are continually available in the pipeline to ensure the continued growth of the European business. The Product Group will also ensure product diversity between gas, power and energy efficiency products.  We continue to be committed to the development of the demand side management aspects of our business to differentiate us from our competitors. On a final note, the EES Europe commodity structuring and DSM groups will now report to Sean in addition to Charlie, Paul and Roy. 

As part of this change, Deb Merrill will be assuming the lead role in Deal Management in EES USA replacing Sean.  Deb has been an integral part of EES from many years and we believe she has all the experience and skill sets to effectively manage and build on this integral function in EES USA.

B)	Enron Direct USA - Dealer Network

Effective immediately, Stuart Rexrode will manage this new sales channel inside Enron Direct USA.  Stuart will be building this new more sophisticated agent selling channel by creating franchise like relationships with numerous ""dealers"" across the US.  This dealer network will consist of small knowledgeable entrepreneurs and consultants that have been in the energy markets for many years and have great regional expertise and customer relationships. EES will provide a franchise like program where we provide resources and products to this agent base in exchange for exclusive provision of sales services and customer aggregation.  We hope that this network can provide the customer acquisition velocity and low cost acquisition model benefits of the mass market agents but provide a more sophisticated agent in front of larger clients in order to sell higher value products that include gas, power and DSM.  Phyllis Anzalone and her team are already working on the development of this dealer network and will become part of this group reporting to Stuart.  Phyllis and her team deserve a lot of credit for the identification and build out to date of this newest business model in EES.

In conclusion, everyday we are getting better and more effective.  We should be very pleased with the financial and operating performance of EES for 2001.  We have an EBIT target of $75 million for Q4 which is only $4 million higher than Q3, We will finish the year at approximately $247 million.  This is approximately 10% over 2001 plan and 120% growth in recurring earnings year on year.  The business model is working and we are one step closer to the goal of becoming the leading global energy retailer.  The All-Employee meeting will be on November 1 where we look forward to discussing with you our operational and financial results for 2001 and our plan, strategies and objectives for 2002.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"Re: NJ Index plus","Please see attached.  I am offering up some expanded language around the index we use so that it is more clear.  If we settle on that language, the spot energy price may need to be modified accordingly.  I am trying to make this consistent with the NY offering, which is similar in terms of how the index based price will work and what the basis will include.  

I am not convinced that we can't express the basis as the ""Fixed Basis"" rather than a plug number in the EESI Energy Price definition, so I have left it the way it was.  I am also not convinced that we can do away with excess and deficiency usage calculations during the index period.

I have added in the option to fix language, but I am not sure it is necessary or desirable to have it.  It is really an optic (customers always have the right to request a restructured price) and I'm not sure there is any reason to offer it in our form unless origination has as strong market-based reason to do so.

"","Per our conversation, BGE is implementing a fee (eff. 7/1/02) referenced in the BGE Electricity Supplier Manual (pg. 32) , as follows:

	""Charges for Coordination Services provided under this Tariff and Supplier Coordination Agreement""


The fee will be invoiced to us monthly, and is distinguishable from the forecasting and scheduling services the desk provides, and for which .25 per MWh has been included in your deal costs.  BGE defines the Scheduling Coordinator as:

""An entity recognized the the PJM OI and qualified to act on behalf of the Electricity Supplier in taking such actions with PJM as are necessary in order for Electricity Supplier's obligations as defined in this Tariff to be met, including the submission of energy schedules to the PJM OI. and that either is (1) a member of the PJM interconnection, L.L.C., or (2) the PJM-approved agent for scheduling purposes, of one or more Electricity Suppliers that are members of the PJM Interconnection, L.L.C.""


Per Schedule 1 in the same document, the fee will be:

	""$30/MW/month...Based on the average daily Electricity Supplier's MW peak load contribution for the month""

This calculates to approximately .063 per MWh based on an assumed 65% load factor (.041 at 100% load).


Although the BGE TC for the Index product (Page 1, PRICE, Bullet 2.) specifies that the customer will be responsible to pay or reimburse us for all ""Special Utility Charges"" as further defined in the Master Agreement, this is going to be a recurring, ongoing charge rather than a special charge.

We therefore believe that this charge is more appropriately a component of the EESI Energy Price as defined in the TC, and recommend that the definition be modified to include the BGE Coordination Services Charge as defined in the BGE Electricity Supplier Manual.  This charge would then be allocated to the customers based on total monthly load (as are several of the ISO charges).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

"Re: NJ Index plus","From a mark to market perspective, the fixed basis as it is defined in the MD and NJ Index products include deal costs which are not considered market related, thus MTM accounting rules do not apply.  By defining the index as PJM plus $0.0[   ] per kWh, we effectively tie the deal cost to the index and mark the transactions accordingly.  Please see my note previous note on this issue.  

""""EESI Energy Price"" means the sum of the weighted average (weighted in accordance with the Account's hourly usage or the Utility rate class usage profile) of hourly Real Time Locational Marginal Price for the applicable Utility load zone as posted by the ISO plus $0.0[    ] per kWh.""

All references to the fixed basis as a separate component of the EESI Energy Price should be removed from the contract language.  

I have also changed the Contract Price language so that the incentive is given to the customer on his actual usage up to anticipated usage: 

"" For each Billing Cycle from the commencement of the Transaction Term through July 31, 2003, an amount equal to what the Utility Invoice would have been for such Account had you purchased the Account's Actual Usage from the Utility under the Prevailing Utility Tariff Rate, minus, $0.0[   ] per kWh of Actual Usage up to the Anticipated Usage.  You will also be responsible for and pay, or reimburse us if we have paid, Special Utility Charges (to the extent not already included in the Prevailing Utility Tariff Rate) and Taxes.""

Language that describes the customers ""option"" to enter a fixed price agreement with EES is also necessary:

To the extent a Fixed Energy Price has not already been agreed to, you may request that we provide a fixed price quote for energy to replace the EESI Energy Price (a Fixed Energy Price) by contacting us between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., central time, of any Business Day requesting a quote for such Fixed Energy Price; Upon receipt of your request, we will notify you of the Fixed Energy Price, the length of time you have to either accept or reject the Fixed Energy Price and any additional credit terms or other contractual terms relative to such Fixed Energy Price.  If you accept such Fixed Energy Price within the specified time, we will send to you for your execution a written confirmation or amendment to this Confirmation documenting any confirmed Fixed Energy Price, any additional credit terms and any other applicable modifications to this Confirmation.  If such Fixed Energy Price is not confirmed by both you and us, the EESI Energy Price will remain unchanged.

The Mid Form contracts will be needed and should read similarly. 


The answer to your question below is that the difference between the two is the ""basis"" and the energy component is a wash:
 
""IS THIS THE RIGHT DEFINITION OF SPOT ENERGY PRICE HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM THE INDEX PORTION OF THE EESI ENERGY PRICE; IS IT JUST THE BASIS AND THE ENERGY COMPONENT IS A WASH?""

""Spot Energy Price"" means the weighted average (weighted in accordance with the Account's hourly usage or the Utility rate class usage profile) of hourly Real Time Locational Marginal Price for the applicable Utility load zone as posted by the ISO plus all non-Utility charges arising from uplifts, installed capacity, ancillary services, losses, congestion and other ISO charges or administrative fees incurred in connection with delivery of energy to the Delivery Point. 

There is no need for Excess Usage Language in the contract, however, deficiency language will apply as follows:

There will be no additional charges for Excess or Deficiency Usage through July 31, 2003.

From August 1, 2003 through the end of the Transaction Term, there will be no additional charges for Excess Usage; however, for each kWh of Deficiency Usage at each Account for each month, you will pay us an amount equal to the 0.0[ ] per kWh multiplied by the Deficiency Usage.


Please contact me if you have further questions.

Why is this formulation of the EESI Energy Price  any different than saying ""plus the Fixed Basis"" and then defining the Fixed Basis as a $/kWh amount?  Isn't it exactly the same?  We've written it the way it was before so it is easy to plug in the fixed basis number.

Why have you changed the calculations of excess and deficiency usage charges during the index period?  Why have you used the reference to a Management Fee in the new language?  Why are there no charges for Excess Usage during the index period--are you really giving them the fised basis position for unlimited usage?

Subject:	NJ Index plus

Following today's discussions with the Transaction Accounting group to discuss fixed basis Mark to Market, Product Management has modified the definition of the EESI Energy Price.   

The conclusion of the discussion with Transaction Accounting was that the Index product does in fact create a commodity position that the commodity desk can ""choose"" to manage.  The ""revenue"" position that is created when the contract is signed with the customer will be settled based on the published PJM Zone LMP, nevertheless the commodity desk may choose to manage their ""cost"" otherwise.  The proposed fixed basis will be treated as ONE with the index in determining the EESI Energy Price.   This approach is very similar in nature to the definition of the ""Plus"" that is defined in the ENovative Lite Energy Service Agreement for Gas products.  

Therefore, the EESI Energy Price will now read:

""""EESI Energy Price"" means the sum of the weighted average (weighted in accordance with the Account's hourly usage or the Utility rate class usage profile) of hourly Real Time Locational Marginal Price for the applicable Utility load zone as posted by the ISO plus $0.0[    ] per kWh.""

Please see the attached transaction confirmation and comment on the new definition of the fixed basis.  All references to the fixed basis (""Management Fee"")  as a separate component of the EESI Energy Price should be removed from the contract language.  


 

Please provide your comments accordingly.

Thanks

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Elliot,

From the Enron perspective, what are some of hottest direct access markets
where companies might be able to find a savings by buying electricity right
now?

Thanks,

The Agreements between Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Green Power Partners I LLC, are for a term endinging December 31, 2002.  The Agreement between Fetzer Vineyards and Enron Energy Services, Inc. is for a term ending April 30, 2002.  The Agreement between Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia) and Enron Energy Services, Inc. is for a term ending December 31, 2002.

Additionally,  Enron Energy Services, Inc. has entered into various agreement(s) with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. to sell additional ""green tickets"" from the Greeen Power Partners I LLC facilities in California:

EESI sells to EPMI, 1MW ATC, through December 31, 2001 (EPMI sells to EEMC)
EPMI sells to EEMC, 1MW ATC, through June 30, 2003
EESI sells to EPMI, 21 MW's, Sundays Off Peak, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)
EESI sells to EPMI, 14 MW's, Sundays ATC, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)

I do not know for sure how whether or not EPMI still plans to deliver to EEMC and/or LADWP, however if they plan to continue these sales and depending on our decision relative to Fetzer Vineyards and/or Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia), we may want to keep the Green Power Partners I LLC Agreement alive.  I have discussed the EPMI deals with LADWP with Chris Foster, EPMI Portland Office and am currently awaiting an answer from Chris as to the current status with LADWP.

Let me know if you have any questions.

In this case there is a product element because at least the 2 retail contracts I named require us to serve green. If we assume them, we have to have green to serve.

I thought the call on whether a contract is rejected was an economic call and not a product call.  If this is not the case then could we be forced to swallow the other discount off tariff contracts we  intend to reject?

Further, we need to know what the revenue is against this purchase to make a call on the economics.  

Richard - Do you have the Patagonia Contract? And/or any of the other green power transactions that EES has entered into with customer's?

Sounds like the economic justification for rejection is clear.  However, we need to be sure that we are not going to keep any customers where we have a contractual requirement to serve green power (Fetzer; Patagonia).  If we are comfortable that we are not, I think we can reject.

take a look at this. Unless there is a customer or regulatory reason to keep this, PPA, it would seem to me that we would want to reject this contract.

Murry,

Our forward curves show SP-15 power at $26.57/MWh for the period 02/01/2002-12/31/2002 (note that this does not include the discount for unit-contingency that usually accompanies wind power).  Green tags trade in the market for about $1.50/MWh.  Under the ""Green Tickets Sales Agreement"" it appears that EES has agreed to pay $39/MWh minus the market price of power, which is approximately $12/MWh for Green Tickets using our forward curves.

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Attached you will find two agreements EES has with ENRON Wind. 

1- Green Ticket Purchase Sale Agreement (PPA)
2- Scheduling Coordinator Service Agreement

With EES & ENA bankruptcy and the fact that Enron Wind has not been paid for the generation back to the month of November through current, Enron Wind is attempting to move their needs to APX for SC Services.  I also think they were looking for someone else to purchase their energy.  

I put a temporary stop on their actions but we are going to need to review these contracts to determine if we want to continue operating under them.

Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.

Dear NYISO Market Participants:

On December 11 - 13, 2001 the NYISO will present NYMOC in the Lone Star
State. We've just posted the course on our web site at

http://www.nyiso.com/services/training/cinfo/index.html

This course is similar to NYMOCs run in the Albany NY area, except that it
does not include Billing and Accounting details. The program will address
the latest system updates, however, and rigorously covers all marketplace
topics.

The course will be conducted at the Hyatt Regency Houston, 1200 Louisiana
Street, Houston, Texas, from 8:30 am  Tuesday December 11 until 3:00 pm
Thursday December 13. If you're interested, we suggest you register early
as we expect a healthy turn-out. In order to get a realistic count, there
will be a $300 charge for no-shows, or for cancellations not made by 12:00
noon Monday, December 3.

Please call Customer Relations at (518) 356-6060, if you have any questions
regarding the course, or Debbie Doyle at (518) 356-6274 regarding
registrations.

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron. 
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me."" 
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started. 
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985. 
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 
You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.
""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.
""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""

"Re: NJ Index plus","Why is this formulation of the EESI Energy Price  any different than saying ""plus the Fixed Basis"" and then defining the Fixed Basis as a $/kWh amount?  Isn't it exactly the same?  We've written it the way it was before so it is easy to plug in the fixed basis number.

Why have you changed the calculations of excess and deficiency usage charges during the index period?  Why have you used the reference to a Management Fee in the new language?  Why are there no charges for Excess Usage during the index period--are you really giving them the fised basis position for unlimited usage?

Subject:	NJ Index plus

Following today's discussions with the Transaction Accounting group to discuss fixed basis Mark to Market, Product Management has modified the definition of the EESI Energy Price.   

The conclusion of the discussion with Transaction Accounting was that the Index product does in fact create a commodity position that the commodity desk can ""choose"" to manage.  The ""revenue"" position that is created when the contract is signed with the customer will be settled based on the published PJM Zone LMP, nevertheless the commodity desk may choose to manage their ""cost"" otherwise.  The proposed fixed basis will be treated as ONE with the index in determining the EESI Energy Price.   This approach is very similar in nature to the definition of the ""Plus"" that is defined in the ENovative Lite Energy Service Agreement for Gas products.  

Therefore, the EESI Energy Price will now read:

""""EESI Energy Price"" means the sum of the weighted average (weighted in accordance with the Account's hourly usage or the Utility rate class usage profile) of hourly Real Time Locational Marginal Price for the applicable Utility load zone as posted by the ISO plus $0.0[    ] per kWh.""

Please see the attached transaction confirmation and comment on the new definition of the fixed basis.  All references to the fixed basis (""Management Fee"")  as a separate component of the EESI Energy Price should be removed from the contract language.  


 

Please provide your comments accordingly.

Thanks

"Re: NJ Index plus","While it is highly desirable to standardize products across regions, it is not often possible to maintain the same value proposition in all regions.  For example, NJ does not have a post transition default service as is the case for Maryland.  New York may be able to offer ICAP and Ancillaries in the fixed basis.   At this point, it appears that New Jersey's fixed basis will only include deal costs (consumption, credit, billing, scheduling fees and incentive repayment).  Therefore, NJ fixed basis will differ from that of New York's. 

We should await the final outcome of the Mark to Market issue before settling on the language for the NJ fixed basis. 

On the subject of Excess Usage during the index period, any excess usage on the part of the customer will mean more revenue for EES in the form of fixed basis times actual usage.  We should not impose an upper limit on an index product where actual volumes are passed through to the customer.   I agree, however, that there should be deficiency language to protect the fixed basis that is marked. 

Thanks

Subject:	Re: NJ Index plus   

Please see attached.  I am offering up some expanded language around the index we use so that it is more clear.  If we settle on that language, the spot energy price may need to be modified accordingly.  I am trying to make this consistent with the NY offering, which is similar in terms of how the index based price will work and what the basis will include.  

I am not convinced that we can't express the basis as the ""Fixed Basis"" rather than a plug number in the EESI Energy Price definition, so I have left it the way it was.  I am also not convinced that we can do away with excess and deficiency usage calculations during the index period.

I have added in the option to fix language, but I am not sure it is necessary or desirable to have it.  It is really an optic (customers always have the right to request a restructured price) and I'm not sure there is any reason to offer it in our form unless origination has as strong market-based reason to do so.

"Maryland ""Index Plus"" Product","Here's an update to yesterday's meeting on this subject.

Product Development (Jim Wood, JD Burrows, JeVaughn Sterling, Gillian Johnson and myself) had a brief discussion with Jim Brown (Transaction Accounting) to review the applicability of MTM accounting for the Maryland index product.

With relatively minor contract changes (to ensure the product is an ""Index Plus"" structure) the conclusion of the discussion was that the product should qualify for MTM.  Market costs will not necessarily match revenues (for the reasons we discussed yesterday) which should make the product eligible for MTM.   The desk would have an index position.  The desk can then choose to manage the position or not.

Nina and I certainly want to make sure you agree with this reasoning.  Here's a 1st draft of a TC with marked revisions.  The ""Management Fee"" is eliminated and replaced with EESI Energy Index Price plus $__/kWh in this draft. 

Please let me know if you think this is still workable from your perspective.  A follow-up meeting will be scheduled if needed.

Thanks,
Bob

"Summary version","Upon becoming a NEPOOL member, EESI chose to satisfy the Financial Assurance Policy requirement by 
issuance of Performance Bond(s) via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, which issued a Performance Bond 
in the amount of $8,000,000. 

On or about October 12, 2001, EESI received a letter from ISO New England dated October 10, 2001, indicating 
that EESI's current Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase the amount to 
$11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  

In telephone conversations with ISO-NE, EESI was informed that in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default 
the matter needed to be resolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (October 19, 2001). 

By October 16, EESI had requested a bond increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, 
but encountered delays in working with the bond company.

EESI Credit Department personnel sent ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001, via FAX, a copy of the request 
to the bond company for revisions to the Performance Bond, and indicated EESI was working diligently to resolve 
the matter.

Following resolution of delays with the bond company, a bond increase was issued by the bond company on 
October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on October 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE 
on October 23, 2001.  

EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to resolve the Financial Assurance Default due 
to delays with the bond company as mentioned above. 

On October 19, 2001 another letter was sent to EESI by NEPOOL indicating that EESI had not maintained the 
required level of financial assurance for 10 days or more and that this information was being forwarded to the 
NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action.  

However, according to Protocol for the Initiation of Membership Termination Proceedings the issue should be 
resolved with the receipt on October 24, 2001 of the Performance Bond by ISO-NE.

"Summary version","Peggy, this is a summary version of the original information from Richard Ring. Richard's input about the below was that
it might not be suitable for direct distribution to customers but that it was acceptable for internal reference or talking points.
I don't think it can be condensed any more without losing important information.

SUMMARY

Upon becoming a NEPOOL member, EESI chose to satisfy the Financial Assurance Policy requirement by issuance of Performance 
Bond(s) via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, which issued a Performance Bond in the amount of $8,000,000. 

On or about October 12, 2001, EESI received a letter from ISO New England dated October 10, 2001, indicating that EESI's current 
Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase the amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  

In telephone conversations with ISO-NE, EESI was informed that in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be
 resolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (October 19, 2001). 

By October 16, EESI had requested a bond increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, but encountered delays in 
working with the bond company.

EESI Credit Department personnel sent ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001, via FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for
 revisions to the Performance Bond, and indicated EESI was working diligently to resolve the matter.

EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to delays with the bond company 
as mentioned above. 

On October 19, 2001 another letter was sent to EESI by NEPOOL indicating that because EESI had not maintained the required level of financial 
assurance for 10 days or more, and this had occurred in combination with two other technical defaults, that this information was being forwarded 
to the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action.  

Following resolution of delays with the bond company, a bond increase was issued by the bond company on October 23, 2001, executed 
by EESI on October 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE on October 23, 2001.  

However, according to Protocol for the Initiation of Membership Termination Proceedings the issue should be resolved with the receipt on

Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO has determined that implementation of Virtual Trading will be
delayed until Wednesday, November 7, 2001.  Issues associated with new
computer hardware have necessitated extending the testing period to ensure
that all systems are ready before starting the program.

Virtual Trading will be in place for the Wednesday, November 7 Day-Ahead
Market (DAM).  The new schedule will permit bids for virtual load and
virtual supply to be submitted for Wednesday's market after the DAM posts
on Monday, November 5, until 5:00 a.m. on Tuesday, November 6.

"NYISO - MIS Outage - October 31, 2001","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants

Note:  The following change was originally scheduled for October 17, 2001.

On October 31, 2001, the NYISO web servers will be upgraded.  This will
require both software and hardware changes.  While these changes will be
transparent to the users, these changes will require that the MIS system
be unavailable for approximately 60 minutes.  The outage will begin at
approximately 11:35 AM.  Market Participants planning on submitting
HAM transactions or modifying Day Ahead bids should act accordingly.

The NYISO will minimize the duration of the outage as much as possible
as we recognize the inconvenience caused by system outages.  Ultimately,
these changes will result in a more stable environment and provide enhanced
services that the current web servers are unable to perform.

If you have any questions, please call your Customer Relations
Representative or the Help Desk at (518) 356-6060.

Thank You

"FORWARD PRICE VIEWS FOR COMPETITIVE ENERGY MARKETS","
 Link to www.ze.com  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] [IMAGE]   Forward Price Views for Competitive Energy Markets  [IMAGE] 	
  [IMAGE]   Dear Jubran,   Recognizing the pronounced volatility and uncertainty  in the energy industry, ZE PowerGroup has developed processes and  tools to facilitate dynamic trading and risk management. One of  the foremost tools required for competitive operation is the availability  of representative forward natural gas and power views for the various  market hubs.   Given that generation resource development, price behavior and  industry responsiveness has been significantly outside of historic  norms established during the extended period of regulation, and  given recent world events have resulted in greater uncertainty in  the economy it is critical that an organization be able to probabilistically  predict future prices, with some degree of accuracy.  The market is always asking itself questions like:   Should I commit to a deal now or wait?  For how much and for how long should I commit? What is the impact of this transaction on my portfolio? How do market events impact near, mid and long term pricing? How long will the price remain at the current level?  A forward view is a prerequisite to manage and optimize on an energy  portfolio in competitive markets. ZE PowerGroup provides short,  mid and long-term Forward Price Views. The Forward Price Views are  developed using sophisticated, top-down market simulation models  that are readily customizable and adaptable in size and scope to  any region in North America. The Forward Price Models have been  designed using the key drivers and fundamental parameters of the  natural gas and electrical power industries in combination with  econometric techniques and expert judgment. The value of the model  is in its ability to extract and quantify the expert judgment.  The difference between the ZE PowerGroup Forward Price Model and  other models is that of a top-down market simulation versus bottom-up  generation modeling. The bottom-up generation model does not always  account for market behavior and assumes that generation is predominantly  economically. These modes make little or no allowance for market  power, inefficiencies, gaming or other operational or unique market  factors.  ZE PowerGroup developed their first price views in 1996. The Forward  Price Model has performed well as a guiding tool; the views created  from the models have consistently predicted the direction of price  movement in the markets. It was one of the few models that predicted  rapid and consistent price increases after deregulation when the  industry consensus was that prices would retreat. Clients who have  incorporated the price views into their strategic planning have  reaped significant benefits and mitigated price risks; fairing better  than their counterparts.  The Forward Price Model can be coupled with the Market Monitoring  subscription, which adds value through targeted intelligence required  to optimize positioning in uncertain and volatile markets.  ZE PowerGroup strives to provide timely and required intelligence  at reasonable cost.  For more information on ZE PowerGroup's Forward Price Views  or on subscribing to a monthly market monitoring service, please  visit our web page at www.ze.com ,  contact us by email at paul@ze.com   or by phone at 604-244-1469.

	2)  Enron Wind's deliveries of energy to EES (resold to Lost Arrow)
	3)  Enron Wind's deliveries of energy to LADWP
	4)  Number of Green Tickets issued (monthly, historical)
	5)  Repair and/or maintenance schedule, whether planned or not
	6)  Fees/charges to EES from APX for administration of Green Tickets purchased

Right now it looks like EES is $11/MWh out-of-the-money on this deal.  That is, the forward curve for power from Feb '02 - Dec '02 is approximately $26.50/MWh (flat), Green Tickets trade for about $1.50/MWh, and EES's contract price is $39/MWh minus market energy price (~$12.50/MWh).

I think that the following, which Murray has begun, is what we need to do:

- Perry and/or Richter need to provide a valuation of the PPA
- based on that we can determine whether or not we want to accept it or reject it, that being said, we could also ask Wind Corp to provide us with a price for buying out of the deal so that they are free to sell to someone else and then of course, they can put their claim in as an unsecured creditor for the amounts due to them.


Thoughts ?

Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default
By Kristen McNamara

10/26/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) retail sales unit defaulted on its
credit requirement in New England's wholesale power market this month, but the
event was neither unique nor newsworthy, the energy company and the
organization that developed the market's rules said Friday.

  The operator of the region's wholesale power market informed Enron Energy
Services last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a
greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was
at risk for expulsion from New England's market.
  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that
triggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the
past, the market's rulemaker said.

  ""I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
participants"" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, ""and it's never
been in the news,"" said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New
England Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region's
electricity market. ""My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
proportion.""

  News of the Enron unit's default appeared in a trade publication and a major
metropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron's dealings with partnerships headed
by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company's
stock and bond prices.

  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its
bonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem
within a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said.

  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region's power
market, to notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the
wrong person, delaying the company's response, Mahoney said.

  ""Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit,"" Mahoney said.

  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England
spokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its
default.

  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on
occasion, Foley and Doot said.

  ""I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a
participant to find itself out of compliance,"" Doot said. ""Those things have
in fact happened from time to time.""

"Orders issued today in NYISO and ISO-NE proceedings","Today FERC issued the following draft orders:

NYISO TEP and Bid Cap (ER01-3001):  Commission granted NYISO's request to extend the currently effective $1000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO adminstered markets, and to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities, until the Northeastern RTO is operational.  The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.  

NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.  The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.  Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.

NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.  (ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.  The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.  Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made ""but for"" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.  

ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.

Calpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.

"NYISO - Delay of Virtual Trading","
market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO has determined that implementation of Virtual Trading will be
delayed until Wednesday, November 7, 2001.  Issues associated with new
computer hardware have necessitated extending the testing period to ensure
that all systems are ready before starting the program.

Virtual Trading will be in place for the Wednesday, November 7 Day-Ahead
Market (DAM).  The new schedule will permit bids for virtual load and
virtual supply to be submitted for Wednesday's market after the DAM posts
on Monday, November 5, until 5:00 a.m. on Tuesday, November 6.

"info/catch up/ RPS predictions","All - 
 

GSA issued an RFP for one of their Houston facilities.....might be a good opportunity for us.  Check it out <http://www.eps.gov/spg/GSA/PBS/PNE/GS-00P-02-BSD-0001/listing.html> 
 Chart depicting probability for RPS in states that EES is considering delivering physical power  (attachment below) 
 I finally had a chance to look over the fundamentals map.  Great way to organize the information.  I have a few questions/observations that I've listed below.   Many of the below comments might be premature as I don't know what stage you are in as far as filling in the information.  I also don't know if I have the most current link.  I used the following link <http://wnapdx-01a390/Renewables/DeregulationMap.htm>

 
1.  California:  Legislation - Is it accurate to say the legislation is ""pending"".  I thought it was highly unlikely that CA will go into another special session this year.  I believe the legislation will have to be reintroduced next session.  As far as risks/opportunities - Elliot could probably recap all of the wholesale opportunities associated with aggregating green for munis.
 
RPS
2. Nevada:  I'm assuming this just hasn't been updated yet?
 
3.  Arizona:  You might want to note that the renewable requirement is placed on utilities only until 2004.  Competitive supplier's obligation begins in '04.
 
4. New Mexico: Same as NV.
 
5. MN:  Make clear this requirement is on utilities.  I believe there is also a green pricing program requirement.  
 
6.  IA:  I believe this requirement is obsolete.  You might want to verify.  
 
7.  IL: Not sure this information is relevant as it is not an RPS, and doesn't apply to EES. 
 
8. CT:  The RPS applies to all competitive entities.
 
9.  MA:  Just passed final draft RPS.  While the definition you have is correct for renewables in MA, the eligibility is limited for compliance with the RPS to new renewables, coming on line after 12/31/97.  The definition is: Solar PV or Solar Thermal Electric; Wind; Ocean thermal, wave or tidal; fuel cells utilizing an eligible renewable fuel; Landfill gas; Low-emission advanced biomass power using the following fuels: agriculture and food waste, energy crops, biodiesel, organic refuse-derived fuel that is collected and managed separately from MSW, landfill or digester methane case.  The RPS applies to all competitive suppliers.
 
10.  Texas:  For some reason, TX is left off of the map as having an RPS.
 
11.  I thought you guys were concentrating on competitive states, so I was surprised to see IA, MN and HI on the list.  If you list these states, you'll need to go into a lot more detail as there are currently 220 utility green programs.  WI is probably the leading state for utilities with a mandate.  For the sake of simplicity, I'd limit it to competitive states.
 
 
Incentive funds:  I saw that your map included a space for incentives for renewables.   Below are the competitive states (albeit CA is no longer competitive) with renewable energy funds.  I don't know if you want to include all of this information.
1.  States with renewable incentives: CA, CT, IL, MA, MT, NM, NJ, NY PA, RI, 
 
 
Last:  I know you probably used the wording from Gov't affairs for the status of dereg.  You might want to update the information is the state is already open.  For example, IL says the state started restructuring in '99 and will continue to phase in customers until Dec 2000.  I believe that was written prior to Dec 2000.   You could just say that it is open.

 Hope this is helpful.  Jenny and Jesse, I know you've guys have put a lot of work into the fundies and it will pay off!

Subject:	Re: NJ Index plus   

While it is highly desirable to standardize products across regions, it is not often possible to maintain the same value proposition in all regions.  For example, NJ does not have a post transition default service as is the case for Maryland.  New York may be able to offer ICAP and Ancillaries in the fixed basis.   At this point, it appears that New Jersey's fixed basis will only include deal costs (consumption, credit, billing, scheduling fees and incentive repayment).  Therefore, NJ fixed basis will differ from that of New York's. 

We should await the final outcome of the Mark to Market issue before settling on the language for the NJ fixed basis. 

On the subject of Excess Usage during the index period, any excess usage on the part of the customer will mean more revenue for EES in the form of fixed basis times actual usage.  We should not impose an upper limit on an index product where actual volumes are passed through to the customer.   I agree, however, that there should be deficiency language to protect the fixed basis that is marked. 

Thanks

Subject:	Re: NJ Index plus   

Please see attached.  I am offering up some expanded language around the index we use so that it is more clear.  If we settle on that language, the spot energy price may need to be modified accordingly.  I am trying to make this consistent with the NY offering, which is similar in terms of how the index based price will work and what the basis will include.  

I am not convinced that we can't express the basis as the ""Fixed Basis"" rather than a plug number in the EESI Energy Price definition, so I have left it the way it was.  I am also not convinced that we can do away with excess and deficiency usage calculations during the index period.

I have added in the option to fix language, but I am not sure it is necessary or desirable to have it.  It is really an optic (customers always have the right to request a restructured price) and I'm not sure there is any reason to offer it in our form unless origination has as strong market-based reason to do so.

Stacey,
 

Elliot and I would like to discuss a few issues with you regarding the MS RPS Comments.  What time do you think that you will have to discuss?
 
 
<http://www.energy.ca.gov/renewables/documents/index.html#greenpower>
 
 
 
F-1:  Need to require that all current renewable facilities, including all current existing boimass facilities are certified prior to the start date RPS  - i put that in the comments, however MA might have a really hard time certifying any renewable facilities outside of MA that don't submit an application. 
 
F-5:  Not sure that I understand the issue surrounding compliance on a product level - let's discuss  -
Product v. Company.  If it's a straight company requirement, you could theoretically roll all of your RPS requirements into one product and sell for premium.  Further, not all MA customers would show that they are getting renewables. 
 
F-7:  While we are very pleased with the Division's inclusion of banking, we do not understand the need to restrict the limit on how much Supplier's are allowed to bank as the shelf life for Renewable Energy Credits is already limited to the two compliance periods immediately following.  We would also ask that you not limit the ability for Suppliers to transfer banked Renewable Energy Credits during the allowed compliance periods.  We feel that the Division should encourage as much liquidity as possible in the Renewable Energy Credit market.  We understand the Division's concern regarding transferable banking and potential problems with market power, however, we feel that the GIS Administrator is charged with closely monitoring potential market power situations.  We would prefer that the Renewable Energy Credit market be allowed to operate as indicated above from the beginning and if it is determined that market power issues exist then appropriate changes to the market can and should be implemented.  We feel that markets operate best with few restrictions.   Okay.  Good.  I'll substitute. 
 
F-9: Section 4. Not sure I understand the difference between the percentage of sales versus the actual MWh's - let's discuss
 
F-9: Section 5. Not sure that this language makes sense - let's discuss

Rogers,

Enron Energy Services, Inc. (""EESI"") submitted application to become a NEPOOL member, to be effective January 1, 2000.  EESI was approved by the NEPOOL Participants Membership Subcommittee at its January 24, 2000 meeting.  One requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Policy for NEPOOL Members.  EESI, Enron Energy Marketing Corp, and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the Financial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bond(s), rather than corporate guaranty, due to Enron's disagreement with the Form of Corporate Guaranty required by NEPOOL.

EESI, via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, issued a Performance Bond in the amount of $8,000,000 in June 2000; the Performance Bond was reissued in June 2001 in the amount of $8,000,000.  EESI received a letter from ISO New England dated October 10, 2001, addressed to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements) and received by Becky probably October 12, 2001, indicating that EESI's current Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase the amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  Becky delivered the October 10th letter  to my attention whereby I took the letter to EESI Legal Department (Karen Cordova) and informed Karen that EESI needed to increase the Performance Bond to $20,000,000.  Karen requested Credit Department (Nichole Gunter) initiate an increase in the Performance Bond to the $20,000,000 level; to the best of my knowledge the initial conversation with Credit Department was October 12, 2001.  In telephone conversations with ISO-NE, Enron's Credit Department personnel were informed by ISO-NE that in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be resolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (October 19, 2001), however the letter did not indicate such. 

I was notified by Credit Department on October 16, 2001 that the bond company Enron utilizes for performance bond(s) would not process our Performance Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstanding invoices for ""other"" performance bonds (bond  renewals), approximately $150,000.  The ""other"" performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI, since June 2001, to various individuals (i.e. Greg Sharp, Mark Mueller, Jeff Golden, Scott Mills) and had still remained unpaid.  Payments for the ""other"" performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our request for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, which was issued by the bond company on October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on October 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE on October 23, 2001.  EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond company as mentioned above.  Credit Department personnel informed ISO-NE personnel that EESI would not meet the October 19, 2001 deadline, but was working diligently to resolve the matter; Credit Department personnel sent via FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Performance Bond to ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001.  

I notified Dan Allegretti, (Enron Government Affairs & Chariman, NEPOOL Participants Committee) of the entire situation prior to October 19, 2001.  Dan indicated that he did not think there would be any problems, but to get the matter resolved as quickly as possible. Dan advised me that the implications of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to the Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published, the following month, EESI would no longer be listed as being in default.  On October 19, 2001 another letter was sent to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements) from Edward McKenna, Vice President & Chief Financial Officer informing EESI that ""Enron Energy Services, Inc. has not maintained the required level of financial assurance for 10 days or more, and has had a total combination of 3 financial assurance and/or payment defaults in the last 12 months, which qualifies them as having 2 (two) Level 1 defaults.  The ISO has been in contact with Enron Energy Services, Inc. through multiple telephone communications, and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured.  Therefore, per the established procedure, we are forwarding this information to the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action by them.""  According to Dan Allegretti the Memberhsip Subcommittee reports to him, as Chariman of the Members Subcommittee, and he would discuss the issue with them.  The previous two Financial Assurance Defaults mentioned the October 19, 2001 letter occurred (i) December 2000, when payment was received 1-2 days late and was automatically resolved when payment was received and (ii) September 2001, when Financial Assurance Default occurred and was resolved through market activity.  To the best of my knowledge, EESI was unaware of either the December 2000 Payment Default or the September 2001 Financial Assurance Default, and no information was received by EESI from ISO-NE relative to either incidence.

According to (i) Protocal for the Initation of Membership Termination Proceedings and (ii) conversations with Dan Allegretti, the issue should be resolved with the receipt on October 24, 2001 of the Performance Bond by ISO-NE.  I have also advised the ISO-NE, in the future, to send communications to EESI's Credit Department and not EESI's Settlements.  Also, Dan Allegretti is investigating the facts leading the the October 19, 2001 letter with representatives from ISO-NE.

I left message for Molly Harris as you requested. I was able to speak to Denise Furey and Nichole Gunter, who both indicated that they would speak with Molly as they all work together.  

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Richard

"Boston Globe Article","Peggy Mahoney asked me to forward this to you.

FYI - Here is a link to the Boston Globe article I have discussed with most of you. After numerous conversations and plenty of information proving otherwise, the reporter unfortunately decided to do this article based upon recent happenings. It is clearly a cheap shot.

 

On a happier note, here is a good article about our relationship with Quaker Oats in the Chicago Sun-Times.
