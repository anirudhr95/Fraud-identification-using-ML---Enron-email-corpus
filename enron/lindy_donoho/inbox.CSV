"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

"ELM Finance Course Offerings","
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

   Steve -

   I worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my
   time, $175/hour (normal rate is $350).  I would like to send you an
   engagement letter this week for up to 3 weeks or 120 hours ($21k).  I
   think
   we can get it done in less time but the 120 hours provides some
   flexibility
   if we decide to go deeper on something -- we would only charge you for
   the
   hours we use.

   I am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring
   options as well as the NPV, Income, and operational effect for each.  To
   the extent time allows, I will be able to help negotiate and close
   whatever
   option you choose.

   In order for me to offer our preferred rate, it is important to note
   that I
   would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis
   (e.g. Friday meetings, emails, and phone vs. being on-site 3 weeks
   full-time).  Even with this flexible structure, I feel confident that we
   can have the deliverable complete by mid December.

   Please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with
   these
   terms.


   ========================

   As for the new idea ----

   I have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power
   generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset
   position/market intelligence.  It occurred to me that there is an
   analogy
   here that relates to pipelines.

   Pipelines have operational ""events"" that may have  market effects:
       Unplanned outage  (major/minor/duration/notice)
      Planned outages over a certain volume
      Operation flow order/ SOLs
      Key Plants backed in
      Takes over schedule volumes key points
      Linepack levels
      Pressure drops at key points

   Since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through  gas needed for
   operational purchases - it is rationale that these phenomena would  be
   studied and acted (read traded) upon in order to minimize TW's market
   risk
   (read generate income).  TW can setup a risk management group to execute
   this idea. It is not unusual for a pipeline to  have a risk management
   function -  Duke Pipeline for example has a VP of  Risk Management for
   Pipelines.

   These ""events"" would be studied in the follow way -

   1. Determine whether there is a correlation between  an  ""event"" and gas
   prices/basis differentials. - based on historical  data.
   2.  For those events that have a strong  correlations, develop a trading
   strategy around the relationship.
   3.  Back-test the trading strategy against  historical data - determine
   profitability.
   4.  For operational ""events"" that are  applicable, setup a system to
   execute program trading that is directly linked to  SCADA.


   Secondary benefits of this risk management (trading) strategy, would be
   developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of
   selling
   the capacity physical vs. through basis derivatives. (or some
   combination
   of both)

   Steve, if you are interested in this idea I can  start drawing up a
   workplan for this study.

   Steve -

    I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options.  If
   your
   team is available I could come by next Friday mid-morning or later  to
   start discussing  with them.

   On the administrative side, I am working to nail down the lowest hourly
   rate I can get for you.  I would probably propose something like 80
   hours *
   rate, in the engagement letter.  This amount of time should be adequate
   to
   put together a short study on your different options.  I will send you a
   engagement letter this week.  I would just need to get that signed by
   you
   before Friday.

   Also, please let me know if you need any other information on the
   Reliability Centered Maintenance idea, as you prepare to talk to the
   other
   officers.

      Subject:  TW Earnings Idea - Twist on ECS Deals

      Hello Steve -

      Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick update -
   I
      moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months ago
   and
      have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management & Pipeline
      Optimization
      projects.

      I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.  Accenture
   has
      a
      strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability
   Centered
      Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology & technology
   for
      making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric T&D
      companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment.
      This
      is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:


      1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM
      2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)
      3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits from
      RCM
      (say $20MM) as part of our ""guarantee""
      4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over
      the
      next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.

      I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am
   around
      the
      Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to
      discuss
      further.

      Hope all is well.

"FW: Low Load GRI changes for 2002","

 -----Original Message-----

Subject:	Low Load GRI changes for 2002

Rosemary - Please forward to everyone in Marketing'
Raetta - Please forward to everyone in Gas Logistics.

The GRI rates will change, effective January 1,2002
Commodity changes from .0070 to .0055
High Load Reservation GRI (default) changes from .090 to .066
Low Load Reservation GRI changes from .0550 to .0407
Small Customer GRI (GS-T contracts) changes from .0110 to .0088

Marketers:
As the attached letter explains, I have redetermined which shippers are considered ""Low Load"" for the coming year.
The changes from Low to High or High to Low are listed in the letter.  A few customers flip-flop from year to year.  If any of your customers are affected, please advise them before January Reservation invoices go out (February 1, 2002).  NNG files a tariff change for the new rates, but does not file or mail out any notices about changes in a shipper's high/low load status.
 

John Williams/Gas Logistics - FYI.  The spreadsheet lists legal entities that are in the High Load or Low Load categories for 2002.
If a shipper is not listed, then it will default to the High Load GRI rate.

 
Call if you have questions.

Ramona,

Please take this and run with it and find out what the best solution is.  We need information on what the different options are and what the best solution is for January implementation of the change.  Let me know what help you might need.  The major impact seems to be to TMS and Accounting, with minor affects to CRS and CMS (determining credit and gaining the correct max rate).  We really need to have the solution defined by the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, or earlier if possible.

Thanks a bunch and let me know.

Andy,
I wanted to clarify on the item related to the West of Thoreau area.
To me, I think that we could create a new Basin in PLE and call it East of California. The area is still W. of Thoreau with two basins in that area. Maybe  check with Elizabeth to make sure she agrees. I have attached the POI view of one of the points that should be changed to the East of California basin. Let me know what you think.

Thanks Ramona

***PLAYBOY SEEKING ""WOMEN OF ENRON"" FOR PICTORIAL LAYOUT
   Saying its goal is to give Enron's female employees an opportunity that
could ""lead them down a new career path,"" Playboy magazine has launched a
national campaign seeking women willing to shed their clothing for an upcoming
pictorial layout entitled ""Women of Enron.""
   ""When one door closes, another one opens,"" said Playboy's photo director
Gary Cole, referring to the collapse of Enron and along with it, most of its
employee's savings.
   And so far the response has been phenomenal according to the Playboy
spokesperson.
   ""We've put the press release out five hours ago and the amount of
interested women is substantial,"" Playboy spokeswoman Elizabeh Norris told
OPIS. ""We have no limit on how many Enron women we'll use in the layout.""
   Norris added that Playboy hopes to have issue out as soon as possible and
is pushing for a summer release.
   To be eligible candidates must be at least 18 years of age and be able to
document their employment at Enron, along with a valid birth certificate and
photo ID. A recent photo in a two-piece swimsuit and a head-and-shoulders
portrait is also required.
   For additional information, call 312-373-2758.

Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Subject:	Bilas , Proposed Decision SoCal GIR

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :


1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to ""implement"" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.


On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with ""SoCal backbone
facilities"". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.


Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work ""relatively well"" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)


I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Mark, IGS.

We called every nite and i could tell they were sad. It was just too long away from the kids. I think 3 days away is the best. Anyway, we didn't win BIG but what a town. So much to see. I had a swedish massage on my birthday at the hotel. We stayed at the Monte Carlo which was fun-it has 6 swimming pools, a lazy river, a wave pool and 4 others. I loved the live music at all the different lounges. Marty wanted to take me to shows 2-3 nites while we were there but I'm glad we didn't preorder tickets. There was just too much to see besides the shows. We ate great. Wonderful restaurants. Anyway it was fun. Claire had her adnoids and tonsils taken out the day after !
we got home. Boy is that humbling seeing your child being taken to surgery and being put under anesthesia. Marty and I just bawled until we got back from surgery. She's recupering fine. It has been hard to keep her physically down the last 1 1/2 weeks. How is your gang? Did Sam get new workers at the day care now that he is older? How is it going there? Are Missy, Andrew and Anthony in school yet? How is Tony. Is the downturn in the economy affecting his business? Thanks so much for the sweet message. YOU are a BLESSING to me. You are always in my heart and thoughts. I just want your kids to know there is an ""aunt"" Holly in Omaha that loves them too--in addition to their Aunt Lisa and Aunt Amy! Take care. L.Y.L.A.S.

FYI.    This is my story for now, but I think it explains the volumes and the rates as well as the revenue projections.   Please note we have found a bust in 2002 revenue.   This yields a higher answer without any additional volumes being used.

"Enron Kids Adopt A Child Program","


 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to ""sponsor"" every child in that school.  What we mean by ""sponsor"" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to ""sponsor"" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!
Kevin Hyatt x35559 & The Enron Kids Committee

"NGI's Article on the Merger","NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : November 13, 2001
Watson: Enron Upside 'Clearly Worth Doing the Deal' 
Dynegy CEO Chuck Watson told the investment community Monday that he was ""90% sure"" that the risk/reward ratio in the planned merger with Enron Corp. made it ""clearly worth doing the deal,"" because the issues that decimated the former market leader were with its non-core businesses. Explaining that his team had ""adequately bracketed the downside,"" as the deal fell together over the past few weeks, Watson said he could not be ""99% positive,"" but noted that the upside was ""substantial,"" and said he had a ""good deal of confidence...that we'll be absolutely fine here."" 
Dynegy, which announced a $22 billion cash, stock and debt deal with its downtown Houston rival on Friday night, joined with Enron executives including Chairman Kenneth Lay on Monday to answer as many questions as they could in about 90 minutes. If all goes to plan, the two companies would become Dynegy Inc. by the third quarter of 2002, the clear leader in natural gas and power marketing. 
In the second quarter 2001, Enron and Dynegy combined sold a total of 36.2 Bcf/d of gas, which represented 21% of the volumes sold by the top 20 gas marketers in North America (168.9 Bcf/d), according to a ranking by NGI. Enron was the top gas marketer with 25.3 Bcf/d and Dynegy was No. 6 with 10.9 Bcf/d. Statistics provided by Maryland-based Energy Performance Review (EPR) show that Enron and Dynegy combined sold 143,824 million kWh of power in the second quarter. That total represented 14% of the power sold by the top 20 largest power marketers (1,000,961 million kWh), according to EPR. Enron was in fifth place among power marketers with 73,724 million kWh sold, while Dynegy was in sixth place with 70,100 million kWh. 
The blending of the two will not come without challenges, but Watson stressed he expects to see more opportunities than problems. The opportunity appears to have come none too soon for Enron. Greg Whalley, Enron's president and a future member of Dynegy's executive team, confirmed that without some kind of equity investment in the company, the once market leader probably could not have sustained its liquidity through the rest of this year. 
""We definitely needed to raise some type of equity capital,"" said Whalley. ""Under normal market conditions, we would have had adequate liquidity. This was not normal for Enron. We would not have had liquidity to the end of the year."" 
Asked about asset sales in anticipation of meeting federal requirements to merge, executives acknowledged there would be some, but did not elaborate. Whalley said that from an ""Enron perspective, we have not spent a lot of time with Dynegy people to agree on a plan. Chuck (Watson) has to clear what is core to Dynegy. There are several (assets for consideration to sell) on the list."" 
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who will not be part of the management team, but may hold a place on the Dynegy board of directors, added that Enron already has $4 billion in sales under contract, all expected to close by the end of 2002. ""We also have three other significant international assets under contract,"" said Lay, referring to the among other things, the Dabhol power plant in India. 
Once the merger of Dynegy with Enron is successfully completed, the new Dynegy will become the ""primary market player in all markets,"" but there will be a significant difference in how the company moves forward, noted Dynegy CFO Rob Doty. Enron's financial-backed trading strategy will merge with the ""strong asset base"" of Dynegy's. 
Dynegy has protected itself on the downside, however. The deal includes an out for Dynegy if Enron's legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. 
Asked about the possibility that some of Enron's marketing and trading team may desert the company for another company, Watson, stressing that teamwork will be the guiding force going forward, said, ""if I were in this industry, this is the combination I'd work for. This is an exciting day here. It's been an exciting couple of weeks"" creating a ""platform for something really special in the future."" 
Enron's Whalley said that he believes the company will keep most of its team intact. ""They're accustomed to being part of a winning deal,"" he said, and ""going forward, they will be very pleased with the additional infusion of equity and the stability in the marketplace."" As of Monday morning, Whalley said that ""activity looks pretty good,"" and said there had been a positive reception to the merger. ""Right now, people are pleased with the introduction of new liquidity, and really want to go about establishing or re-establishing the energy franchise."" 
Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom agreed. ""Most traders want to be part of a winning team. This is a combination that will be a winning team. We have similar issues there as well. The 'A' players will stay around to be part of the winning team."" Bergstrom explained that when the merger is complete, the new Dynegy will become the ""primary player in all markets."" He said Dynegy has a ""more asset-backed strategy,"" adding that he has said before that ""you can only have one market maker and Enron clearly was it."" By combining the two companies, there will be a blend of Dynegy's asset strategy with Enron's ""financial skill set,"" giving the new entity ""more liquidity market-making than Dynegy itself has historically done."" 
Added Watson, ""both companies had a successful ratio and nothing is going to change there...I'm a strong believer in teams and the team concept. I don't want to see individuals do well if the company doesn't do well. It (will be) imbedded in the whole company."" 
Ben Schlesinger, whose company Schlesinger & Associates analyzes the energy industry, said Monday that the big problem in the merger is ""whether these two companies are able to pull together...to harness what's there."" He said the ""two parties are clearly leaders,"" but theoretically, they will have to streamline their operations. ""Both books are fairly strong,"" he said, and once their efficiencies are put together, the new company will offer ""stable returns."" In the ""very short term,"" however, Schlesinger said there will be moves to other traders. 
Other analysts also seemed to be throwing support behind the merger. UBS Warburg reiterated its ""strong buy"" rating on Dynegy, noting that ""if successfully executed, this transaction would yield the most widely recognized, respected and downright credible wholesale/retail energy merchant in the world."" However, UBS warned that Dynegy still faces a ""daunting"" task in merging the operations and employees. ""We are not naive in underestimating the enormous challenge at hand. In the near-term, Enron must remain highly liquid, investment grade and its employees must remain focused on keeping its core wholesale/retail franchises up and running."" 
Merrill Lynch's Donato Eassey reiterated the ""buy"" on Dynegy and ""moving to no opinion"" on Enron. He said, ""Dynegy has all the necessary skill sets and as importantly, the financial stability, resources and investor confidence and experience to get the job done...Enron's unparalleled online trading business should translate to significant prospects for the new Dynegy."" 
Curt Launer, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, added that despite the size of the new company, ""we do not expect major divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business."" He noted too that with the combination, ""we have modeled a merchant unit that does 25% less business,"" because of ""cross trading between them and some expectation of a loss of market share."" Still, Launer said Dynegy would become a ""formidable competitor"" benefiting from a market share in excess of 20% of U.S. natural gas and power trading markets."" 
As expected with most major merger announcements, Moody's Investors Service placed the ratings of Dynegy and its subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade, noting that ""notwithstanding the franchise benefits of the proposed merger, the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegy's credit fundamentals."" The review affects about $4 billion of Dynegy securities, including its subsidiaries Illinova Corp. and Illinois Power Co. 
In its rating review, Moody's said it will ""assess Dynegy's plans to meet the liquidity needs of the combined entity and to deal with the uncertainty surrounding Enron's off-balance sheet transactions and contingent risks...and examine the ultimate structure of the transaction, and its impact on Dynegy's financial leverage and on management's targeted debt levels."" The ratings service also plans to ""consider the governance framework within which the combined trading activities will operate."" 
Ratings under review are: Dynegy's Prime-3 rating for commercial paper; Dynegy Holdings' Baa2 senior unsecured debt rating and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper; Illinova Corp.'s Baa3 senior unsecured debt rating; and Illinois Power Co.'s Baa1 senior secured and Baa2 senior unsecured debt ratings, and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper. 
Fitch revised its rating watch on Enron's outstanding securities to ""evolving"" from ""negative,"" where they were placed in late October. The rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised, lowered or maintained. Fitch also placed a rating watch negative on Dynegy and Dynegy Holding's long-term credit ratings, which also means they could be lowered or affirmed. The outstanding ""F2"" rated commercial paper programs for Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings were not affected.

"NGI Article on TW Ruling","NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : October 29, 2001
ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges 
A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009). 
ALJ Jacob Leventhal had only one fault to find, and that was with Transwestern's method of posting capacity. The judge said, and Transwestern agreed, to modify its tariff ""so that all posting, bidding and award procedures are set forth in a separate provision with an appropriate caption"" on its Internet bulletin board. Shippers had said that reviewing capacity on the Transwestern web site was ""a tortuous process."" 
Indicated Shippers claimed Transwestern's inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available. 
While ""both Indicated Shippers and (FERC) Staff find it curious that SET (Sempra Energy Trading) and Richardson (Products Co.) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them...curiosity does not translate into proof,"" the judge said. Witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting.  The judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with Transwestern's tariff. 
Similarly, Levanthal could find no evidence that Transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity. The capacity was available at recourse rates, and the shippers knew those rates were available. ""Staff's arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures, but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power."" 
The two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the ""index-to-index"" formula that produced the higher rates, rather than take the recourse rate ""to minimize any risk on transportation options."" The index-to-index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them. In this case the two points were the San Juan Basin and the SoCal Needles delivery point. 
The case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations.

"","Hello Lindy Lou,

It was such a wonderful surprize to get the nice Halloween card and the adorable picture of Sam. It made my day! Did Sam have fun trick or treating? What did Missy, Anthony and Andrew do for Halloween? How is their school year going? How is the BIG Tone?
Adam and Claire had fun-Adam was Harry Potter and Claire was a lion too!Things are really good for me. I cut my hours down to 32 hours a week and it has made all the difference in the world in terms of feeling like I can cope with this job. It has been taking a toll on me-lots of young patients our age dying and stuff. Anyway, things are Great! Marty man is doing good. I worked out with Jody Jurgens last week and it was her 1 year anniversary of being married. She's married to a very nice guy. My mom just got back from 18 days in Ireland-her 3rd time. She had a good time. Teresa and her clan were in Omaha for the game this saturday-what a blowout and Brian and his girlfriend (of 2 years) came over. We love her too. We told Brian if they break up were keeping her. Anyway I digress. I was just so touched to get that card from you and thought with all that is going on in the country right now, I've really reviewed in my life the things that really matter to me, what's really im!
portant. I just want you to know I think of you often. I have pictures of you and Tony (holdint the baby shoes) and now 2 pics of Sam up in the kitchen and living room. Even though you are not living here you and your family are loved and cared for and thought about by me often!I didn't mean to get mushy but was just thinking of you and wanted you to know. Write back and let me know the answers to my questions! PS-Amy had a baby?????That is great!L.Y.L.A.S.Holly

Subject:	RE: Transwestern Pipeline [TWP] (La Plata) Colorado Sales & Use Tax Audit - Summary and Status

I have left a message with Tracy Geaccone last month.  Penalty and Interest is not included for any amounts below.

The auditor is in the process of being promoted.  The auditor has issued tentative amounts and I had some challenges that we have been discussing.  The auditor will not issue a formal assessment until January, unless I push him for a number.  

The following are potential exposures and issues:

COMPRESSOR FUEL ($370,000 Penalty and Interest is not included)

It is too soon to know a specific tax assessment amount for this issue.  We will probably be assessed; but, I submitted a rough draft of my position challenging the entire assessment on compressor fuel.  He would not discuss an official position for this issue.  If compressor fuel is assessed,  I will be protesting the Price assigned to Compressor fuel (San Juan Hub - Spot Market) and the fact that local tax that was imposed.  It would be speculative to guess the probability of success in winning either of these challenges.


ASSETS (The revised jeopardy assessment was reduced from $600,00 to $292,000 Penalty and Interest is not included)

The primary assessment was imposed upon the September 1996 purchase of the La Plata facility.  After our tour, the auditor reduced the ""Revised Jeopardy"" assessment by 50%.  I submitted a rough draft position regarding items that remained.

Subject:	Transwestern Pipeline [TWP] (La Plata) Colorado Sales & Use Tax Audit - Summary and Status


We would like to meet with you to discuss the tentative results of Colorado Sales & Use Tax Audit.  After completing the fieldwork on May 23, the Colorado Auditor has decided to take a plant tour of the facility on July 20th.  

TENTATIVE MEETING DETAILS

	JULY 11TH
	1:00 PM
	Enron Building (Your offices)

AGENDA

We would like to discuss the following issues with you before the July 20th tour:

Assets

A $1,142,140 arbitrary assessment was issued 1/20/2000, including $608,167 tax + Penalty and Interest.  Colorado issued this assessment as a result of the PSA executed between TWP and Northwestern on September 1, 1996.  During the plant tour, the auditor will determine if the arbitrary assessment should be adjusted.  After this tour TWP will have an opportunity to challenge any amounts remaining.  We will discuss the protest issues and the costs associated with pursuing these issues.

Expenses/Compressor Fuel

The auditor has informed us that compressor fuel used by TWP is taxable.  We have confirmed that other taxpayers are also paying this tax.  At the conclusion of the audit, the auditor said that TWP may assign a reasonable value to the compressor fuel.  We will discuss the:

?	Values (Currently the San Juan Index)
?      Volumes
?      Period associated with the assessment
?      Tax rate

Allocable expenses

We will be available to discuss the O&M Agreements regarding:

?	The allocation of sales and use tax for Compressor Fuel for:
?	The audit Period
?      Prospective Periods
	?      TWP's obligation to notify Northwestern of extraordinary audit issues

"FW: TW Daily Balance Report"," The attached file has July 2001 and September 2001 analyzed.

I have compared the TW Balance Report to Actuals for July 2001 (see attached spreadsheet) and feel that the Fuel Retention numbers are good.  The Fuel Burned numbers are generally too low due to missing 3-days of actuals and some fuel meters are inputted only once a month and will be missing from the balance report.  However, when you use Ken's report just estimate the fuel numbers 25% higher and you will be OK.

The remaining volumes (Retention less Fuel less Sales) will equal imbalances and UAF.  Ken's report (area under construction) needs work to solve the imbalance question and we can discuss this next week.  He will be in Houston Monday and Tuesday.

Also, I want to make one thing clear.  Sales go to the bottom line, however if your selling imbalance gas received from a customer or line pack you will have an expense offset that also goes to the bottom line.   Conversely, if you are repaying (giving) gas to a customer you will have an expense credit that goes to the bottom line.  Over-retained gas (Retention less Fuel less UAF) is the only bottom line amount.  You can sell the gas outright or sell it to the customers imbalance or linepack.  If you sell it to linepack or volume valued imbalances, you will have taken on commodity risk.  We can discuss TW's risk profile next week.

Spoke with Richard Jordan at SWG this afternoon re: Phoenix ROW and El Paso F/R contracts.  

Richard said if the FERC staff recommendation for F/R is accepted, it will leave SWG in the position of needing a ""substantial"" amount of new transport capacity.

As for Phoenix ROW, they are looking at possibly taking the 8-inch line out of service and conveying it to us for Sun Devil in exchange for transport capacity on the project.  Their ROW varies in  type and width plus some is single use.  If they traded the line segment to us, we could use the existing ROW and just replace the line.

Anyway, I said we would stay in touch with them as things progressed with SD, hoping that things move a little faster now that FERC has given the market some direction.

I believe what Lisa (Sawyer?) was referring to is the termination of TW's shared cost surcharge effective October 31, 2001.  I don't think there would be any system changes required.  Typically, TW's rates are entered with a start and end date and (if this is correct) the surcharge should have an end date of 10/31/2001 and there wouldn't be anything else to do.  If it's not entered that way, an end date could be entered now (whether at the surcharge level or at the contract level - the surcharge applies to just 14 firm contracts) and that should take care of it.

Elizabeth,  Is this correct?  I know you're on a project, please let me know if you can check this or who can. 

Thank you!

Lisa brought up a TW change effective Nov 1.  It involves eliminating a turnback surcharge.  I have no other information, but you might check with the business folks for any system changes required.

In honor of Breast Cancer Month and those who have suffered you have been tagged by an Angel.


You have been tagged by the Friendship Angel (\o/) Which means you are a great friend! If this was sent to you it means you are a good friend! PLUS IF I HAD MY LIFE TO LIVE OVER I would have invited friends over to dinner even if the carpet was stained and the sofa faded. I would have eaten the popcorn in the ""GOOD"" living room and worried much less about the dirt when someone wanted to light a fire in the fireplace. I would have taken the time to listen to my grandfather ramble about his youth. I would never have insisted the car windows be rolled up on a summer day because my hair had just been teased and sprayed. I would have burned the pink candle sculpted like a rose before it melted in storage. I would have sat on the lawn with my children and not worried about grass stains. I would have cried and laughed less while watching television and more while watching life. I would have gone to bed when I was sick instead of pretending the earth would go into a holding pattern if I wasn't there for the day. I would never have bought anything just because it was practical, wouldn't show soil or was guaranteed to last a lifetime. Instead of wishing away nine months of pregnancy, I'd have cherished every moment realizing that the wonderment growing inside me was the only chance in life to assist God in a miracle. When my kids kissed me impetuously, I would never have said, ""Later. Now go get washed up for dinner."" There would have been more ""I love you's"" and more ""I'm sorry's"" but mostly, given another shot at life, I would seize every minute.....look at it and really see it ... live it ... and never give it back. In honor of Women's History Month and in memory of Erma Bombeck who lost her fight with cancer. Here is an angel sent to watch over you (\ /)


    Pass this on to five women that you want watched over. If you don't know five women to pass this on to, one will do just fine.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"New AZ Storage Facility Open Season","Copper Eagle Conducts Open Season for AZ Storage Facility 
Copper Eagle Gas Storage LLC., a joint event of El Paso Corp. and Pinnacle West Energy, currently is conducting a non-binding open season to assess market interest in a proposed high-deliverability natural gas storage facility to be located west of Phoenix, AZ, in Maricopa County. 
""We haven't decided whether to firmly go ahead with the project"" at this point, said Sheri Foote, a spokeswoman with Pinnacle West Energy, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. If Copper Eagle should receive the go-ahead, however, she noted it would be the first storage facility to be located in Arizona. She would not give a timetable as to when a final decision would be made. 
The storage facility would have a working gas storage capacity of 3.2 Bcf, with the capability of withdrawing the entire working gas volume in 10 days, and injecting the working gas volume in 20 days. The project, assuming it gets the green light, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2004. 
The non-binding open season, which began last Tuesday, will run until Oct. 24 at 5 p.m. CDT. For more information about the project and the terms of the open season, go to web site www.coppereagleGS.com <http://www.coppereagleGS.com> or telephone Russ Kovin at (832) 676-5659.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

The legal description for the proposed Southern Trails interconnect north of the Blanco Hub is Sec. 13, T29N, R11W, San Juan County, NM.  This is on the old NWPL receipt line coming off the 30"" Ignacio - Blanco line into the Blanco Hub upstream of the El Paso Blanco measurement.  Bottom line is it's the same place we talked about earlier this week.

THOU SHALT NOT SKIM FLAVOR FROM THE HOLIDAYS 

By Craig Wilson, USA TODAY 

I hate this time of year. Not for its crass commercialism and forced 
frivolity, but because it's the season when the food police come out 
with their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the 
holidays without gaining 10 pounds. You can't pick up a magazine 
without finding a list of holiday eating do's and don'ts. Eliminate 
second helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies made with butter, 
they say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say. Good grief. Is your 
favorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot stick? I didn't think 
so. Isn't mine, either. A carrot was something you left for Rudolph. 
I have my own list of tips for holiday eating. I assure you, if you 
follow them, you'll be fat and happy. So what if you don't make it to 
New Year's? Your pants won't fit anymore, anyway. 

1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on 
   a holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In 
   fact, if you see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where 
   they're serving rum balls. 

2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine 
   single-malt scotch, it's rare. In fact, it's even rarer than 
   single-malt scotch. You can't find it any other time of year but now. 
   So drink up! Who cares that it has 10,000 calories in every sip? It's 
   not as if you're going to turn into an egg- nogaholic or something. 
   It's a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for me. Have two. It's later than 
   you think. It's Christmas! 

3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole point of 
   gravy. Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill 
   it with gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat. 

4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made with skim milk 
   or whole milk. If it's skim, pass. Why bother? It's like buying a 
   sports car with an automatic transmission. 

5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control 
   your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat 
   other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college? 

6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New 
   Year's. You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do. 
   This is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the 
   buffet table while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of 
   eggnog. 

7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like 
   frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position 
   yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can before 
   becoming the center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair of 
   shoes. You can't leave them behind. You're not going to see them 
   again. 

8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each. 
   Or, if you don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. 
   Always have three. When else do you get to have more than one 
   dessert? Labor Day? 

9. Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded with the 
   mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean, 
   have some standards, mate. 

10. And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave the 
    party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying attention. 
    Reread tips. Start over. But hurry! Cookieless January is just 
    around the corner.

Hey Lindy -

I haven't seen or talked to you in a while.  It will be fun to
(potentially) work with you and Lorraine again -- I can at least treat you
guys to a couple of good lunches!

Next Friday will be fine for me.  I am out of town through Thursday, but
open all next Friday - so just let me know if something on the 9th would
work for ya'll -

I think there are five potential deal areas on the table:

1.  Restructure existing ECS deals (bisti, bloomfield, gallup-switch from
MTM to accrual, hubbard, WT1)
2.  Increase netback from Gallup demand management (up to $2MM/year);
possibly MTM the remaining balance?
3.  New ECS/EES deals
4.  RCM Project -- $20 MM to $100 MM guaranteed incremental cashflow and
earnings for GPG in 2002
5.  ETS Trading/Risk Management Project - use SCADA data for incremental
earnings creation through trading/risk management


See you then.


Dave

Dave,
     If possible, I would like for you to sit down with Lindy and a few
folks from our group who have been looking at this. I want to make sure
that it would be an efficient use of your time and that we would not be
duplicating anything. I will have Lindy contact you so we can set
something
up and then move forward as necessary. Thanks.

   Steve -

   I worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for
my
   time, $175/hour (normal rate is $350).  I would like to send you an
   engagement letter this week for up to 3 weeks or 120 hours ($21k).  I
   think
   we can get it done in less time but the 120 hours provides some
   flexibility
   if we decide to go deeper on something -- we would only charge you
for
   the
   hours we use.

   I am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring
   options as well as the NPV, Income, and operational effect for each.
To
   the extent time allows, I will be able to help negotiate and close
   whatever
   option you choose.

   In order for me to offer our preferred rate, it is important to note
   that I
   would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible
basis
   (e.g. Friday meetings, emails, and phone vs. being on-site 3 weeks
   full-time).  Even with this flexible structure, I feel confident that
we
   can have the deliverable complete by mid December.

   Please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with
   these
   terms.


   ========================

   As for the new idea ----

   I have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power
   generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset
   position/market intelligence.  It occurred to me that there is an
   analogy
   here that relates to pipelines.

   Pipelines have operational ""events"" that may have  market effects:
       Unplanned outage  (major/minor/duration/notice)
      Planned outages over a certain volume
      Operation flow order/ SOLs
      Key Plants backed in
      Takes over schedule volumes key points
      Linepack levels
      Pressure drops at key points

   Since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through  gas needed for
   operational purchases - it is rationale that these phenomena would
be
   studied and acted (read traded) upon in order to minimize TW's market
   risk
   (read generate income).  TW can setup a risk management group to
execute
   this idea. It is not unusual for a pipeline to  have a risk
management
   function -  Duke Pipeline for example has a VP of  Risk Management
for
   Pipelines.

   These ""events"" would be studied in the follow way -

   1. Determine whether there is a correlation between  an  ""event"" and
gas
   prices/basis differentials. - based on historical  data.
   2.  For those events that have a strong  correlations, develop a
trading
   strategy around the relationship.
   3.  Back-test the trading strategy against  historical data -
determine
   profitability.
   4.  For operational ""events"" that are  applicable, setup a system to
   execute program trading that is directly linked to  SCADA.


   Secondary benefits of this risk management (trading) strategy, would
be
   developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of
   selling
   the capacity physical vs. through basis derivatives. (or some
   combination
   of both)

   Steve, if you are interested in this idea I can  start drawing up a
   workplan for this study.

   Steve -

    I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options.  If
   your
   team is available I could come by next Friday mid-morning or later
to
   start discussing  with them.

   On the administrative side, I am working to nail down the lowest
hourly
   rate I can get for you.  I would probably propose something like 80
   hours *
   rate, in the engagement letter.  This amount of time should be
adequate
   to
   put together a short study on your different options.  I will send
you a
   engagement letter this week.  I would just need to get that signed by
   you
   before Friday.

   Also, please let me know if you need any other information on the
   Reliability Centered Maintenance idea, as you prepare to talk to the
   other
   officers.

      Subject:  TW Earnings Idea - Twist on ECS Deals

      Hello Steve -

      Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick
update -
   I
      moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months
ago
   and
      have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management & Pipeline
      Optimization
      projects.

      I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.
Accenture
   has
      a
      strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability
   Centered
      Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology &
technology
   for
      making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric
T&D
      companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline
segment.
      This
      is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:


      1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM
      2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)
      3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits
from
      RCM
      (say $20MM) as part of our ""guarantee""
      4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM
over
      the
      next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.

      I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am
   around
      the
      Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to
      discuss
      further.

      Hope all is well.

"Southern Trails Cancels Calif Part of Pipeline Conversion","State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails 
Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. 
It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
Whether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said.

TK could you update these prices for me for the Stan Presentation (one more time - it's due to Tracy on Thurs)?

I don't need the historical NYMEX again, unless Vernon has the NYMEX settle price for Jan - Sept '01 (Weren't the historical numbers from last week Inside FERC because we were having a system problem?)

I need them by tomorrow after lunch.  I'm in a meeting from 8:00 to 12:00 tomorrow.  If you have any questions, leave me a voicemail - I'll check it during break.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"New TW Contract System","Lindy,

Just wanted to let you know that we have started working on the TW contract and capacity release system.  I believe there will be a kick-off meeting sometime next week which you will be invited to attend.  We are due to implement on January 14th which gives us very little time to get everything we need to get accomplished so I will be calling and asking you alot of questions in the next month or two.  I'd like to try and get together with you soon on two items, inside/outside the path and flow direction.  I will be out on vacation next week.  If you have time on Friday that would be great, otherwise could we talk by phone next week?  Please let me know.  Thanks

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Ramona,

Please take this and run with it and find out what the best solution is.  We need information on what the different options are and what the best solution is for January implementation of the change.  Let me know what help you might need.  The major impact seems to be to TMS and Accounting, with minor affects to CRS and CMS (determining credit and gaining the correct max rate).  We really need to have the solution defined by the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, or earlier if possible.

Thanks a bunch and let me know.

I wanted to clarify on the item related to the West of Thoreau area.
To me, I think that we could create a new Basin in PLE and call it East of California. The area is still W. of Thoreau with two basins in that area. Maybe  check with Elizabeth to make sure she agrees. I have attached the POI view of one of the points that should be changed to the East of California basin. Let me know what you think.

Thanks Ramona

"ETS Year-end Performance Evaluation Process","
The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.  Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.  This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.

(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)

Feedback and Evaluation
Employees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.

?	PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7
?	Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14
?	Written evaluations due to HR			January 15

Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.

Compensation
Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.  Division Head approval is required.

As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.

Relative Talent Reviews
Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.  The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.  Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.  Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.  Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.  EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.  Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.

If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative.

Gary

"FW: Consultant's view on gas transmission into California","I received these comments this afternoon from JPMorgan.     I need to have some help putting together a story to counteract the basics of this story from CERA.

Subject: Consultant's view on gas transmission into California
Importance: High


Rod:

As we discussed here are the bulletts that summarize what we heard from our consultants.

Overall demand picture

Believe it will be 2006 before the California market will get back to 2000/2001 demand levels

          2002            demand down approximately 900 mmcf/d
          2003            demand will be flat
          2004            growth in demand will begin
          2005-2006   return to 2001 demand levels

Reasoning:
   2001 was a dry year - the lack of hydro generation created an additional 600 mmcf/d demand for gas in California
   Anticipated generation capacity overbuild in California - new more efficient power plants with better heat rates will displace older gas fired generation, reducing the amount of gas              required to generate a MW of electricity on the margin
   California electricity rate increases have curtailed demand for power and subsequently, gas

Gas transmission capacity into the state

Over the next two to three years there will be an additional 2.0 Bcf/d of transmission capacity into California
   800 mmcf/d in 2002
   900 mmcf/d in 2003 (Kern River expansion)
   300 mmcf/d               (El Paso conversion of All American oil line and power up)

San Juan basin gas

San Juan basin production is declining

   first half of 2001 vs. first half of 2000 production off by approximately 200 mmcf/d
   Rockies gas will not replace declining production in the San Juan San Juan gas will move closer to Permian pricing


The consultants believe that the combination of these factors will put decontracting pressure on existing transmission into the state of California, and especially the El Paso and Transwestern lines.

However, the ""wild card"" in their view is unforeseen California power demand growth.

As we discussed, JPMorgan would like to hear your views on the above issues.

Please give me a call when you have had sufficient time to digest and we can set up a conference call to make the most efficient use of your time.

Thanks Rod

Brent

Also, when you have had a chance to look at sales gas volume growth please
e-mail the volume numbers to me...thanks

Subject:	Capacity Posting Tariff Sheets

My other comments on the tariff sheets were as follows:

Section 35.2
	2nd paragraph, 3rd sentence.  Explanation of ""incremental revenue"".  When we talk about revenues which TW already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.  What if we're taking bids on future capacity and we're trying to get revenue that is incremental to reservations charges we're not necessarily being paid yet?  The language is so specific.  Can we change the language to refer to revenues incremental to what TW already has contractually committed?

	2nd paragraph, last sentence.  The phrase ""guaranteed throughput volume service applies only in the case of a negotiated rate"".  What does this mean?  TK & I were both a littles confused by this language.

	4th paragraph, 4th sentence.  The phrase ""the value of the index based rate bids will be calculated using the applicable published indices available on the bid deadline"".  TK, is the phrase ""published indices"" generic enough or should we use something broader that might encompass basis quotes?  I realize it will probably have to be something that is published.

Subject:	Ctrc 24690 Continental CMS

Perry had asked me whether this contract had ROFR or not because he thinks it should be terminated, but CAS is still reserving capacity for the contract because it has a ROFR flag on it in CBS.  I think that this contract does not have ROFR, but could you confirm this for me?  If my memory is correct, I thought that this agreement was always done just a month or two at a time and that at the end of each term it was negotiated with the price desk (& more recently TK) to roll for another month or so.  If I'm thinking of the right contract, that would mean that it did not have a ROFR (because it was not for a year or longer) and that it terminated 3/31/2001.

Could you check the contract file for me and look at the amendment history to confirm that the agreement did not have a year or longer term?  If not, then this agreement should not have the ROFR contract on it.

Let me know.  Thanks!

"RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding","I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about ""Shipper Imbalances"" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order (""OFO"") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

The decision does however make some modifications which may not be in our best interest i.e. the adoption of a price cap for secondary market transactions.  Due to the lapse in time on this proceeding, Com. Bilas has granted participants the right to file comments by Friday, October 19, 2001.  Please review and advise if you agree we should file comments (I also have a call into Mark Baldwin).  Note this is 140+ pages--you may wish to review the summary and pertinent sections.

The requested changes have been made to the ""TW Unsubscribed Capacity"". Please review the test site http://twdev.ets.enron.com/twdb/etfr_unsubcapasp.html and at your earliest convenience let me know if you are satisfied with the format changes.

"RE: GULF COAST 3rd QUARTERLY PRODUCTION REPORT","
RE: GULF COAST 3rd QUARTERLY PRODUCTION REPORT

Lippman Consulting, Inc. is pleased to announce that it has just completed 
the 3rd quarterly of 2001 production report for the Gulf Coast Region.  This 
report contains numerous charts and graphs as well as extensive text 
depicting the historical volumes produced from this region through the third 
quarter of 2001.  This report analyzes the production in various ways so that 
the reader can obtain a complete understanding of the supplies contained in 
this dynamic region. This is truly a bottoms up report.  Lippman Consulting 
is currently publishing twelve separate monthly reports covering each of the 
area's specific regions that make up the Gulf Coast.  Extensive detailed data 
is contained in each of those reports. This quarterly report, which compiles 
the data for each of those area reports, is intended to be a summary report 
for our clients that do not want that level of detail but want to be advised 
on the overall Gulf volumes. The Gulf Coast region contains almost 50% of the 
domestic production and therefore is very important to the overall national 
gas markets. 

The cost for this report is $300 on a quarterly subscription basis or the 
report can be purchased on a one-time basis for $450. If you would like 
additional information or to order this report, please feel free to contact 
me by e-mail at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.

"Information for our Meeting","
Lindy -

While it is fresh on my mind -- it would be great if you could capture the
following information before our meeting:


 - the amount of Unamoritized Accrued Earnings related to Gallup (remember
- Andersen wouldn't let us take it as MTM) [Centilli should have access to
this information]
- the amount of the rebates you have been receiving from ECS for Gallup
related to the demand charge miss [Centilli should have access to this
information]
- copies of all the ECS agreements (Bisti, Bloomfield, Gallup, WT1,
Hubbard)
- Hubbard run hours and payments ECS - last 3 years [you can ask John Sturn
for this]
- Projected amount of TW fuel over collection 2002
- A list of the other ETS electric compressors [John Sturn]
- Total non-compressor related electric charges ETS paid in 2000 and 2001 -
someone in Wasaff's group should have this / or someone in Omaha.


See you then.

Kim, I wasn't waiting on you.  You had provided me with a contact last year I just misplaced my note.  (Feel like we are running a race with the Devil lately and he is gaining ground.. Ha!    It's so busy....)

The Operating Agreements I know that are no longer on file include:  (This is really kind of embarassing as I know these Operating Agreements were on file when I was on the Bloomfield Team.  Someone must have discarded them...)  Anyhow,

Amaco LaPlata
Northwest Pipeline - La Plata
WFS - LaPlata
Red Cedar both La Plata and Ignacio
WFS LaMaquina
WFS Milagro - Blanco Hub
TransColorado - Blanco Hub
Burlington - Blanco Hub
NTUA - San Juan 
Citizens if there have been updates in the last five years. - Flagstaff and Kingman TBS's

I hope this is not to much trouble...   My priority for now lies with Amaco/La Plata... No hurry on any of the others..  Thank you so much

Thank you so much for the reminder, sometimes I think my brain has slipped away.  Do you need all of the San Juan and West of Thoreau contracts?  If you know you have some of them, which ones do you have, I'll send you the rest.

My apologies,

"Weekly Report of 3/15/02","California:

California Infrastructure.  FERC staff made a presentation at the March 13th meeting indicating that in-state capacity is insufficient to meet peak power demand.  Staff indicated that only two favorable factors beyond the state's control that have changed since the power blackouts of a year ago:  the economy and the weather.  With recession, energy demand is down and therefore prices are near a five-year low.  Heavy snowpack in the Pacific Northwest/California areas will provide sufficient hydropower for the upcoming summer peak periods.  Staff was critical of the lack of effort made to build additional power plants to accommodate California requirements.

RP00-336 El Paso Capacity.  FERC staff concluded that El Paso's firm service is no longer reliable due to the Full Requirement customers growth and impact on available receipt points/capacity.  Staff recommended that FR customers be converted to Contract Demand and that technical conference be scheduled.

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Subject:	FW: SCG Advice 2837-A

After discussing with Lynn and Glen, we think that we would like to file comments in this proceeding concerning an issue we have had since this has been implemented on Nov 1.  In instances where SoCal happens to call their OFO in the Intraday 2 cycle, it can cause Transwestern to have Shipper imbalances because we do not have an opportunity to pass-along these reductions to our upstream parties.  We think we would like to file a letter that may mention our general support of the ""direction"" of SoCal's changes, but that we do have an issue that has developed since actual implementation that we are currently working on with them.  Lynn & I worked on this rough general description we thought could be incorporated into a brief letter.
	
		""If SoCal calls an OFO in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCal.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is unable to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.""

Lynn thinks if we are unable to resolve this issue with SoCal, TW could have high Shipper imbalance exposure.

Glen and Steve:
 
The attached supplemental advice filing by SoCalGas replaces the  changes to Rule 30, Transportation of Customer-Owned Gas, proposed by AL2837.   The purpose of this filing is to  describe the new internal receipt point operating procedures that SoCalGas is  implementing, and to request Commission authorization to include the revised  operating procedures in Rule 30. SoCalGas says this step is being taken in  anticipation that it will be replaced with a system of firm tradable intrastate  transmission rights in Gas Industry Restructuring (GIR) proceeding, I.99-07-003.  
During  the GIR panel hearings, several parties requested that SoCalGas publish its  windowing criteria in tariffs to facilitate a better understanding of the method  used to allocate receipt point  capacity.  SoCalGas agreed to make  such a filing, and D.99-07-015 directed SoCalGas to file an advice letter adding  windowing information to its tariffs.  To comply with this directive, on August  6, 1999, SoCalGas filed AL2837, which has not been acted on by the Commission.  
Customer complaints about SoCalGas' windowing  procedures have convinced SoCalGas that it should replace its internal  windowing operating procedures with a system that is open to the maximum  operating capacity at each SoCalGas receipt point.  SoCalGas is making these internal  operating changes effective November 1, 2001.  SoCalGas held meetings with upstream  pipelines on October 17, and with interested customers and stakeholders on  October 18, regarding the upcoming changes.  They were invited to ask any questions in  the days leading up to the meetings. 
Comments and/or protests are due on November 21.  Have a good  weekend!

There are files that back up the revenue projections that Steve Kleb gave me hard copies of for 2001 and 2002.  Can I get electronic copies of these, they have volumes and margins and appear to back up the revenue projections.   

2002 File looks like s\marketing\twfinmkt_anly\Tw\twfin\2001\misc\[plan_forecast_design.xls]\summary.  

2001 file looks like s\marketing\twfinmkt_anly\tw\twfin\2001\forecast-CE\[ce 3-2001.xls]model _source_data.    

If the same exists for 2000 can we get it as well.  I would like as soon as possible and you can email to the cc addresses as well.

From 3:00 - 9:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  If you need access to 3AC anytime Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information.  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access. 3AC Telco and Voicemail services will be unavailable during the outage period.

"CALIFORNIA 2nd QUARTER PRODUCTION REPORT","Lippman Consulting, Inc. is pleased to announce that it has just completed 
the 2nd quarterly of 2001 gas production report for the state of California. 
This report contains text and graphs depicting various historical statistics. 
The total California production volumes are separated by associated and 
non-associated volumes. The report also separates production by state and 
federal areas as well as onshore and offshore volumes. For the onshore 
volumes, we detail the production down to the district level while for the 
offshore volumes, we detail those down to the field level. In addition to 
showing historical production volumes in various categories, the report also 
provides the reader with monthly net gas storage injection and withdrawal 
volumes along with the total gas volumes in storage for the state. Working 
gas as well as cushion gas levels are also reported.  California is a major 
consuming district and the level of production contained within the state has 
a direct bearing on the amount of gas imports that will be needed to satisfy 
demand.

The cost for this report is $300 on a quarterly subscription basis or the 
report can be purchased on a one time basis for $450.  If you would like 
additional information or to order the report, please feel free to contact me 
by e-mail at Lippmanc@AOL.com or phone at 915-581-1668.

"Infrastructure Announcements: Transco, Petal Gas Storage, ANR's Kenosha Exp, Gulf South's Gulf Pines, CIG's Western Frontier","Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB
Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
""The Commission's authorization is being granted based on our findings...that the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States, thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market,"" FERC said in its draft order. ""Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way, the project's environmental impact will be minimized. Finally Transco's existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate."" 
Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002.  The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing (25,000 Dth/d), PECO Energy Co. (30,000 Dth/d), Reliant Energy Services (25,000 Dth/d) and Williams Energy Marketing (50,000 Dth/d) are all customers. The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is $13.56/Dth/month. 
The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC (see related story) covers a new pipeline that would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. The project is designed to deliver 700,000 Dth/d of gas to Southern Company's gas-fired generation in the Southeast. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral extension will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co.'s proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The project includes 13 miles of 20-inch diameter looping along ANR's Racine Lateral and a 10-mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant. The project would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003. 
In the Kern River case, shippers had requested rehearing of FERC's order granting Kern authorization for its 124,500 Dth/d 2002 Expansion Project and an additional 10,500 Dth/d under its revised California Action project. Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights. Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes. 
However, the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights, ""given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California."" 
Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in $1 Billion Southeast Pipe 
Houston-based Gulf South Pipeline Co. LP, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, on Wednesday said the open season for the company's proposed $1 billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was ""extremely successful,"" adding that response to the 1 Bcf/d line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the company's expectations. The open season concluded on Sept. 19. 
The proposed 600-700 mile, 36-inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline, which was first announced in August, is expected to originate in Mobile, AL, and extend through the states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
""The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation, commercial, residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States,"" said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert. 
The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay, enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies, but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana, including Venice and the Henry Hub, according to Gulf South, a subsidiary of Entergy-Koch LP. The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple third-party storage facilities, such as Gulf South's facility in Bistineau, LA. 
""We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region,"" said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo. 
In addition to serving power generation, the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline, bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before. 
Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year. He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined. Gulf South said the anticipated in-service date is sometime in 2004. 
Gulf South currently owns and operates 8,800 miles of pipeline with 33 compressor stations and 120 major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area. 
Williams Files to Build 400-Mile Western Frontier Pipe 
Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new $365 million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma. The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of 400 miles of 30-inch diameter pipe and 30,000 horsepower of compression. It would transport up to 540,000 Dth/d of gas to markets in the Midcontinent. 
In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system, Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines, including ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, Northern Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America. Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system. The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov. 1, 2003. 
""Western Frontier Pipeline is a cost-effective, environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent,"" said Kim Cocklin, senior vice president and general manager of Williams' Central and Texas Gas systems. ""We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region, which was recently cited by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.'' 
Customers interested in Western Frontier should contact Donny King at (270) 688-6968, Mark Elliott at (270) 688-6637 or Dale Sanders at (270) 688-6944. More information on Western Frontier is also available on the Internet at <http://westernfrontier.williams.com> .

"RE: ECS Contract Review & New Idea","Dave,
	If possible, I would like for you to sit down with Lindy and a few folks from our group who have been looking at this. I want to make sure that it would be an efficient use of your time and that we would not be duplicating anything. I will have Lindy contact you so we can set something up and then move forward as necessary. Thanks.

Subject:	ECS Contract Review & New Idea

Steve -

I worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my
time, $175/hour (normal rate is $350).  I would like to send you an
engagement letter this week for up to 3 weeks or 120 hours ($21k).  I think
we can get it done in less time but the 120 hours provides some flexibility
if we decide to go deeper on something -- we would only charge you for the
hours we use.

I am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring
options as well as the NPV, Income, and operational effect for each.  To
the extent time allows, I will be able to help negotiate and close whatever
option you choose.

In order for me to offer our preferred rate, it is important to note that I
would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis
(e.g. Friday meetings, emails, and phone vs. being on-site 3 weeks
full-time).  Even with this flexible structure, I feel confident that we
can have the deliverable complete by mid December.

Please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with these
terms.


========================

As for the new idea ----

I have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power
generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset
position/market intelligence.  It occurred to me that there is an analogy
here that relates to pipelines.

Pipelines have operational ""events"" that may have  market effects:
    Unplanned outage  (major/minor/duration/notice)
   Planned outages over a certain volume
   Operation flow order/ SOLs
   Key Plants backed in
   Takes over schedule volumes key points
   Linepack levels
   Pressure drops at key points

Since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through  gas needed for
operational purchases - it is rationale that these phenomena would  be
studied and acted (read traded) upon in order to minimize TW's market risk
(read generate income).  TW can setup a risk management group to execute
this idea. It is not unusual for a pipeline to  have a risk management
function -  Duke Pipeline for example has a VP of  Risk Management for
Pipelines.

These ""events"" would be studied in the follow way -

1. Determine whether there is a correlation between  an  ""event"" and gas
prices/basis differentials. - based on historical  data.
2.  For those events that have a strong  correlations, develop a trading
strategy around the relationship.
3.  Back-test the trading strategy against  historical data - determine
profitability.
4.  For operational ""events"" that are  applicable, setup a system to
execute program trading that is directly linked to  SCADA.


Secondary benefits of this risk management (trading) strategy, would be
developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of selling
the capacity physical vs. through basis derivatives. (or some  combination
of both)

Steve, if you are interested in this idea I can  start drawing up a
workplan for this study.

Steve -

 I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options.  If your
team is available I could come by next Friday mid-morning or later  to
start discussing  with them.

On the administrative side, I am working to nail down the lowest hourly
rate I can get for you.  I would probably propose something like 80 hours *
rate, in the engagement letter.  This amount of time should be adequate to
put together a short study on your different options.  I will send you a
engagement letter this week.  I would just need to get that signed by you
before Friday.

Also, please let me know if you need any other information on the
Reliability Centered Maintenance idea, as you prepare to talk to the other
officers.

   Subject:  TW Earnings Idea - Twist on ECS Deals

   Hello Steve -

   Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick update - I
   moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months ago and
   have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management & Pipeline
   Optimization
   projects.

   I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.  Accenture has
   a
   strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability Centered
   Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology & technology for
   making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric T&D
   companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment.
   This
   is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:


   1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM
   2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)
   3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits from
   RCM
   (say $20MM) as part of our ""guarantee""
   4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over
   the
   next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.

   I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am around
   the
   Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to
   discuss
   further.

   Hope all is well.

"FW: Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles","The posting process as discussed below in Steve Kirks email is what we believe is the best way to handle the sale of any incremental Needles only capacity.  

 In regard to new generally available capacity, for example as a result of a ROFR contract not rolling over,  the capacity would be posted as generally available, and again, per the tariff we are not required to agree to amend a primary point.  We would suggest use of a posting/open season that follows the turnback capacity for sale with the parameters for bidding laid out, including the time period for which we are accepting bids.  If no acceptable bids are received, and a shipper asks to amend their primary point, the tariff provides the right to decline unless agreed.  However, if you have given a shipper the contractual right to change their primary point ie, request an available point, you will have to accept the request.   Hope this helps and concurs with our discussion today.

Subject:	Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles

Based upon our understanding of the request from TW Marketing, here is our suggested position on the posting and awarding of potential take-away capacity at SoCal Needles from approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.

TW would post on its website a notice in the capacity section that, based on information provided by SoCal regarding an expansion on their system, the take-away capacity at SoCal Needless may be increased by __Dth/day for the period of approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.  Shippers would be advised that the actual start date would depend on SoCal completing their system modifications. The posting would say that TW would accept requests for such capacity during a stated period of time (a minimum of 3 business days).  TW would award the capacity to the shipper(s) willing to provide the greatest cost commitment. The greatest cost commitment would be defined as those revenues above and beyond the current revenues which Transwestern already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.

Call me and I'll arrange for us to meet to discuss this further.   sjk

FERC has announced a technical conference for discusssion of allocation issues on El Paso's system for April 16, 2002.
Click below for the notice:

http://cips.ferc.gov/Q/CIPS/GAS/RP/RP00-336.002.TXT

At the public meeting on March 13, staff made a presentation, recommending that El Paso convert Full Requirements shippers to Contract Demand; provide capacity rights of the greater of billing determinant or coincidental peak; maintain the existing rate structure; maintain the 1996 settlement; and accept El Paso's proposed 20 pooling areas up from the existing 3 areas. Staff concluded that El Paso's firm service is unreliable and recommended the Commission set a technical conference.

Subject:	GRI for TW


I believe that, back in 1998, TW changed the way they handled GRI to assure that Reservation would not remit GRI if it was discounted.  That would have increased TW's margin on certain contracts.  But, the impact on margin would have declined by over 50% in 2001, when the Reservation GRI rate dropped from $.0066/day TO $.0030.  It will decrease again in 2002 when Reservation GRI becomes $.0018.

Do you have any estimate of how many dollars TW will ""lose"" as a result of the decline in GRI?
On 1-part discounted rates, I would assume that there would be little impact.  For example, if the market-driven rate is $.10 then TW couldn't get more than $.10 for the capacity, whether the max GRI surcharge were .0066 or .0018.

However, are there any long-term contracts where you collect GRI as part of the rate but do not remit it because of discounting?
For example, the discounted reservation rate is $.20 plus GRI.  TW billed $.2066 in 2000 but $.2030 in 2001 and $.2018 in 2002.
As long as the total rate is below max, TW keeps the GRI piece, but the revenue on the contract drops each year as the GRI component goes down.  (I don't know how many deals like this TW may have.  NNG has some.)

Subject: TW v. SoCalGas (Dictation Draft from Greg Porter)



DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER


I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.  Rick Miles will be the mediator.

The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Miles will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.

Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Once additional information is learned, I will advise.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"FYI  11/2001 TW Rate Matrix - same rates, different format","
Here is another matrix of TW ""Current Shipper"" rates & surcharges.
This one is not posted on the web.
I don't know whether anyone needs/uses it, anymore, but I have been keeping it up.
There is a new tab for each change in Current Shipper Rates.
The latest is ""200111""

Elizabeth - I forgot to send this to you this morning.  
Jeanette - I don't recall whether I sent this along with the other TW files.

There are files that back up the revenue projections that Steve Kleb gave me hard copies of for 2001 and 2002.  Can I get electronic copies of these, they have volumes and margins and appear to back up the revenue projections.   

2002 File looks like s\marketing\twfinmkt_anly\Tw\twfin\2001\misc\[plan_forecast_design.xls]\summary.  

2001 file looks like s\marketing\twfinmkt_anly\tw\twfin\2001\forecast-CE\[ce 3-2001.xls]model _source_data.    

If the same exists for 2000 can we get it as well.  I would like as soon as possible and you can email to the cc addresses as well.

Lisa brought up a TW change effective Nov 1.  It involves eliminating a turnback surcharge.  I have no other information, but you might check with the business folks for any system changes required.
