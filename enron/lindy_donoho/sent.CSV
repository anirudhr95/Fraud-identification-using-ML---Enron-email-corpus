   Steve -

   I worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my
   time, $175/hour (normal rate is $350).  I would like to send you an
   engagement letter this week for up to 3 weeks or 120 hours ($21k).  I
   think
   we can get it done in less time but the 120 hours provides some
   flexibility
   if we decide to go deeper on something -- we would only charge you for
   the
   hours we use.

   I am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring
   options as well as the NPV, Income, and operational effect for each.  To
   the extent time allows, I will be able to help negotiate and close
   whatever
   option you choose.

   In order for me to offer our preferred rate, it is important to note
   that I
   would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis
   (e.g. Friday meetings, emails, and phone vs. being on-site 3 weeks
   full-time).  Even with this flexible structure, I feel confident that we
   can have the deliverable complete by mid December.

   Please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with
   these
   terms.


   ========================

   As for the new idea ----

   I have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power
   generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset
   position/market intelligence.  It occurred to me that there is an
   analogy
   here that relates to pipelines.

   Pipelines have operational ""events"" that may have  market effects:
       Unplanned outage  (major/minor/duration/notice)
      Planned outages over a certain volume
      Operation flow order/ SOLs
      Key Plants backed in
      Takes over schedule volumes key points
      Linepack levels
      Pressure drops at key points

   Since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through  gas needed for
   operational purchases - it is rationale that these phenomena would  be
   studied and acted (read traded) upon in order to minimize TW's market
   risk
   (read generate income).  TW can setup a risk management group to execute
   this idea. It is not unusual for a pipeline to  have a risk management
   function -  Duke Pipeline for example has a VP of  Risk Management for
   Pipelines.

   These ""events"" would be studied in the follow way -

   1. Determine whether there is a correlation between  an  ""event"" and gas
   prices/basis differentials. - based on historical  data.
   2.  For those events that have a strong  correlations, develop a trading
   strategy around the relationship.
   3.  Back-test the trading strategy against  historical data - determine
   profitability.
   4.  For operational ""events"" that are  applicable, setup a system to
   execute program trading that is directly linked to  SCADA.


   Secondary benefits of this risk management (trading) strategy, would be
   developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of
   selling
   the capacity physical vs. through basis derivatives. (or some
   combination
   of both)

   Steve, if you are interested in this idea I can  start drawing up a
   workplan for this study.

   Steve -

    I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options.  If
   your
   team is available I could come by next Friday mid-morning or later  to
   start discussing  with them.

   On the administrative side, I am working to nail down the lowest hourly
   rate I can get for you.  I would probably propose something like 80
   hours *
   rate, in the engagement letter.  This amount of time should be adequate
   to
   put together a short study on your different options.  I will send you a
   engagement letter this week.  I would just need to get that signed by
   you
   before Friday.

   Also, please let me know if you need any other information on the

      Subject:  TW Earnings Idea - Twist on ECS Deals

      Hello Steve -

      Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick update -
   I
      moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months ago
   and
      have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management & Pipeline
      Optimization
      projects.

      I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.  Accenture
   has
      a
      strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability
   Centered
      Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology & technology
   for
      making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric T&D
      companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment.
      This
      is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:


      1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM
      2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)
      3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits from
      RCM
      (say $20MM) as part of our ""guarantee""
      4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over
      the
      next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.

      I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am
   around
      the
      Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to
      discuss
      further.

      Hope all is well.

The only thing I have to add, if this is our premise, Williams Field Services is not an ""owner"" of the Blanco Hub.  Only PNM, NWPL and Transwestern are owners and should be the only parties that can transport gas across the hub header system without a fee (because they are in effect transporting on their own pipeline).  I'm wondering if it's appropriate for WFS to have a ""hub"" agreement, if the purpose is for the Operator (TW) to be able identify transactions scheduled across the hub on the owners' capacity.

Lindy.

While testing the TMS nomination and scheduling processes that Interface into the new CMS system, I have found a TW Firm contract with Southern Energy Inc. # 26719 that was set up back in May or June of 2000 which has several alt. receipt templates that are outside the primary path. The primay path for this contract is San Juan Bloomfield receipts to Socal Needles as primary delivery. It shows up in production with alt. receipt groups in Central, West Texas, and Panhandle. Is this correct?

The GRI is a voluntary surcharge that the Shipper indicates they want to pay.  We just collect it and pass it on to the Gas Research institute.  The ACA is an Annual Charge Adjustment to recover cost charged to us by FERC.  We typically do not waive or discount this charge.  The other surcharges are due to past settlements and are not applicable to new expansion projects.  These are defined in the Tariff in sections 21 and 23 of the General Terms and Conditions.

On Sun Devil, are we required to collect GRI, ACA, or any other surcharges?  If so, how are they applied?  If not, why?

"RE: Hub Agreements","The only thing I have to add, if this is our premise, Williams Field Services is not an ""owner"" of the Blanco Hub.  Only PNM, NWPL and Transwestern are owners and should be the only parties that can transport gas across the hub header system without a fee (because they are in effect transporting on their own pipeline).  I'm wondering if it's appropriate for WFS to have a ""hub"" agreement, if the purpose is for the Operator (TW) to be able identify transactions scheduled across the hub on the owners' capacity.

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

Isn't our Sam a handsome boy!  He says pickle, boat, nose, eyes, daddy's car, grandma (this is when he's referring to Tony with a blanket wrapped around his head like a scarf), milk, water, beans, hush chloe & I get binky.  He is wonderful.

Sam & I are bonding this weekend.  The kids were all 3 going to NYC with Lisa for the weekend, but Anthony doesn't want to go.  So, he's staying with us, but he and Tony are going to the river in Utopia, TX to take Anthony deer hunting for the first time.  They're staying at Tony's grandma's house.  She's very excited to see them. Anthony is very excited and wanted to know if they could get him some ""camo"" Friday night (it's all about the clothes these days).

That's about all I know.  It's good that you're going into work and getting out of the house.  It sounds like you're hanging in there.  I hope you're able to get some more sleep.  I'm sure it won't seem soon enough, but you will get to sleep again sometime in the next year or so =)  (It does sound like a long time when you say it out loud.  Sorry.  It'll go by fast!)

I'm excited that Khalid will be baptized by your friend.  He sounds like an enlightened man and I think it's nice for him to recognize both your and Ahmed's faith.  Khalid is a lucky baby.  I wish we could be there.

Take care and tell Ahmed hi.  Give Khalid a kiss & a squeeze.

"RE: TW model","Sorry, I didn't see the questions below.

We were using historical rates (no fuel adjustment because we collect it in fuel sales) through 2006.  After 2006, I calculated an adjustment to add to the historical rates (assuming that we would recapture some of the value of the spread in the rate) and it made the rate greater than the max tariff rate.  Davis and I discussed that we didn't think we should assume anything in the models over max rate, so Davis said he would use the max rate after 2006.  (All of this is just pertaining to the West rates.)

The historical average West rate is $.2565.  The historical West rate with fuel adjustment added is $.3404.  The max rate is $.2868.

It's the same thing someone commented below (in blue) in response to the question - ""if we are at average rates we would be able to get it  back (fuel over-retention) up to the max rate number.""

Attached is the model incorporating the changes.
1)	have implemented 50% undivided interest concept
2)	Cash flow detail is as follows:
a.	85mm in operating cash flow
b.	18mm net from release of ENE receivable/payable
c.	137.5mm equity infusion
d.	(137.5mm) debt repayment
e.	85mm in new debt (to bring debt to target levels)
f.	185mm equity dividend (to bring equity to target levels)
3)	I've used the income detail tab to ratio taxes appropriately
4)	I've made reg amort $6.8mm per Bob.  Regulatory asset remains on books thru 2011.
5)	?
6)	Not including interest expense, proforma ROE is in the 12.5% to 13.5% range.  Rod, debt capital was not invested in a project with returns exceeding cost of debt, therefore ROE dropped with leverage.  Agreed, this is backwards from intuitive result.

Subject:	RE: TW model

Please see comments below:

1) We should probably show TransPecos as an undivided ownership interest as opposed to an investment in JV.  That way, the revenues and costs will be picked up above the line and can be analyzed with the other revenues.  Looks like we are properly picking up the capex from TransPecos in our capex additions already.  
I might be missing something, but I only see two accounting ways to handle TransPecos - equity method investment (as shown), or consolidated with 50% minority interests.  In the former case our debt holdings are understated, and in the latter they're overstated.  My guess is that the JV will be accounted for as shown.  In terms of capex, currently I have TW picking up 50% of the capex (starting equity basis).  Not to be flip, but I'm not sure which accounting method would let us pick up half the revenues and half the costs.  If we had an undivided interest we would have 50% of the deal on our books, debt and all.

Please let me know which method I should use. 


2) The equity balance did not seem to change for the $137,500,000 equity infusion.     Was this treated as equity in to repay or just an extinguishment? 
There was $184mm in excess cash that was dividended back out.  The model had to increase borrowings and pay a dividend to get the debt/equity ratio to 50% after the infusion.   It would seem to me that if there was 137,500,000 coming in that it needed to be paid to reduce the corresponding debt, so where did the excess cash come from?
 
3) Let's grow Other Taxes by 1%   Should grow by the same percentage as either revenues or net plant.   For most pipes these are property/earnings dependent and are derived from the uitlity operating income line on the form 2 for the most part.
I need to fix the model to make ""other taxes"" a function of ppe.  I'll make it a constant rate based on year 1.  Rod reminds me that part of that is probably gross receipts - I'll go back to the  planning models and try to figure out a relative proportion.    Also a part is payroll taxes.    Tracy could probably break it apart for you.

4) Question for TG, Reg Am was only $7.6 million in 2002 but $16.5 million going forward.   All Reg Am should disappear with the new rate case. 
that's why we had to increase it so much - so that it amortizes to zero by 2006.  Note that it is non-cash, non-tax, but it represents a large reduction in equity.    Then there must be a problem elsewhere, since it is supposed to be gone by itself.

5) Question for LD/SH on the 2006 drop in revenues by approx. $15 million.  Detail schedules show why, just want to make sure it makes sense.
That's an item that Lindy's following up on, but probably the whole group needs to consider.  Our fuel retention goes away after '06, the question is whether ""max rates"" should add in the revenues that we derived from fuel retention or not.  The interpretation in the model is that ""max rates"" means our max published reservation fee only, meaning that we lose $15mm of fuel retention after '06.    If we are at max rates, then that would be the result, however if we are at average rates we would be able to get it back up to the max rate number.

6) ROE questions/cases -

	Let's show after ROE, the ROE without the effect of the additional debt that was added in Nov. 2001.  This obviously dropped the ROE from 12-13% to 10%.  If Cooper is successfully in coming out with no debt on TW (it should not have been there in the first place!), the ROE will be much higher.  In addition, reducing equity by the $137,500,000 should also improve the ROE substantially.    ?
I'll run a line that adds back tax-adjusted interest expense in the ROE calc, the $137.5mm was handled as above.   This is not intuitive.   The ROE should be bigger with debt, unless the ROE is less than the cost of debt.     Debt up, equity down, ROE up?

Subject:	FW: Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles

The posting process as discussed below in Steve Kirks email is what we believe is the best way to handle the sale of any incremental Needles only capacity.  

 In regard to new generally available capacity, for example as a result of a ROFR contract not rolling over,  the capacity would be posted as generally available, and again, per the tariff we are not required to agree to amend a primary point.  We would suggest use of a posting/open season that follows the turnback capacity for sale with the parameters for bidding laid out, including the time period for which we are accepting bids.  If no acceptable bids are received, and a shipper asks to amend their primary point, the tariff provides the right to decline unless agreed.  However, if you have given a shipper the contractual right to change their primary point ie, request an available point, you will have to accept the request.   Hope this helps and concurs with our discussion today.

Subject:	Increased Take-away at SoCal Needles

Based upon our understanding of the request from TW Marketing, here is our suggested position on the posting and awarding of potential take-away capacity at SoCal Needles from approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.

TW would post on its website a notice in the capacity section that, based on information provided by SoCal regarding an expansion on their system, the take-away capacity at SoCal Needless may be increased by __Dth/day for the period of approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.  Shippers would be advised that the actual start date would depend on SoCal completing their system modifications. The posting would say that TW would accept requests for such capacity during a stated period of time (a minimum of 3 business days).  TW would award the capacity to the shipper(s) willing to provide the greatest cost commitment. The greatest cost commitment would be defined as those revenues above and beyond the current revenues which Transwestern already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.

Call me and I'll arrange for us to meet to discuss this further.   sjk

Mary Kay,

I found your contact information from the Transwestern Pipeline Company
website at the contact for Certificates. I work in the Enron building in
Houston in Weather Risk, and yesterday I received a phone call from a
customer (BP Chemicals in Green Lake Texas) looking for a certificate of
analysis for natural gas sold to them by Enron. I was unable to get much
information from the customer, other than a station ID0981367, and the
location. I am very new to Enron, and have tried to find the correct
person to redirect BP's request to. Do you by chance know who the
correct contact is?

Thank you for any help you might be able to provide.

Sincerely,

Please take this and run with it and find out what the best solution is.  We need information on what the different options are and what the best solution is for January implementation of the change.  Let me know what help you might need.  The major impact seems to be to TMS and Accounting, with minor affects to CRS and CMS (determining credit and gaining the correct max rate).  We really need to have the solution defined by the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, or earlier if possible.

Thanks a bunch and let me know.

I wanted to clarify on the item related to the West of Thoreau area.
To me, I think that we could create a new Basin in PLE and call it East of California. The area is still W. of Thoreau with two basins in that area. Maybe  check with Elizabeth to make sure she agrees. I have attached the POI view of one of the points that should be changed to the East of California basin. Let me know what you think.

- the amount of the rebates you have been receiving from ECS for Gallup

- copies of all the ECS agreements (Bisti, Bloomfield, Gallup, WT1,

- Hubbard run hours and payments ECS - last 3 years [you can ask John Sturn
for this]
- Projected amount of TW fuel over collection 2002
- A list of the other ETS electric compressors [John Sturn]
- Total non-compressor related electric charges ETS paid in 2000 and 2001 -
someone in Wasaff's group should have this / or someone in Omaha.

Lindy, Tony and Sam: 

Thank you very much for the fun visit this past weekend.  Of course the highlight of our trip was being with Sam.  I don't have to tell you we really miss that bright, shining face!  It's amazing how quickly you become attached.  When we woke up Tuesday morning we both said how much we already missed being able to be with him.  He spoiled us quickly.  I told Lisa and John they should go and visit to enjoy his adorable personality and fun age.  

Our trip home was not what we expected, but it could have been worse.  Going through Chicago seemed a round about way to get to Omaha from Houston, but it worked out fine and we arrived here only about 2 hours later than the original schedule.  Flying can definitely be an adventure.

I not only miss Sam, but I miss your warm weather too!  It is cold and dreary today and the weatherman said we will probably have snow tonight and tomorrow.  I shouldn't complain--this winter has been wonderful.  But at the same time I truly enjoyed not having to wear a coat.  

I know you are looking forward to having the next two days off from work (plus the weekend).  

Thanks again for the nice visit.  We really had a good time.  Give Sam hugs and kisses from us.  We miss all of you! 

Love you.

	Thank you so much for sharing!  I can't tell you what a sweet boy he is!! I have the picture of him today (with his eyes open) as my screen saver.  Everyone in my office is in love with Khalid!
	Well, I hope you are okay and have maybe caught up on some sleep.  Hopefully, Khalid will be a good sleeper.  I told Amy that this was enough to make me want to get on a plane.  Maybe Tony, Sam & I will be able to come visit soon.  I'm so excited that Sam will have a cousin near his age.  He has Riley (turned 2 yrs. on Oct 4th) and Peyton (was 3 yrs. in June) who are brothers and live in San Antonio (Tony's brother Larry's boys).  But we are thinking that we've never been to Memphis and it would be a great place to visit!
	Sam is doing wonderfully.  As everyone will tell you, they grow up so fast.  Just enjoy every moment - these boys are little miracles!  Sam has started saying alot of words (moon, house, ball, cookie, crackers, buckle) and he is going to be a lion for halloween - he's been practicing his roar.  What will Khalid be?  Sam is also trying to put on his shoes and socks.  He is fascinated with buckles - he can buckle, but not unbuckle yet.  He is almost riding his tricycle.
	Everything else is good here.  My mom and Charlie have started driving here today.  They will get to Houston tomorrow night.  Tony is driving the Corvair in a parade Saturday and then, of course, we are watching the Baylor game.
	I'm so glad to hear your mom and dad are coming this weekend.  I bet they cannot wait.  I hope they are able to visit often.  It is so important to me that Sam knows my mom, Charlie, my dad & Flo.  I was so lucky to get to grow-up with my grandparents in town and I wish that Sam will have the same.
	Have fun with sweet Khalid and take care of Amy.  It sounds like you all are doing great!

Love,
Lindy

What period does the max rate assumption cover. The comment that troubles me more is that we are fully contracted West thru 2005. That is not true.

"RE: Slide #11","You are correct.  I've got my units confused - the amount on slide #11 should be 110 MMcfd.  

On the San Juan slide #14, I've left out a phrase from the report.  The report reads "" total basin wellhead production peaked in 1999 at 4.3 Bcf/cd and is expected to decline almost 22%,  about 2.4% per year, to 3.4 Bcf/cd by 2010"".  In the tabular information of the study, 1999 begins with 4,306 MMcf/d and 2010 ends with 3,351 MMcf/d.

My question on slide 11 may be an issue of units.  If the increase is from 6400 MMcfd to 7500 MMcfd, should the increase amount be 110 MMcfd vs 110000MMcfd?

Separately, on slide 14, can you tell me how the 2.4% decline is calculated?  If it is based on the 4.3 Bcfd down to 3.5 Bcfd shouldn't it be a 1.8% decline?

Subject:	Slide #11

The note ""need to verify"" appears on this slide, after the bullet ""110,000 MMcfd annual average increase"".

I calculated this average annual amount from the first bullet ""CA's natural gas use will increase from 6,400 MMcfd in 2000 to 7,500 MMcfd in 2010"".  The first bullet and the third bullet are from the same source as the graph, The California Energy Commission.  Specifically, it's from their ""California Natural Gas Analysis and Issues"" Staff Report, dated November 2000.  The CEC's more current report from October, 2001, did not include specific long-term demand projections (it is focused on infrastructure issues).

That's the source of the numbers on this slide.

Please take this and run with it and find out what the best solution is.  We need information on what the different options are and what the best solution is for January implementation of the change.  Let me know what help you might need.  The major impact seems to be to TMS and Accounting, with minor affects to CRS and CMS (determining credit and gaining the correct max rate).  We really need to have the solution defined by the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, or earlier if possible.

Thanks a bunch and let me know.

I wanted to clarify on the item related to the West of Thoreau area.
To me, I think that we could create a new Basin in PLE and call it East of California. The area is still W. of Thoreau with two basins in that area. Maybe  check with Elizabeth to make sure she agrees. I have attached the POI view of one of the points that should be changed to the East of California basin. Let me know what you think.

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

I calculated this average annual amount from the first bullet ""CA's natural gas use will increase from 6,400 MMcfd in 2000 to 7,500 MMcfd in 2010"".  The first bullet and the third bullet are from the same source as the graph, The California Energy Commission.  Specifically, it's from their ""California Natural Gas Analysis and Issues"" Staff Report, dated November 2000.  The CEC's more current report from October, 2001, did not include specific long-term demand projections (it is focused on infrastructure issues).

That's the source of the numbers on this slide.

Lindy, you have received the revised Blanco Hub Partnership 2002 O&M Budget (Overheads corrected).  I'm working with Devon Hunt with NWPL on the La Plata A/Ignacio Pipeline 2002 O&M Budget to correct the overheads on it.  Everything else on the Operating Budget was agreed on by the Partners as John stated, only the overhead amount has to be revised.  As soon as I get this straightened out I'll send you the corrected budget.

Whatever was the agreed to budget for 2001 on the Blanco Hub and whatever that flat fee is for the 3 years on the La Plata Facilities.

Perry had asked me whether this contract had ROFR or not because he thinks it should be terminated, but CAS is still reserving capacity for the contract because it has a ROFR flag on it in CBS.  I think that this contract does not have ROFR, but could you confirm this for me?  If my memory is correct, I thought that this agreement was always done just a month or two at a time and that at the end of each term it was negotiated with the price desk (& more recently TK) to roll for another month or so.  If I'm thinking of the right contract, that would mean that it did not have a ROFR (because it was not for a year or longer) and that it terminated 3/31/2001.

Could you check the contract file for me and look at the amendment history to confirm that the agreement did not have a year or longer term?  If not, then this agreement should not have the ROFR contract on it.

Let me know.  Thanks!

"Hello from Houston, Texas","Amy & Ahmed,
	Sorry it's taken me so long to reply.  Thank you for the darling pictures of Khalid.  I'm going to have to change my screensaver here at work because I still have one of the ""washed in stardust"" pic's and of course he's totally changed!  He's so handsome and has such a pretty complexion - and those beautiful, big, brown eyes - what a sweetheart!
	We had a great visit with ""PaPaFlo""!  Dad (Cal our Dad) taught Sam to jump (sort of) and now he's unable to just walk anywhere, but has to jump his way where ever he goes (thanks Dad!).  I think PaPaFlo (which now refers to your mom and Dad simultaneaously) got satisfactorily worn-out by their toddling grandson.  We went on the slide, ""go to swingies"", ""play-da-cars"", ""draw-da-picture"", ""play-da-firetruck"", ""ride-da-wagon"" and ""read-da-book"" - and I was happy to hear PaPaFlo proceeding each of those phrases rather than Mommy.  Sam is busy!
	I heard Khalid had a cough.  I hope that clears up soon.  I also heard you were looking at a new house.  That's exciting - I'm sure you could use the room.  Good luck with that!
	Tony is on the third week of his new job.  It seems to be going well.  He was bored, but now they gave him two houses in the sheetrock stage to finish.  I hope Ahmed's new job is good too.  Amy, I heard your job was working well from a flexibility standpoint with Khalid.  That is really a blessing.
	I won't mention how my job is going, except I'm still here and we don't know anything you don't know.
	We were sad to hear about Mr. Sutton.
	The kids are all fine.  Missy was disappointed she didn't get to see your mom and Dad while they were here.  She probably thought she might get a present =)
	I need to get out the digital camara and get some new pic's of Sam.  I'll try to get those your way soon.  I'm sure Dad & Flo will have some from their visit too.

Take care!
Love,
Lindy, Tony, Sam & the kids

Subject: Pictures & News from Khalid


Hi Everyone:

Khalid is doing great and is a very happy baby.  As you can see from the pictures, he loves to laugh and smile at his Daddy!

He is still on his same schedule.  He sleeps every night from about 8:00 PM until 7:00 AM.  He loves to go to bed at night.  If it is after 8:00 PM he is rubbing his eyes and looking for his bed!  He likes to sleep in but if it is past 7:30 AM, we have to wake him up!

He eats 8 oz. 4 times per day - at 7:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 3:00 PM and 7:00 PM.  He is definitely a growing boy - hardly any of his clothes fit anymore!  His 3-6 month clothes just fit him but will not for very much longer.  I have started buying him 6-9 month clothes.  He still does not like socks or anything on his feet - he kicks them right off.

He loves to put his hands in his mouth and suck on them.  He also still loves to look at all of his toys in his bed and his all-time favorite is definitely still his mobil!

His teachers at school tell Ahmed and me that he is the best baby there.  They definitely have some babies that are ""high maintenance"" but Khalid is not one of them.  He loves his teacher, Miss Janice, and smiles at her all the time.

We have noticed lately that he really likes to watch football - we have no idea where he would have picked that up :)

Khalid likes to go outside for walks both at school and at home when it is nice outside.  Our weather has been in the high 50's and low 60's so we have been going a lot.  It is great exercise for me and Khalid likes to be on the move!

Ahmed and I are doing great - enjoying these last couple of weeks of football before we go into mourning for 7 months!

Khalid sends his love to each and every one of you.  We hope to see all of you soon.

Love,
Amy, Ahmed & Khalid

TK could you update these prices for me for the Stan Presentation (one more time - it's due to Tracy on Thurs)?

I don't need the historical NYMEX again, unless Vernon has the NYMEX settle price for Jan - Sept '01 (Weren't the historical numbers from last week Inside FERC because we were having a system problem?)

I need them by tomorrow after lunch.  I'm in a meeting from 8:00 to 12:00 tomorrow.  If you have any questions, leave me a voicemail - I'll check it during break.

"Happy Birthday Miss Margy","Happy birthday to you!  Happy birthday to you!  Happy birthday dear Margy, happy birthday to you!

How are you?  Brett?  Shayne & Summer?  Your family?  I hope everyone is well and coping with all that has happened.  We are fine down here.  My mom & Charlie are coming for a visit next week.  They were flying, but now they're driving.  I think we could all get into the whole family truckster thing again.  Tony & I have decided we probably need the van with the TV/VCR in the ceiling now.  By the way, how is Summer?  What did the doctor have to say about her germ thing, etc?  I hope you all are working through that ok.

I hope you are doing something special for your birthday - going out to dinner with your family & kids and/or maybe a night out with just Brett & you - there's a treat!  Tony & I got a babysitter (one of Sam's teachers) last Saturday for no particular reason and just went out to eat & to a movie (Serendipity - it was a cute romantic comedy.  Just about all I need these days - light & funny & not too much brain power.)

Well, please take the time to celebrate this day - the day we all lucked out and you were born!  Tell Brett it really was his lucky day!  Spend some time with your mom & dad - they were both there =)  And remember the best birthday gift you ever got - the gift of this life - what more wonderful thing could there be?  It was a gift to all of us that have the pure pleasure of knowing you, Margy.  My life would not be the same without you =)

I love you & miss you, my friend.

"RE: soCalGas Complaint"," 

It looks good!  I had a few comments on pages 7 & 9.

Also, on page 13 - # 26 & 27, is there any benefit to more specifically describing why we ""understood"" and why they ""knew"" that the San Juan lateral contract would be base loaded due to their long-term firm supply arrangement with Pan Alberta that existed prior to and after the Global Settlement rates were negotiated?  FERC is aware of this longstanding and complex arrangement involving PGT, NWPL, TW, Pan Alberta, SoCal and SoCal's affiliate, PITCO.  It would seem a huge oversight on SoCal's part that this lower rate they supposedly negotiated and agreed to with TW was not memorialized in the Global Settlement or in TW's tariff.  This is a rate that applies to two-thirds of the volumes SoCal transports under contract 8255 and allegedly SoCal and TW had some verbal agreement (with a 10 year term) that would apply to these volumes.

"Scheduling Alt FT by Price","Per our discussions yesterday, I did find an Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. Order On Rehearing in my file, dated August 5, 1997 in Docket No. RP97-126-002 (80 FERC P61,199) concerning scheduling alt FT by price.  On reviewing it again, some key points were:  

	Allocate based on the highest percentage of the maximum rate - the rate used being the rate for the package of services that includes those secondary rights.
	The Commission maintains that all firm capacity, once scheduled, be curtailed pro rata, without regard to price.

Panhandle also filed on March 14, 1997 for scheduling alt FT by price at Docket No. RP97-291 (it's referenced in footnotes, but I don't have a copy of the filing).

"Suggestion - Bed Bugs","Just wanted to let you know I had a phone message from Nancy Mallard(sp?) today.  Her daughter is a bunny.  She had a suggestion for the basket.  The James Avery catalog has some sterling silver charms (for a bracelet or a necklace) that are bugs.  A dragon fly ($17.50), a honey bee ($12.50) and a lady bug ($15).

I left her a message and told her I thought it sounded like a great idea.  I told her we would get back with her after next week (& collecting donations) to see if she would like to purchase one to donate for the basket or if she could provide us with the catalog (because I don't receive that one).  I've already looked on the internet to see if I could get a look.  Apparently, there's not a website.

FYI, we'll touch-base later.

"Installation of Pigging Facilities","I have reviewed the La Plata Facilities O&O Agreement.  Lee, could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment?  It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following:

Special Services.  This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator (TW) and the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives).  If NWPL agreed, their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest.  If we did obtain their approval, future O&M cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners.  (We've agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 3.5% escalator starting in 2001.) 

Addition or Expansion.  Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity. We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate.  If they participate, they share in the cost at their ownership interest, but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest.  If they don't indicate a desire to participate in 60 days, we can proceed with the Expansion (without any approval, but also no cost sharing).  Also, any incremental O&M associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion.

I think if we went the Special Services route, we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels.  I think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost.  (They probably don't have $260,000 ($1.5MM * .174) sitting around in a budget somewhere that they'd like to fork over for these facilities.)  Rich, what do you think?  How difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities?

Recommendation:  To save us the 60 days notice period of an Expansion, I think we should notify them that it's a necessary Special Service and ask for approval (& to pass along their share of the cost), but to be prepared to eat 100% of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities.  In this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future O&M attributable to these facilities.

FYI, their ownership interest is still officially 22.3% since they have not executed the Amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times, first by me and twice by Lynn Blair.  If	they execute the Amendment that incorporates the 4/1/98 expansion of the facilities, their ownership interest will be 17.4%.

"OBA & Scheduling Alt FT by Price Tariff Filings","In an effort to get cash in the door for TW and to maximize revenue opportunity for TW in the coming year, I think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the FERC as soon as possible. 

One would be the OBA filing we have been discussing (and trying to support with historical data) to get automatic cash-out on OBA's in ""constrained"" areas on TW.

Second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate FT points.  This may be the time (the market to California is not so hot) to try to implement this.  I know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them.  

Glen is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the OBA tariff filing.  Could we discuss scheduling alternate FT by price at the same meeting?

"Resubscription Rates in 2010 Plan","I would recommend the following assumptions for capacity resubscription from now through Q3 2006:

The historical average rates should be assumed for the resubscription of East and Ignacio to Blanco capacity rolling-off during this time period.  The forward curves that have been discussed represent the value of capacity to California, not East to East or Ignacio to Blanco capacity.  I don't think that max rates for the capacity represented in these groups is appropriate.

The max rate at $.1020 is appropriate for the San Juan group.

The appropriate max rate for the West group is $.2868.

The volume of Ignacio to Blanco capacity available for resubscription should be reduced.  Today, we have contracts from Ignacio to the Blanco Hub that then continue on Transwestern on another contract.  (These contracts existed before Transwestern owned this line and were assigned to Transwestern when we purchased the facilities from NWPL.)  Because of this ""artificial break"" in the contracts, Transwestern is collecting the San Juan lateral rate once on a contract from Ignacio to Blanco and then again on another contract from Blanco to Thoreau (or to the CA border).  In the future, when this capacity is resubscribed, the contracts will most likely not be split at the Blanco Hub and Transwestern will only extract the San Juan lateral rate once from Ignacio to Thoreau (or to the CA border).  Jan and I will look at the Ignacio capacity that has historically continued on Transwestern south of the Blanco Hub (vs. delivering to El Paso at Blanco).  We will come up with a % to be applied to the Ignacio to Blanco capacity that should be resubscribed at a zero rate (or the capacity to be resubscribed can be reduced - whichever is easier to put in the model).

"Ctrc 24690 Continental CMS","Perry had asked me whether this contract had ROFR or not because he thinks it should be terminated, but CAS is still reserving capacity for the contract because it has a ROFR flag on it in CBS.  I think that this contract does not have ROFR, but could you confirm this for me?  If my memory is correct, I thought that this agreement was always done just a month or two at a time and that at the end of each term it was negotiated with the price desk (& more recently TK) to roll for another month or so.  If I'm thinking of the right contract, that would mean that it did not have a ROFR (because it was not for a year or longer) and that it terminated 3/31/2001.

Could you check the contract file for me and look at the amendment history to confirm that the agreement did not have a year or longer term?  If not, then this agreement should not have the ROFR contract on it.

Thanks for everyone's help on this and I apologize for being so late in answering back . We've been on team reviews for the last couple of weeks, doing reviews during the day and traveling to next location. I agree that we should approach them from the Special Service side. At this time we have our yearly meeting set up for Nov. 12th but this could change. Todd Stubbs is ready but Bob Checketts is having problems scheduling this week. He's tied up on a security task force for their company. Todd should let me know this week if we're still on for the 12th.  Lindy do you or someone else plan to attend the meeting? If not I'll plan to visit with Todd and see how he reacts to the facility upgrade if that's OK with everyone. I'm still not sure if we plan to do this next year but will find out this week and let you know.

Normally we have our meeting by September 1st but NW was setting it up this year and November was targeted for a meeting. I'll give you a call on Monday and we can discuss. Do you think we need a conference call to discuss?

Thanks

Subject:	Installation of Pigging Facilities

I have reviewed the La Plata Facilities O&O Agreement.  Lee, could you please review the same and see if you agree with this assessment?  It appears to me that the pigging facilties could qualify as either of the following:

Special Services.  This would be subject to prior written consent and agreement between the Operator (TW) and the Operating Committee (TW & NWPLRepresentatives).  If NWPL agreed, their share of the cost would be in proportion to their ownership interest.  If we did obtain their approval, future O&M cost attributable to the pigging facilities could be shared among the owners.  (We've agreed to a flat fee for 2000 through 2003 with a 3.5% escalator starting in 2001.) 

Addition or Expansion.  Demonstrate that the pigging will add incremental transmission capacity. We have to give notice to NWPL and they have 60 days to participate.  If they participate, they share in the cost at their ownership interest, but they get a share of the incremental capacity at their ownership interest.  If they don't indicate a desire to participate in 60 days, we can proceed with the Expansion (without any approval, but also no cost sharing).  Also, any incremental O&M associated with an expansion cannot be passed on to any owners not participating in such expansion.

I think if we went the Special Services route, we would need to justify the need for these facilities to maintain the integrity and efficiency of the facilities at current levels.  I think we would spend alot of time arguing this with them and in the end they would probably approve it subject to them not incurring any cost.  (They probably don't have $260,000 ($1.5MM * .174) sitting around in a budget somewhere that they'd like to fork over for these facilities.)  Rich, what do you think?  How difficult would it be to demonstrate that these facilities are necessary for maintaining the current operating levels of the facilities?

Recommendation:  To save us the 60 days notice period of an Expansion, I think we should notify them that it's a necessary Special Service and ask for approval (& to pass along their share of the cost), but to be prepared to eat 100% of the costs to obtain their timely approval and proceed with the installation of the facilities.  In this event we would need to agree on the inclusion of future O&M attributable to these facilities.

FYI, their ownership interest is still officially 22.3% since they have not executed the Amendment that has been tendered to them 3 times, first by me and twice by Lynn Blair.  If	they execute the Amendment that incorporates the 4/1/98 expansion of the facilities, their ownership interest will be 17.4%.

Subject:	OBA & Scheduling Alt FT by Price Tariff Filings

In an effort to get cash in the door for TW and to maximize revenue opportunity for TW in the coming year, I think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the FERC as soon as possible. 

One would be the OBA filing we have been discussing (and trying to support with historical data) to get automatic cash-out on OBA's in ""constrained"" areas on TW.

Second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate FT points.  This may be the time (the market to California is not so hot) to try to implement this.  I know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them.  

Glen is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the OBA tariff filing.  Could we discuss scheduling alternate FT by price at the same meeting?

"WTX Pool Capacity","I don't know if Perry has responded to your request yet concerning what contracts are expiring with WTX Pool capacity and about that Duke contract you mentioned in our Staff Mtg yesterday, but I looked at my notes and this is what I come up with.

The Duke contract that expires 7/31/2002 without ROFR is already taken into consideration as expired in the November, 2002 capacity of 17,300/d we derived last week (which we've already sold 20,000/d to Calpine & PPL).

Other contracts expiring in 2002 & early 2003 from the WTX Pool are:

	25841	PG&E	17,200/d	10/31/2002	(ROFR trigger 10/31/01)
	26511	PG&E	  8,165/d	10/31/2002	(ROFR trigger 10/31/01)
	Total		25,365/d

	26683	APS	8,000/d		3/31/2003	(subject to ROFR)
		
Otherwise, we have WTX Pool capacity every Apr-Oct of 14,000/d (opposite of SWG's seasonal ctrc).

The other issue we could take into consideration here is displacement.  For the month of November, 2002 (for example) we have 22,000/d of capacity we are including in our WT-1 total that is made up of southward paths (20,000/d for USGT & 2,000/d for Astra with receipts north of WT-1 for delivery to WTX delivery points south of WT-2).  This is the most conservative capacity reservation policy.  In the event not enought physical receipts were nominated south of WT-1 to fulfill all physical deliveries nominated south of WT-1, we would need to compress gas south through WT-1 to make deliveries for these two contracts.  We may want to reassess this.

Subject:	RE: Two proceeding changes

Christi --  I don't think it changes the requirement to file by October 1 either, and we are proceeding under the same schedule.  Several rehearing requests were submitted, including one for ENA/EES.  However, note the following which I sent out in an earlier message to the ENA/EES western commercial and government affairs folks (I noted you deleted your message without reading it.)  I consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this OMB ruling a good sign.  


As detailed in the attached FERC notice, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved FERC's Information Collection Request for ""Reporting of Natural Gas Sales to the California Market"" through the six-month emergency period that will expire on 1/31/02.  (Emergency reporting requirements are automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations.)  However, it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the reporting requirements could be extended.

OMB has advised FERC that, if it decides to request renewal of the Information Collection Request after that date, it must address certain issues as part of its supporting statement (more specifically, ""include an explicit discussion"").  As you may remember, in addition to requesting rehearing of the FERC order, ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems with FERC's estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed collection of information.  We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements, much less keep our records in that manner.  We manage our business on an aggregated basis, and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significant manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale.  We stated that we might even have to hire full-time staff to dedicate to the task.

The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requires FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the reporting requirements past 1/31/02.  (FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through 9/30/02 to coincide with the end date of its mitigation plan.)  OMB questioned the practical utility of requiring disaggregated data when ""commenters"" reported that they did not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way.  OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant data manipulation in order to respond, and the resulting disaggregation would likely be artificial.  OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden estimates after ""consulting with respondents"", and it must provide a list of the names, affiliates, and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted.

FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request.  While we would not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely, it may be that the OMB action will affect their final decision.  At the least, it sends a signal!

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

I'm asking Ramona a question - it would probably be good if I had her on the address list =)

Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

Let me know your comments.

Subject:	Summary of NOI


Attached is an executive summary of the NOI on Electronic Service of Documents, RM01-11. Essentially, FERC wants to expand service electronically to allow individuals to receive documents through email without the need for interventions just to be kept informed of the proceedings. FERC is making two proposals, one for service to parties and one for service to individuals for a cost (FERC states cost recovery but no specifics).

Comments are due November 2. Joe has asked that I coordinate comments for our pipelines. Let me know who you wish to participate.

Hi Kim, I was referred to you by Audrey Robertson. 

I work for Morris Brassfield in his Contracts Administration dept. He has asked me to pull and make copies of all the O&M agreements for TW  that are being billed monthly so that we can review. 

The following is a list of O&M agreements that I am looking for. 

ECT/Bisti
ECT/Bloomfield
PNM Gas Services/Blanco Hub
Northwest Pipeline/Blanco Hub
Northwest Pipeline/La Plata

Would you have or know who would have the original executed agreements so that I can make copies for the Contracts department.  If you do have them I would be glad to go and make the copies myself.


Thanks,

Subject:	RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding 

I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about ""Shipper Imbalances"" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order (""OFO"") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates.
For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million

"FW: Bus Applications Meeting Follow Up","I believe what Lisa (Sawyer?) was referring to is the termination of TW's shared cost surcharge effective October 31, 2001.  I don't think there would be any system changes required.  Typically, TW's rates are entered with a start and end date and (if this is correct) the surcharge should have an end date of 10/31/2001 and there wouldn't be anything else to do.  If it's not entered that way, an end date could be entered now (whether at the surcharge level or at the contract level - the surcharge applies to just 14 firm contracts) and that should take care of it.

Elizabeth,  Is this correct?  I know you're on a project, please let me know if you can check this or who can.

These contracts were then dropped after 2005.  I continued the 	extensions through 2006.

	I changed the East of Thoreau capacity to 750,000/d from 850,000/d.

Steve -

I worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my
time, $175/hour (normal rate is $350).  I would like to send you an
engagement letter this week for up to 3 weeks or 120 hours ($21k).  I think
we can get it done in less time but the 120 hours provides some flexibility
if we decide to go deeper on something -- we would only charge you for the
hours we use.

I am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring
options as well as the NPV, Income, and operational effect for each.  To
the extent time allows, I will be able to help negotiate and close whatever
option you choose.

In order for me to offer our preferred rate, it is important to note that I
would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis
(e.g. Friday meetings, emails, and phone vs. being on-site 3 weeks
full-time).  Even with this flexible structure, I feel confident that we
can have the deliverable complete by mid December.

Please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with these
terms.


========================

As for the new idea ----

I have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power
generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset
position/market intelligence.  It occurred to me that there is an analogy
here that relates to pipelines.

Pipelines have operational ""events"" that may have  market effects:
    Unplanned outage  (major/minor/duration/notice)
   Planned outages over a certain volume
   Operation flow order/ SOLs
   Key Plants backed in
   Takes over schedule volumes key points
   Linepack levels
   Pressure drops at key points

Since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through  gas needed for
operational purchases - it is rationale that these phenomena would  be
studied and acted (read traded) upon in order to minimize TW's market risk
(read generate income).  TW can setup a risk management group to execute
this idea. It is not unusual for a pipeline to  have a risk management
function -  Duke Pipeline for example has a VP of  Risk Management for
Pipelines.

These ""events"" would be studied in the follow way -

1. Determine whether there is a correlation between  an  ""event"" and gas
prices/basis differentials. - based on historical  data.
2.  For those events that have a strong  correlations, develop a trading
strategy around the relationship.
3.  Back-test the trading strategy against  historical data - determine
profitability.
4.  For operational ""events"" that are  applicable, setup a system to
execute program trading that is directly linked to  SCADA.


Secondary benefits of this risk management (trading) strategy, would be
developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of selling
the capacity physical vs. through basis derivatives. (or some  combination
of both)

Steve, if you are interested in this idea I can  start drawing up a
workplan for this study.

Steve -

 I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options.  If your
team is available I could come by next Friday mid-morning or later  to
start discussing  with them.

On the administrative side, I am working to nail down the lowest hourly
rate I can get for you.  I would probably propose something like 80 hours *
rate, in the engagement letter.  This amount of time should be adequate to
put together a short study on your different options.  I will send you a
engagement letter this week.  I would just need to get that signed by you
before Friday.

Also, please let me know if you need any other information on the
Reliability Centered Maintenance idea, as you prepare to talk to the other
officers.

   Subject:  TW Earnings Idea - Twist on ECS Deals

   Hello Steve -

   Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick update - I
   moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months ago and
   have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management & Pipeline
   Optimization
   projects.

   I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.  Accenture has
   a
   strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability Centered
   Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology & technology for
   making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric T&D
   companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment.
   This
   is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:


   1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM
   2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)
   3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits from
   RCM
   (say $20MM) as part of our ""guarantee""
   4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over
   the
   next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.

   I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am around
   the
   Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to
   discuss
   further.

   Hope all is well.

Lindy:
The next parts that we will need some help on in the TW business plan is -

1) Risks - contract rolloffs and competitive threats
2) Growth opportunities (e.g. TransPecos, Sun Devil and the Bakersfield projects)
3) Marketing strategy

I have attached an updated Business Plan. Please insert your thoughts in the appropriate section - it may be helpful to talk about it first!
Thanks,

Kevin

Can we all plan to get on the phone with Maria tomorrow (Thurs) at 10:00 to discuss some questions with Elizabeth about East of CA?  We've apparently been inconsistent in our interpretation for different purposes (reporting and system mod's, etc.) and want to get it all straight.

Elizabeth, can you come to th 13th floor and then we'll grab a room/table/office and call Maria?

"FYI - 637 Imbal Mtg","We held a meeting to discuss the status of TW's 637 Imbalance filing.  Our current position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie.  We discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA ""wish list"" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing.

After further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly defined, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas.  If defined this narrowly, this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data.  We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing.

Glen & Mary are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with Rob.  Lyn & Terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe (Ignacio to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & check with Darrell for any other areas that should be included) and increased imbalance levels.  We plan to get together next week to discuss further.

Concerning the rest of our OBA ""wish list"", we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the Imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a ""settlement"" position on those issues to have ready in the event of Commission action in this docket.

"Capacity Posting Tariff Sheets","My other comments on the tariff sheets were as follows:

Section 35.2
	2nd paragraph, 3rd sentence.  Explanation of ""incremental revenue"".  When we talk about revenues which TW already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.  What if we're taking bids on future capacity and we're trying to get revenue that is incremental to reservations charges we're not necessarily being paid yet?  The language is so specific.  Can we change the language to refer to revenues incremental to what TW already has contractually committed?

	2nd paragraph, last sentence.  The phrase ""guaranteed throughput volume service applies only in the case of a negotiated rate"".  What does this mean?  TK & I were both a littles confused by this language.

	4th paragraph, 4th sentence.  The phrase ""the value of the index based rate bids will be calculated using the applicable published indices available on the bid deadline"".  TK, is the phrase ""published indices"" generic enough or should we use something broader that might encompass basis quotes?  I realize it will probably have to be something that is published.

   Steve -

   I worked it out so you will be getting the lowest possible rate for my
   time, $175/hour (normal rate is $350).  I would like to send you an
   engagement letter this week for up to 3 weeks or 120 hours ($21k).  I
   think
   we can get it done in less time but the 120 hours provides some
   flexibility
   if we decide to go deeper on something -- we would only charge you for
   the
   hours we use.

   I am visualizing the deliverable as an analysis of your restructuring
   options as well as the NPV, Income, and operational effect for each.  To
   the extent time allows, I will be able to help negotiate and close
   whatever
   option you choose.

   In order for me to offer our preferred rate, it is important to note
   that I
   would need to be able to do this project on somewhat of a flexible basis
   (e.g. Friday meetings, emails, and phone vs. being on-site 3 weeks
   full-time).  Even with this flexible structure, I feel confident that we
   can have the deliverable complete by mid December.

   Please let me know if it is ok to draw up an engagement letter with
   these
   terms.

   I have been spending much of my time lately helping merchant power
   generators think about ways to leverage the value of their asset
   position/market intelligence.  It occurred to me that there is an
   analogy
   here that relates to pipelines.

   Pipelines have operational ""events"" that may have  market effects:
       Unplanned outage  (major/minor/duration/notice)
      Planned outages over a certain volume
      Operation flow order/ SOLs
      Key Plants backed in
      Takes over schedule volumes key points
      Linepack levels
      Pressure drops at key points

   Since the pipeline is exposed to gas prices through  gas needed for
   operational purchases - it is rationale that these phenomena would  be
   studied and acted (read traded) upon in order to minimize TW's market
   risk
   (read generate income).  TW can setup a risk management group to execute
   this idea. It is not unusual for a pipeline to  have a risk management
   function -  Duke Pipeline for example has a VP of  Risk Management for
   Pipelines.

   These ""events"" would be studied in the follow way -

   1. Determine whether there is a correlation between  an  ""event"" and gas
   prices/basis differentials. - based on historical  data.
   2.  For those events that have a strong  correlations, develop a trading
   strategy around the relationship.
   3.  Back-test the trading strategy against  historical data - determine
   profitability.
   4.  For operational ""events"" that are  applicable, setup a system to
   execute program trading that is directly linked to  SCADA.


   Secondary benefits of this risk management (trading) strategy, would be
   developing the expertise to make decisions related to benefits of
   selling
   the capacity physical vs. through basis derivatives. (or some
   combination
   of both)

   Steve, if you are interested in this idea I can  start drawing up a
   workplan for this study.

   Steve -

    I have some ideas related to ECS contract restructuring options.  If
   your
   team is available I could come by next Friday mid-morning or later  to
   start discussing  with them.

   On the administrative side, I am working to nail down the lowest hourly
   rate I can get for you.  I would probably propose something like 80
   hours *
   rate, in the engagement letter.  This amount of time should be adequate
   to
   put together a short study on your different options.  I will send you a
   engagement letter this week.  I would just need to get that signed by
   you
   before Friday.

   Also, please let me know if you need any other information on the
   Reliability Centered Maintenance idea, as you prepare to talk to the
   other
   officers.

      Subject:  TW Earnings Idea - Twist on ECS Deals

      Hello Steve -

      Haven't talked to you in a while, hope all is well.  A quick update -
   I
      moved over from EES to Accenture's Energy group about six months ago
   and
      have been focusing on Trading and Risk Management & Pipeline
      Optimization
      projects.

      I had an idea which I thought you might find interesting.  Accenture
   has
      a
      strategic alliance with a technology provider for Reliability
   Centered
      Maintenance (RCM) -- basically an advanced methodology & technology
   for
      making maintenance decisions.  They are the standard for electric T&D
      companies and are now trying to move over into the pipeline segment.
      This
      is how I was thinking about using them to structure a deal:


      1.  TW hires Accenture to implement RCM
      2.  RCM Benefits are determined by a pilot project (4 weeks)
      3.  Accenture pays TW upfront for 10 years of projected benefits from
      RCM
      (say $20MM) as part of our ""guarantee""
      4.  TW pays Accenture an annual licensing fee for the use of RCM over
      the
      next 10 years which will flow into the next rate case.

      I am currently pursuing another project with Ben Asante, so I am
   around
      the
      Enron building.  Let me know if you would like to get together to
      discuss
      further.

      Hope all is well.

"FW: Pricing","TK could you update these prices for me for the Stan Presentation (one more time - it's due to Tracy on Thurs)?

I don't need the historical NYMEX again, unless Vernon has the NYMEX settle price for Jan - Sept '01 (Weren't the historical numbers from last week Inside FERC because we were having a system problem?)

I need them by tomorrow after lunch.  I'm in a meeting from 8:00 to 12:00 tomorrow.  If you have any questions, leave me a voicemail - I'll check it during break.

"SoCal Ideas for Settlement Value","Per our conference call today, here are some ideas to get TW Settlement Value.

1.	SoCal to commit to TW to let us schedule transport at the SoCal/Topock (South Needles) delivery point.

2.	SoCal to turnback 20,000 to 25,000/d of receipt capacity from the WTX Pool, at no cost to TW (SoCal continues to pay for it).

3.	TW has been scheduling PG&E's payback to SoCal at SoCal/Topock to help PG&E and SoCal.  SoCal to schedule this as transport from PG&E/Topock (as a RP) to SoCal/Topock (DP) and pay TW transport fee.

4.	SoCal to agree (in writing) to dedicate to TW the incremental 50,000/d at Needles becoming available Jan, 2002 until Red Rock Expansion in-service.

5.	SoCal to amend their OBA to dollar-valued (from volumetric) and cash-out their existing OBA with TW (at TW's index value).

6.	SoCal to sell storage to TW.

7.	SoCal to purchase incremental Thoreau to West of Thoreau capacity from TW.

8.	Extension of SoCal's mainline &/or San Juan lateral contracts.  Or early notice of termination or early notice of ROFR trigger (so that we would have the opportunity to remarket it).
