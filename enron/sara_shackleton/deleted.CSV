"RE: ECT Investments, Inc. account with Goldman Sachs International","Sara

Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language amending
the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose the
language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

I trust this will now close the open issues.

I look forward to hearing from you

Kind regards

Daniel

Daniel:

Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.  If
you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option and we
can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber of
Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime
brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore, are
not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do have other
business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of limitation
of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from
any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special,
punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage.""

Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of the
office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them executed
together with the terms of business letter.

Regards.  Sara

   Sara

   The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your relationship
   with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues that relate
   to
   the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects with the PB
   relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

   Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately
   addressed
   in the documentation as drafted.

   I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as possible so
   we
   can try to get this wrapped up today.

   Kind regards

   Daniel

   Daniel:

   Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the PB
   conflict
   because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with Par.8
   requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the Terms
   of
   Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts prevail.
   Are
   you agreeing with this analysis?

   Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to conflict
   with
   the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the PB
   (except
   for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It is Enron
   Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit the
   Terms
   of Business in the same manner.

   Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or suggest a
   different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the the
   remaining
   documents.

   Thanks.

      Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke. Arbitration -
   more
      appropriate to general terms of business which principally
   contemplate
      the
      regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the event of
      inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause A3).

      I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

      Daniel:

      Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the ""Agreement"")
      with my colleague Angela Davis.

      I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter
   relating
      to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed but
      were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

      (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par. 14 of
      the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the possible use of
      arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in the
   OSLA)
      so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of the
      Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to English
   courts,
      I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will
      prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

      (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same manner
   as
      Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe that you
      and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why shouldn't
      these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

      I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of the
      account documentation.  Regards.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   2.5%  0.15%  3.75%  4.5%  1.75-2.75%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  USD Slips On Sagging Confidence Ahead Of This Week's Data  October 29, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.89811 $/JPY..122.27 GBP/$..1.4457 $/CHF..1.6385  USD Slips On Sagging Confidence Ahead Of This Week's Data by Jes Black  At 2:00 PM US Sept Fed Budget (exp 27.1 bln, prev  79.9)  Confidence in the dollar started to slip away last Thursday as investors braced for a potentially poor round of economic data this week. It all starts with consumer confidence on Tuesday and ends with the October jobs report on Friday. But USD saw more than a little profit taking in the European session on Monday as traders squared positions ahead of the storm.  EUR/USD rose to a one-week high of 89.92, just lacking the momentum to get it over the 92-cent mark. The other European majors rose in tandem, climbing to respective one-week highs of $1.4479 against the pound and 1.6411 Swiss francs to the dollar. Sterling also benefited from speculation of M&A-related inflows. News that U.S. finance house Babcock & Brown may bid for British rail network operator Railtrack and a weekend newspaper report that German media giant Bertelsmann was eyeing Britain's Carlton Communications added to sterling's appeal, after better than expected GDP data last week. But more surprisingly was the yen's resilience in the face of a further downgrade by the Bank of Japan and their decision to not try and help the economy with more easy monetary policy. USD/JPY fell to a session low of 122.13, but regained key support around 122.25 later in the European session.  Given the past two week's of optimism in the face of weak earnings reports, US economic data this week will give a better clue as to how severe the downturn will be. Most forecasts are expected to show sharp declines and confirm the US edged closer to recession after the September 11 attacks on the United States. Final October releases include the Conference Board's confidence survey, Chicago PMI, NAPM, the Labor report, this week's jobless claims and the key Q3 GDP preliminary report. This will be the most widely watched release because if the Q3 GDP figure proves to be worse than the negative 0.9% expected, it will have a doubly harsh effect on USD as traders also anticipate a larger decline in the October Labor report.   In contrast, half the Eurozone nations will be on holiday this Thursday, which will lead to thin markets and high volatility with the bulk of US data due on Wednesday and Thursday. Therefore, downside risks to USD are enhanced, with only UK and Eurozone PMI data to weigh on the euro and pound this week. Comments from ECB member and Bundesbank president Welteke echoed the ECB's recent assessment by saying the central bank would  cut rates if it could do so without hurting price stability. Welteke also saw Eurozone economic growth significantly below potential at the present and that a return to long term growth of 2.5% will be delayed. But, expansionary effects of this years interest rate cuts are still in pipeline, he said.  Meanwhile, Q3 company earnings reports will continue to play an important role in this week's US stock market and therefore the dollar. So far, over 3/4 of the companies reporting matched or exceeded projected earnings targets, albeit for drastically lower forecasts. A majority of companies are reporting after the bell and given this week's upcoming data, trade is likely to be thin ahead going into Wednesday. Both Dow and Nasdaq futures are in negative territory.  Today's bleak economic and inflation outlook in Japan also failed to spur investors to go long the dollar against the yen. USD  was unable to benefit from the Bank of Japan's decision to keep monetary policy unchanged despite their forecast of a deteriorating economy and rising deflationary concerns. The BoJ's decision to hold interest rates near zero (ZIRP) and maintain a floor of 6 trillion yen in reserves did not impress FX markets.   But inaction was expected and offers to sell USD above 122.50 capped any dollar gains. Dealers say failure to extend gains beyond 123 level indicates that a minor top has been formed around last week's two-month high of 123.35. USD/JPY support seen at 122.30/40, and a break of 122.25/30 opens the way for a breach of the key 122.00 level, from which point most traders based their new long positions and where stop loss orders are likely to be placed. USD/JPY now hovering around 122.30.  The BoJ also offered a sharp downward revision in its own economic growth and price outlooks for fiscal 2001 and 2002, saying the economy was in a ""severe"" adjustment phase. The Bank expects a further fall in exports and output to affect domestic demand in the second half of this fiscal year and not reach a bottom until the second half of FY02/03. After that, the bank expects exports to recover, but sees prices on continued, gradual declining trend in FY01/02, and FY02/03. The BoJ board's full outlook for FY01/02 GDP ranged from -1.6% to -0.6%. FY01/02 CPI ranged from -1.3% to -0.9%. However, the bank's own figures are not seen as making any difference in monetary policy because BoJ Governor Hayami sees structural reform as the key to growth, not more money.  In other news, Finance Minister Shiokawa said the government will still aim for the 30 trillion JGB cap, but should remain flexible to unforeseen changes in economic environment. But worrying markets is what those ""unforeseen changes"" might be. If that includes today's downward revision to growth and inflation, then markets will be very disappointed with the new Koizumi government's promise of reform. Any violation of this key reform is likely to push the yen lower.  Shiokawa also said standards should be set for banks to foreclose on borrowers with excessive debts. ""There are companies that are borrowing from banks that haven't paid any dividends to shareholders for some years, whose debts have been forgiven, but are still unable to recover. Banks should be able to foreclose on such firms,"" he said. ""There should be a set of standards that makes it easier for banks to do so. That would be one way of resolving bad loans."" The Financial Services Agency has been leading efforts to resolve the massive bad loans at banks as part of the government's plans to restructure the country's financial system but so far has made little headway.

EUR/USD fell below 88 cents and USD/JPY rose back above the key 132 level, thus boding well for a resumption of its rally after a weeklong decline stabilized around 131.80 on Tuesday. However, dollar bulls will want to watch tomorrow's meeting between Wasghington and the National Association of Purchasing Managers. Markets have been reluctant bidding USD much higher on the concern that Washington may again waver on the strong dollar policy. Recall, last July when this happened, USD fell because the administration appeared uncertain over the strong dollar policy. However, it is just as important for the US administration let JPY fall in order to keep Japan from falling into a deflationary spiral as many economists fear.  In addition to strong dollar worries, the potential Kmart bankruptcy and the Enron debacle could induce European investors, who have been key purchasers of corporate debt last year, to seek out safer alternatives. That in turn would cause US bound investment flows to falter because of worries over the health of US corporations.  Nevertheless, these fears failed to boost EUR/USD, which fell to a fresh 3-week low of 87.92 in European trade. The sell-off was seen as more technical in nature after falling Tuesday below the key 89.10 level, which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. This level is significant in that it reflects equilibrium in supply and demand conditions between euro and dollar. Moreover, yesterday's close below 88.60 is a bearish sign for the euro and an inability to regain that level will likely call upon further losses. However, EUR/USD would have to break below 87.48, the 31.8% Fib retracement of the same move and channel support. Only a move back above 89.50 would give any hope of a near term recovery. However, moves higher are not seen by the market as indicating strength given the euro's difficulty to remain above 90-cents.   GBP pared earlier gains against EUR, falling to a day's low of 61.64 and added to losses vs US as it fell to a fresh one-week low of 1.4303.  Cable sank to its lowest level against the dollar in over a month on talk of M?related outflows related to Britain's National Grid Group Plc's $3 billion purchase of US power group Niagra Mohawk. However, sterling was able to recover from these losses and regain the $1.4340 support by afternoon London trade. Yet, Failure for GBP to maintain above 1.4440 will bode poorly for cable as it fell from last Monday's 2-week high of 1.4513, a 3-cent drop in 4 days. Resistance is seen at 1.4390, 1.4440, 1.4480, 1.450 and 1.4550.   On the data front, British retail sales showed a surprising 0.3% fall in December, the first monthly fall in sales since April 2000. December's sales volumes were 5.7% higher than a year ago, down from a 7.0% y/y rise in November and a consensus forecast by economists for a 6.9% rise. The ONS said the fall in December sales volumes was ""due to strong November data rather than weak December data."" It added that the underlying picture of retail sales growth remained strong. Therefore, the move did not weigh on sterling which has benefited from strong domestic demand in 2001.   USD/JPY rose to a day's high of 132.30 after a weeklong decline stabilized around 131.80 on Tuesday. The pair is still trading below its 3-year high of 133.37 but dealers remain confident there will be more weakness to come in the JPY.   EUR/JPY also recovered to a day's high of  116.97, but fell bac below support at 116.50 to a day's low of 116.01. Moves in the JPY will be important to watch as most of EUR/USD losses on Tuesday and Wednesday came on the back of a steep fall in EUR/JPY to a low of 115.67 from a high of 119.37 last week, or a 3% drop. That's double the losses incurred by USD/JPY. Resistance is now seen at 116.50 followed by 117.00 and key resistance at 117.50. A close above 116.50 will be needed in order to maintain its bullish momentum, dealers say. Key support is seen at 115.60.  The BoJ on Thursday left its gloomy assessment of Japan's struggling economy intact, repeating the economy continues to deteriorate in January and using the same wording as in its December report.  Tuesday marked the start of earnings season and even though most companies beat poor Q4 expectations, the markets responded more to the general outlook. That was evident on Wednesday after Intel beat Q4 estimates but indicated that it was cutting its cap ex spending more than expected to $5.5 bln from $7.3 bln last year, a 25% reduction. This took the market by surprise and triggered a sharp slide in Nasdaq. That means Wall Street is looking more at the economic outlook than to the previous Q4 2001, which was assumed to be bad.  It also means the overnight sell-off was mostly a reaction to the market getting ahead of itself in early January without the fundamentals to back it up.   Today's important earnings releases include Citigroup, Ford and Sears. Airline companies to report are US, Northwest and Southwest Air. Its also another big day for technology companies with IBM, Microsoft, Nortel all reporting on Thursday.  Today's jobless claims are expected to rise to 426k from last week's 395k due to underfiled claims in California because of a new law. The rise may be offset slightly by the re-opening of auto factories after a winter close and decreased layoffs in the retail sector.  Markets will also look to the Philly Fed survey to show improvement in the overall manufacturing activity in the Philly Fed area. The index is expected to improve to -2% from -12%. Though negative, such an increase would confirm that the economy is indeed turning around.  Also due for release in the US session is housing starts, which are forecasted to decline slightly to 1.6 million from the previous 1.645 mln though holding fairly strong. Housing permits are estimated to edge up to 1.6 million in December from the previous 1.595 mln.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

"Letter from the Chairman to the Membership","								March 7,
2002




Dear NYMEX Member:

On the Proxy Statement and ballot you received for the upcoming Annual
Meeting on March 19, 2002, a proposal has been put forth by the Board of
Directors to amend bylaw section 401 of the NYMEX Exchange relating to the
composition of the Executive Committee.  Currently, that bylaw requires the
Executive Committee to be composed of five members.  Under the proposed
bylaw amendment, the Board of Directors would be given the flexibility to
set the number of members of the Committee.  As is the case today, the
Chairman, Vice Chairman and Treasurer would sit on the Committee.

In the past year, the Exchange has faced a number of challenges, from the
tragic events of September 11 to the growth of competitive platforms.  I am
proud to say that the Board of Directors has risen to the occasion and taken
on these challenges head on with a high sense of involvement with and
commitment to this institution. By giving the Board the ability to set the
size of the Executive Committee, the Board will have the opportunity to
tailor the Executive Committee size to a number which it believes will be
effective in rapidly responding to circumstances at that time.

Depending on the individual Board, this flexibility will enable the Exchange
to capitalize on the level of involvement and specific skills of individual
Board members by engaging the appropriate number of members in the
decision-making process and by ensuring that all segments of the community
are represented.

In addition, from a corporate perspective, the proposed amendment makes
sense.  At the holding company level, the Board of Directors now has the
authority to set the number of members of the Executive Committee.  Approval
of the proposed bylaw amendment would make the Board's authority consistent
at both the holding company and exchange levels and would eliminate the
potential for discrepancies between the parent company and the Exchange.

I strongly urge that you vote in favor of the proposal.  As Chairman of the
Board, I have learned much about the workings of this institution in the
last year and believe that this proposal would enable this organization be
more efficient and effective.  I appreciate your consideration of the
proposal and look forward to working to address your needs in the coming
year.

							Sincerely,

				Vincent Viola
Chairman

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   2.0%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.75-2.75%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Dollar Gives Back Friday's Gains, But Bull Still Stands  November 26, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8817 $/JPY..124.02 GBP/$..1.4177 $/CHF..1.6625  Dollar Gives Back Friday's Gains, But Bull Still Stands by Jes Black  No Key Data Today   The dollar fell further in European trade, giving back all of last Friday's gains after it soared to new 15-week highs against the euro and yen at 87.37 cents and 124.48 respectively, as well as a new 4-month high against the pound sterling at $1.4042. EUR/USD regained key support at 87.50 followed by 88.10 and climbed to a session high of 88.32, stopping just short of last week's highs around 88.35. EUR/USD resistance stands at 88.40 followed by 88.80.  GBP/USD also regained support at 1.4120 and rose to a day's high of 1.4203 before meeting tough resistance around the 1.42 figure.  However, the correction in USD was seen as temporary as today's movement came on the back of a large buy order squeezing dollar shorts in the market. Dealers say there appears to be no demand to chase squeezes or go short USD at these levels, which should mean the dollar is likely to remain strong. Therefore, dealers still see a rally in EUR/USD towards 88.80 to be sold as the bear trend should resume this week targeting 87.20 followed by 86.75.   After earlier action, the FX market appears to have moved into a steady range ahead of the return of US dealers after the long holiday weekend. However there is no major data due today and markets will instead focus on Eurozone and US Q3 GDP figures due on Thursday and Friday as well as the Morgan Stanley Capital International index changes at the end of the week. US Q3 GDP is expected to contract by 0.8% while the Eurozone could grow by 0.1%. Important to the markets this week will be any indications contrary to the prevailing notion of the US economy recovering in the second half of 2002. This prevailing sentiment has been key to the recent rally in US equities and the dollar.  In addition, the Fed's commitment to growth is another reason the dollar has performed so well despite the near certainty of a recession. It is also explains why the Morgan Stanley Capital International index is expected to be reweighed in favor of US equities at the end of this month. According to the adjustments MSCI will make, Japan, France and Germany are likely to see a net outflow of capital, while the UK and US will be on the receiving end.  Markets will also focus on the Federal Reserve's Beige Book on Wednesday because it will give a good indication for the Fed's next interest rate policy meeting on December 11. With parts of the economy showing signs of a turnaround, the probability of further aggressive easing by the Fed has diminished. Markets have priced in only a 30% chance that the Fed will ease by 25 bp next month. Large gains in US equities have helped rein in the Fed's accommodating policy. The S?500 is up over 15% from its September lows, and as investors show an increasing appetite for risk, a huge amount of money sitting on the sidelines is waiting to get a better return than in the money market. The US is likely to remain the preferred destination for international portfolio flows, which should add to the recent momentum in the USD index, which has risen by 5.6% to its highest level since late July at 117.78, and is now less than 3% away from hitting its 15-year high reached in early July.  Meanwhile, JPY came under fresh pressure following the S&P's announcement that it may downgrade Japan's AA+ sovereign debt rating by two notches. USD/JPY rose to 124.35 but could not break key technical resistance around 124.45/50. Markets were not surprised by the news, which was expected, and sentiment was already bearish after the rating agency Fitch downgraded Japan by one notch earlier today. USD/JPY fell below 124 yean to session low of 123.95 after failing to break key technical resistance around 124.45/50. USD/JPY faces resistance 124.50 followed by the Aug 01 high of 125 and 125.25-30. Support is now seen at 124.00 followed by 123.50 with follow-up foundation at 122.75.  In other news, BoJ Governor Hayami said foreign bond buying was not an urgent issue. This could be seen as yen supportive. However, earlier in the day FinMin Shiokawa said he had not heard from the central bank about the possibility of the BoJ purchasing foreign bonds as part of its monetary policy operations. Therefore, his comment suggests that the BoJ acknowledges foreign bond buying is possible which would be yen negative, thus making today's impact on JPY a wash. Recall that JPY came under pressure last week following an article in the FT citing the US administration's acceptance of the BoJ buying US T bills.  GBP/USD also regained support at 1.4120 and rose to a day's high of 1.4203 after plunging to a 4-month low of 1.4042 on Friday. Sterling stumbled following Prime Minister Blair's speech which showed strong enthusiasm for the UK joining European Monetary Union. In the past, any reference has caused a knee jerk reaction. However, given the uncertain time frame and the need for the 5 economic criteria suggested by Treasury Minister Gordon Brown to be met, GBP recovered all of its losses. EUR/GBP also fell to a session low of 62.10.  USD/CHF fell to a session low of 1.6588 but continues to trade in a comfortable range of 1.65 to 1.67 since surging over 5 centimes two week's ago to a high of 1.6753. It will be a key week ahead for the Switzerland, with Q3 employment data due on Tuesday followed by the October KOF indicator on Friday set to show more weakness in business activity. Meanwhile, inflation data for November should show a large decline as oil prices fall worldwide.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

"(02-84) NYBOT Decision to concentrate relocation efforts on One N	orth End Avenue","Notice No. 02-84
March 21, 2002


TO:    		All Exchange Members

FROM:		Vincent Viola, Chairman
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:       	NYBOT Decision to concentrate relocation efforts on One
North End Avenue


The New York Board of Trade has notified its members that last night its
board voted unanimously to drop its pursuit of all other relocation
alternatives and to concentrate all its efforts on coming to a final lease
agreement with our exchange on becoming a tenant at One North End Avenue.
	According to the letter, the main issue that still must be addressed
is NYBOT's ability to obtain a firm commitment for sufficient government aid
to fund the installation of needed technology on the COMEX Division floor.
They believe that solidifying the aid, and drafting the formal lease, could
take one to three months. Their preliminary target for completion of the
necessary work and NYBOT's commencing trading on the COMEX Division floor is
the first quarter of 2003.
	The main terms are for NYBOT to use 13,000 to13,500 square feet of
the COMEX Division trading floor and to lease about 35,000 square feet of
office space in the building. The basic lease is for 10 years, with the
potential for one, and possibly two, five-year extensions.

We welcome this decision by the board of the New York Board of Trade and
applaud their commitment to preserving the role of Lower Manhattan as the
financial capital of the world.  We believe this move will be beneficial to
the members and member firms of both institutions from the standpoint of
creating both efficiencies and additional opportunities.

Both the euro and yen attempted to break through short-term resistance around 89.40 cents and 122.40 yen but failed. GBP/USD also tested overnight highs around 1.4330 following better than expected Q3 GDP data, but traders weren't prepared to bet against the dollar, yet.  Today's final revision in the University of Michigan confidence survey is not expected to have much effect on markets. Forecasts call for a further fall to 82.7 from a preliminary 83.4. This would still be above the final September reading of 81.8. However, the initial reading was for 83.6. Still, the index is down about 10 points from 91.5 in August, putting sentiment at its weakest level since 1993. A lower than forecasted fall would spell trouble for consumer spending, the lifeblood of the struggling US economy. Today's Q3 earnings reports, like on Monday, are not seen moving the market considerably. Both Dow and Nasdaq futures are in negative territory.  On Thursday, the wild one-cent swing in EUR/USD from 88.80 to 89.80 caused some consternation amongst traders who had eagerly shorted the euro following the European Central Bank's decision to keep rates unchanged. The euro's recovery from weak US payroll figures and durable goods orders was not to last though. Wall Street staged a comeback with the Dow climbing 1.25 percent to its strongest finish since September 10. US equities rallied because the prevailing sentiment is still for a strong economic recovery next year. Moreover, much of the negative news is already expected and the dollar could therefore test higher in coming months as long as capital inflows continue.  However, markets may have become overly optimistic about the outlook for the US economy since most economic indicators are still showing weak economic signals. Next week's data from the US is expected to show a preliminary contraction in Q3 GDP of 0.9% along with further falls in manufacturing. This is likely to weigh on the dollar, as it would indicate that the economy is one step away from an actual recession, thereby causing the current optimism to fade. But, even though the euro area is expected to avoid falling into recession next year, it doesn't necessarily mean the euro will rise.   In the near-term, growth concerns will remain in focus, not interest rates. Traders rewarded sterling following today's better than expected Q3 GDP data, sending GBP/USD to a week's high of 1.4337. The economy rose at a 2.2% rate when expectations were for a 2.0% y/y rise. The strong UK growth was a surprise, but markets expect the UK to outperform this year. Therefore, even though growth was above expectations, the Bank of England may choose to lower rates anyway because the MPC is more focused on forward-looking data and the strength of the world economy. Moreover, this week's business confidence data from UK manufacturers plummeted to its lowest in three years in October, which prompted the CBI to call for a 50 bp cut from the Bank of England. Other advocates for more rate cuts include certain members of the Bank of England. MPC officials on the whole remain focused on the external threat to UK growth. GBP/USD trading above 1.43. Support seen at 1.4250, with resistance at in the 1.4330 area.  USD/CHF hovered around support at 1.65 in European trade. Today, Swiss National Bank Vice-Chairman Gehrig said he was happy with current levels of exchange rates and that the  appreciation seen as a consequence of generalized risk aversion after September 11 has been corrected.  But Gehrig did not comment directly on the future direction of Swiss interest rates, only saying the SNB hoped to steer monetary conditions in the coming months in a way that would keep the outlook for price stability intact. On Thursday the government cut its forecast for Swiss growth to 1.6% in 2001 from 1.8% and to 1.3% in 2002 from its original 2.0%.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

The index was down 1.4% from the previous year, the 16 th consecutive month of year on year decline, adding to gloomy economic outlook. January M2+CD money supply rose 3.6% y/y. For the upcoming G7 meeting in Canada this weekend, some analysts think that Japan seems reluctant to weaken the yen significantly, given all the criticism by its Asian neighbors and US manufacturers that the weak yen is undermining their trade competitiveness. In the meantime, markets are also anxious about any monetary policy decision that might be reached at the ongoing Bank of Japan meeting. With deteriorating conditions, the BoJ is under considerable pressure to ease monetary policy to address the nation's economic quagmire. Since interest rates are nearly zero, the central bank may have to resort to increasing its purchases of JGBs from the current level of 800 billion yen to nearly 1 trillion yen in order to inject liquidity in markets and stabilize bond yields. Any such move would likely weaken the yen further, and thus skeptics believe the BoJ may refrain from such a drastic measure because of international pressure at the G7 meeting. PM Koizumi said on Thursday he was willing to continue with reforms despite the plunge in his cabinet's approval ratings.' I believe structural reform is needed to realize sustainable growth of the Japanese economy in the future,'' the PM said. Koizumi also repeated the government's plan to take brave measures to evade a financial crisis.  Support is viewed at 133.40, 133.0 and 132.65. Upside capped at 134.15, 134.40 and 134.80.  US Treasury Secretary O'Neill advocated that all G7 nations must donate to growth to increase living standards. He declared that the worst of the US economic slowdown is over and that there are more signs that a US economic recovery is present. Furthermore, O'Neill urged Japan to implement measures to get its economy on track, but declined to comment on the value of the Japanese yen.  EUR/USD is trading near its day's highs of 87.13 underpinned by ECB President Duisenberg's announcement of his retirement in July 2003, as well as optimism over the Eurozone's economic future. ECB's Duisenberg announced today his decision to step down early for reasons of transparency and to squash speculation, adding that it is a well-known fact that he would not stay for a full-term, but ruled out the possibility of retiring earlier than July 2003. He stressed that there is no connection between his announcement and a succession by serving Vice-President Noyer. German industrial orders rose 5.0% m/m in December from the previous 0.6%, fueling hopes that a recbound is in the works. Traders disregarded the European Central Bank's result this morning to hold rates steady at 3.25% because they are at an suitable level. ECB head Duisenberg commented that monetary developments do not create risks to price stability, but added that a reassessment may be needed if the economy recovers. ECB President Duisenberg once again reiterated that inflation should fall below 2% this year and stay there, though he foresaw inflation would be erratic in early 2002. Moreover, French Finance Minister Fabius confirmed that he lowered France's growth outlook in 2002 to 1.4-1.6% from an initial range of 2.25-2.5%, and projected GDP in 2003 between 2.8-3.2%. Resistance is seen at 87.20, 87.50 and 88.0. Support stands at 86.35, 86.0 and 85.55-- the 71.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.95.  The UK currency shrugged off the Bank of England's unsurprising decision this morning to leave rates unchanged at 4.0% in light of the UK's 2-speed economy characterized by robust consumer and housing spending that is being offset by a contracting manufacturing industry. Resistance is eyed at 1.4165, 1.420 and 1.4235. Support holds at 1.4060, 1.4040 and 1.40.   This week's remaining US indicator is wholesale trade. From the Eurozone, major economic releases consist of German industrial production and Dutch CPI. Highlights from Japan are money supply, wholesale prices and machinery orders. Over the weekend, currency traders will be carefully monitoring any developments at the G7 meeting in Toronto for any mention of the weak yen or strong dollar policies. ECB President Duisenberg indicated that the euro is unlikely to be mentioned in the G7 communique.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Nationwide Core CPI fell 0.9% from a year earlier, 27th consecutive month of decline. Nationwide core CPI fell 0.8% in 2001 compared with the previous year, falling for the 2nd straight year. Overnight the markets were discouraged by Japanese Finance Minister's comments overnight that his policy was not to intervene in forex markets, but to let them decide exchange rates. Traders interpreted his remark as a signal to unload the yen. Finance Minister Shiokawa said yesterday he does not think the yen's decline has been too rapid. Recall, that the yen has lost 2% in just five preceding days. Shiokawa also added that the government plans to   take action'' if the yen moves considerably. PM Koizumi plans to prepare a comprehensive package of tax reforms designed to combat deflationary pressure by spurring demand for real estate and housing. The Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy will focus on raising the gift tax exemption on monetary gifts from parents to children to finance housing purchases and plans to reduce or eliminate various real estate transaction taxes. A joint task force of government officials and the BoJ has agreed to ensure an ample supply of funds on the market and create demand through structural reform, in order to bring deflation under control. The government forecast that the economy which started shrinking 14 months ago, will probably contract 1% in the fiscal year ending March 31, and will likely have 0% this year. Resistance is eyed at 135.0 and 135.50. Support holds at 134.0, 133.60 and 133.0.   Federal Reserve head Greenspan said that the forces restraining the US economy are diminishing and activity is beginning to firm. Greenspan clarified that in his speech on January 11, he had tried to communicate that the economy was stabilizing while avoiding any talk about an economic snap-back, and thus he regretted not phrasing his speech differently. Although Greenspan felt that the US is ""just at this particular point turning"" in the US business cycle, he projected that the US is close to zero GDP growth. On its part, the White House also indicated it saw increasing signs of strength in the economy but also clouds. Therefore, the White House estimated ""quite modest"" GDP growth in Q1, followed by acceleration in growth later.  The euro is trading around 87.74 after falling to from its 1-month low of 87.53, underpinned by European Central Bank Vice-President Noyer's declaration in favor of a strong euro and that the ECB believes the European economy will recover this year. Noyer explained further that the single currency has sufficient room to rise without hurting industry. As for inflation, Noyer reiterated that Eurozone CPI should drop ""clearly below 2%"" after Jan-Feb and stay there. Resistance is viewed at 88.15, 88.60 and 89.10-- the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. Support is seen at 87.50-- the 31.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96, backed by 87.0 and 86.80.  This week's remaining key US indicator is existing home sales. From the Eurozone, major data due for release consist of German PPI, Italian CPI, Italian retail sales and Spanish PPI. The release of consumer prices in Japan is expected to reflect the prolonged deflationary spiral that is adding to their economic woes.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Simon,
I just faxed to you BS reports as of 12/28/01.  It appears total equity is 66,367.44 USD for Enron Credit.  The  metals position is still there.  

The quality of the reports is not good.

Please verify equity you think we should be able to withdraw.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  USD Quiet Ahead of Key Q4 Productivity Data  February 6, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8675 $/JPY..133.41 GBP/$..1.4148 $/CHF..1.6955  USD Quiet Ahead of Key Q4 Productivity Data by Jes Black  At 8:30:00 AM US Q4 Unit Labor costs prel (exp 2.2%, prev 2.3%) US Q4 Productivity prel (exp 2.9%, prev 1.5%)  There was little action in the foreign exchange market on Wednesday ahead of today's key US productivity data for the fourth quarter due at 8:30 AM. Consensus forecasts have been revised higher this week as confidence in the US  productivity miracle  grew. The currenct estimate is for Q4 productivity to rise 2.9% from the 1.5% gain in Q3 of last year.  That is close to the average annual rate of 3.07% per annum from 1995-2002 estimated by White House economists in the Bush administration's first annual Economic Report of the President, released on Wednesday.  The productivity figure is key to the dollar because its strong performance against other currencies is a reflection of higher productivity growth than other industrialized nations. This also explains why the US is a net beneficiary of capital flows as investors believe that productivity growth in the US will be a better investment.  The dollar was little changed against the euro from its US close after a sharp rebound on Tuesday allowed it to recover most of this week's losses. The euro held onto half of Monday's gains after a large rise against the yen helped it back above the psychological 87-cent mark. However, that brief rally soon ran out of steam and EUR/USD is now trading in a range of 86.50 to 86.80.  Failure to regain resistance at 86.80 is seen calling upon support at 86.35 and 86.00, before another attempt at 86.60. Resistance is seen at 87.10, which marks the 38.2% retracement of the .8953-.8560 move. A rise above that level would target the key 87.50 mark and a breach of this level would be bullish for the EUR/USD. However, only a move above past resistance at 88.60 would really damage the bear trend.  The euro was unchanged by data showing unemployment in Germany rose sharply in January, sending the jobless total above 4m. The seasonally unadjusted number of unemployed soared to 4.29m from 3.96m in December, carrying the unemployment rate to 10.4% from 9.6%. German Labor office's Jagoda says economic weakness continues to impact on labor market and as long as weakness persists he cannot rule out a marginal rise in unemployment next month as well. The data is likely to give Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's centre-left government trouble as it is restrained from doing much due to the fiscal restraints of the Masstricht treaty.  Meanwhile, all eyes are on this week's central bank meetings from the Eurozone, UK and Japan. Both the ECB and BoE are expected to hold rates unchanged, but given the resurging pessimism surrounding the Japanese economy, there is a chance the Bank of Japan will take additional easing steps to stop the deflationary trend that menaces the economy.  In order to curb the sharp rise in Japanese Government Bonds, the Bank of Japan might surprise markets and increase the outright purchases of JGBs at Friday's policy meeting. Currently they purchase 800 billion worth of JGBs per month and may decide to increase this by 10-25% to around 1 trillion in an effort to increase liquidity and stabilize bond yields. The move would likely weaken the yen.  However, the yen has found support from Japan's top financial diplomat, Kuroda, who said that rapid foreign exchange movements are undesirable and that he saw no risk of further yen weakness, thereby hinting to dealers that Japan was comfortable with a range of 130-135, for now.  USD/JPY broke below support at 133.60 after failing to break 134.20 earlier. The pair fell to a session low of 133.38. Support is seen at 132.80 and this week's low of 131.90. Resistance is seen at 134.40 and 135.20.  GBP/USD fell to a day's low of 1.4125, near yesterday's support at 1.4115 after peaking at a 1-week high of 1.4247 in European trade on Tuesday. A break below 1.4110 would call upon key support at 1.4180, which marks the 38.2% retracement of the 1.4418-1.4038 move. Follow up support is seen at last week's 6-month lows of 1.4045. Upside capped at 1.4235, 1.4270 and 1.4300.  Sterling was supported by data showing the average value of a UK house has risen above 100,000 GBP for the first time following another strong price increase in January. The rise in home prices is likely to be a boost to consumer confidence and spending in the UK.  The dollar will continue to follow moves on Wall Street after another down day on Tuesday highlighted investors' concerns as the mood again turned to cautious for the US. With the economic rebound already priced into the dollar at last week's highs, Monday's US equity sell-off was all it took to bring about a strong correction in USD from its recent six-month highs against the euro and three-year highs against the yen.  Today's earnings reports will focus on such key companies as Anheuser-Busch, Cisco Systems, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Pepsico.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Weakened By Wall Street Woes, USD Falls on Stop-Loss Orders  February 11, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8779 $/JPY..134.15 GBP/$..1.4220 $/CHF..1.6821  Weakened By Wall Street Woes, USD Falls on Stop-Loss Orders by Jes Black  At 11:00:00 AM US Jan K.C. Fed mfg survey (exp n/f, prev  21)  The dollar added to last week's losses against the European majors but held firm against the yen in London trade on Monday. Dollar losses were seen as mostly technical after a break of key resistance at $1.4180 in GBP/USD triggered stop loss orders to a day's high of 1.4235. That in turn triggered a rise in EUR/USD above key resistance at 87.50 onto a 2-week high of 87.80. However, the gains in sterling and the euro against the dollar are still regarded as an upward correction.  Heavy buying of sterling by European banks drove GBP/USD through an earlier high of 1.4176 rising to key resistance at 1.4235. The reaction high of 1.4247 now needs to be broken in order to wage a move on key resistance at 1.4340, which marks the 61.8% retracement of the 1.4525-1.4038 move. Without a break of that level, the pair remains heavy, dealers say.  Today's producer price data showed a small 0.1% increase in output prices and a 0.6% fall in input prices in January, as expected. But the market will be more interested in tomorrow's RPIX inflation data and Wednesday's Bank of England inflation forecast which should provide clues on interest rate hikes later this year. Stronger than expected inflation would lead to further expectations for the UK to be the first major country to raise interest rates this year as the BoE tries to stem debt fueled consumer spending.  EUR/USD shot to a two-week high of 87.80 on a wave of stop-loss buying after breaking 87.50 with the help of GBP/USD buying. However, the euro still needs to clear 88 cents followed by key resistance at 88.75/80 to remove its bearish outlook. That level marks the 61.8% retracement of this year's high to low of 90.63 to 85.63.   This should prove difficult ahead of tomorrow's meeting of European Union finance ministers in Brussels where Germany is facing censure for allowing its deficit to come close to the 3% of GDP limit. An official warning would not only be embarrassing for Germany but could also highlight the difficulty facing the Eurozone's largest economy caught between the European Central Bank not lowering interest rates and Germany's own brain child   the Growth and Stability Pact.  Therefore, if Wall Street finds its footing today and markets then turn their attention to the growth inhibitive structure of the Euro area, the single currency could come under renewed selling pressure.   The Swiss franc rose in tandem with the euro and sterling against the dollar. USD/CHF fell to a day's low of 1.6820, just pips above Friday's low. With support at 1.6875/80 taken out, the dollar needs to maintain above 1.6820 to avoid further fall to the 1.6685 area.  This level marks the 61.8% retracement of the 1.6350-1.7229 rally, which should hold dealers say. Economic data today showed the Swiss January jobless rate rose to 2.6% from 2.4% in December, as expected.  USD/JPY maintained above 134.00 support but is likely to come under renewed pressure if option barriers rumored to exist around 135 to 136 prove to difficult to overcome. Repatriation concerns are another reason traders should remain weary to short the yen as Japanese corporations bring home overseas assets ahead of the fiscal year end in March. Support is seen at 134.10 and key support at 133.40.  Japanese officials are also likely to try and reign in the yen to a range between 130-135 over the short term as the cost of the weak yen policy has been detrimental to asset prices as it undermines confidence in the ability to hold value. Given the weakened state of Japanese financial institutions amid falling stock prices, the Japanese are now more likely to shun yen weakness in order to restore confidence in the market.  The dollar will likely continue to follow Wall Street with dealers weary of further losses ahead. Last week's dollar weakness reflected 5 consecutive days of decline before Friday's rally. Stocks suffered from the debacle with Enron that had stoked pessimism throughout US markets, leading investors to overlook strong US economic data, such as better-than-expected productivity figures. Therefore, the recent fall in US equities is likely to be contained and the greenback could regain its strength as further signs of a US economic recovery emerge. But if the US has another disappointing day on Wall Street today, the dollar could suffer further setbacks on the basis of flows to the US market slowing due to investor concerns.  There is little in the way of economic data this week until Wednesday. Today's only release is the KC Fed manufacturing survey. in view of the positive the recent upturn in other national manufacturing indicators, the market expects to see similar improvements in the KC area.

         Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
         amending
         the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

         Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose
      the
         language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

         I trust this will now close the open issues.

         Daniel:

         Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding
   issues
         relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate
   policy.
         If
         you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
      and
         we
         can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International
   Chamber
      of
         Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be
   non-prime
         brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and,
   therefore,
         are
         not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do
   have
         other
         business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
         limitation
         of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

         ""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter
   or
      from
         any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect,
      special,
         punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage.""

         Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out
   of
      the
         office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

         All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
         executed
         together with the terms of business letter.

         Regards.  Sara

            The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
         relationship
            with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues
   that
         relate
            to
            the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects
   with
      the
         PB
            relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

            Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are
   adequately
            addressed
            in the documentation as drafted.

            I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as
      possible
         so
            we
            can try to get this wrapped up today.

            Kind regards

            Daniel:

            Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the
   PB
            conflict
            because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with
      Par.8
            requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to
   the
         Terms
            of
            Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts
      prevail.
            Are
            you agreeing with this analysis?

            Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to
      conflict
            with
            the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to
   the
      PB
            (except
            for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It
   is
         Enron
            Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit
      the
            Terms
            of Business in the same manner.

            Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
         suggest a
            different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the
   the

               Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke.
      Arbitration -
            more
               appropriate to general terms of business which principally
            contemplate
               the
               regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the
      event
         of
               inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause
      A3).

               I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

               Kind regards

               Daniel

               Daniel:

               Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
         ""Agreement"")
               with my colleague Angela Davis.

               I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business
   Letter
            relating
               to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we
      discussed
         but
               were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

               (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J,
   Par.
      14
         of
               the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the
   possible
      use
         of
               arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration
   in
      the
            OSLA)
               so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph
   of
         the
               Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to
      English
            courts,
               I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter
   which
      will
               prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

               (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
         manner
            as
               Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe
      that
         you
               and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
         shouldn't
               these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

               I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest
   of
      the
               account documentation.  Regards.

EUR/USD bounced between support and resistance at 87.50 and 87.80 and also held onto overnight gains against the yen, which helped propel the single currency higher on Tuesday. JPY remains weak against the dollar as well, after the Bush / Koizumi meeting left dealers feeling Japan would continue to drag its feet on reforms.  Today's data from Europe had little effect on the FX market as dealers looked ahead to Wall Street for direction. Fears a prolonged stock retreat and a liquidity crunch kept investors away from US assets, which hurts the dollar. Investors also ignored the good news that housing starts rose at the fastest pace in two years by climbing 6.3% in January. This is seen as still giving the dollar underlying strength because of the rising home asset prices are also giving consumers more confidence.   Worries about the US equity market will dominate dollar movements as fears that stricter accounting rules might force some companies to revise down past earnings, and push up P/E values which are already high for recovery periods. This could cause more domestic and international fund managers to shy away from US equities and depress the dollar.  Earnings news today will focus on Allied Capital and Allied Irish Banks, and DaimlerChrysler.   Meanwhile, German GDP fell 0.25% in the last quarter of 2001 the Bundesbank reported today. This put Germany in an official recession after Q301 fell by 0.1%. EUR/USD fell to a day's low of 87.47 after the release, but markets had discounted the news and were instead looking ahead to signs of a possible recovery in the later half of this year. Therefore, as with previous euro rallies, yesterday's one-cent surge was seen as more a reflection of dollar and yen weakness than Eurozone strength.  Yesterday's European data had more of an impact after the rise in Eurozone industrial production to 0.8% in December from the previous month's -0.8% suggested a turnaround in the sector was immanent. The German economic institute ZEW also stated that over half of those surveyed anticipate a Germany economic recovery in the next six months, raising the possibility of a rise in next week's release of the German Ifo business climate index, which would be bullish for the euro.  EUR/USD gains were again capped near overnight resistance at 87.80 and yesterday's surge left dealers perplexed over the dominant trend in the pair. Most see this as a further correction from its bear trend since September. But despite falling towards key support at 86.50/60 on Tuesday, the euro rebounded to a high of 87.79 and is favored for the moment given Japan's economic woes and Wall Street's accounting concerns. While some traders expect a pullback towards 87.00, others see the possibility of a run towards 88.00, 88.60 and 88.80.  Sterling fell to day's low against dollar at $1.4290 following the Bank of England's February 7 Monetary Policy Committee meeting minutes. Dealers unwound more of their cable longs as today's comments corroborated yesterday's remarks from BoE Governor George that expectations of a rate hike were overdone. Trade data also showed a record high deficit of 33.6 billion pounds last year as exports struggled in world markets. Against the euro, the pound bounced off of support at 61.30 pence and rose to a day's high of 61.12 pence.  GBP/USD fell to a day's low of 1.4290, after testing resistance again at yesterday's high of 1.4330, which also marks its 200-day moving average. Like the euro, sterling rebounded against the dollar from an overnight one-week low of 1.4228 but is still below Monday's high of 1.4330 and still yet below key resistance around1.4340/50, the 61.8% retracement of the move from 1.4515-1.4040, which is still providing tough resistance. Without a break of that level, the pair remains heavy, dealers say.  Meanwhile, JPY remained weak across the board, troubled by investor disappointment that Japan did not present tangible evidence that it was proceeding with structural reforms.   USD/JPY rose to a day's high of 133.77 but maintained below yesterday's one-week high of 134.01. USD/JPY rose as traders reacted to Japan's inability to tackle key reforms pledges. Markets grew weary with Japanese rhetoric on Tuesday after listening intently last week to a number of assurances to shore up the financial system and tackle deflation. The market was also disappointed by Japan's shying away on the injection of public funds into the troubled banking sector. USD/JPY support is seen at 132.65 and 132.35. Resistance is seen at 133.70, 134.00 and 135.00.  JPY losses are still seen constrained by repatriation flows back to Japan ahead of the March 31 book closing. Precisely because of troubled banks and indebted companies are forced to shore up their books ahead of the fiscal year end. Afterwards, the yen is likely to come back under pressure as Japan begins to tackle deflation and prevent a financial crisis. But how they plan to do this remains unclear.   Today's data from the US is expected to show a rise in January CPI but nothing that should concern the markets over rate hikes coming soon. More important might be weekly chain store sales which are expected to rise 2.1% after a brief fall the week before. This should carry over to the Redbook retail average to show a 0.9% increase in the first two weeks of February.   	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

"(01-357) On-Going Air Quality Testing","
Notice #   01-357
October 26,  2001
 
TO:                   All Members, Staff and Occupants of One North End  Avenue
 
FROM:             Vincent Viola, Chairman
                          J. Robert Collins, Jr., President
 
SUBJECT:       On-Going  Air Quality Testing
 
 
 
Air Quality Update
 
 
Air quality testing within One North End Avenue has been  and will continue to be the first priority for the management of this  exchange.  The Exchange has engaged  Ambient Group, Inc., an extremely reputable independent laboratory specializing  in this area, to monitor the Exchange's air quality including tests for  transmission electron microscopy (TEM), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons,  Acenaphthene, Acenaphthylene, Anthracene, Benz (a) anthracene, Benzo (a) pyrene,  Benzo (b) fluorathene, Benzo (ghi) perylene, Benzo (k) fluoranthene, Chrysene,  Dibenz (a,h) anthracene, Fluoranthene, Flourene, Indeno (1,2,3 cd) pyrene,  Napthalene, Phenanthrene, Pyrene, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead,  Manganese, Nickel, Silica, and Zinc.   Air quality tests were performed on September 14th, 20  th, 26 th, October 4 th, 9 th, 12  th, 16 th, 18 th, 23 rd, and  26th, and, to date, all results have been well below the EPA, OSHA,  ASHREA, and ACGIH levels.
 
The Exchange has also taken a pro-active approach on  testing for dangerous chemicals outside the building, as a result of the tragic  events that have occurred in the past six weeks.  Ambient Group, Inc. has secured a  high-volume air sampling monitor (one of only four available to commercial  buildings in New York City) that tests for Benzene, Dioxin, P.C.B.s, as well a  large variety of other air borne chemicals and is based on EPA guidelines.  The Exchange has been testing for these  chemicals for the past few weeks and the first results will be available by next  week.  
 
Going forward, all test results will be posted and made  available to all building occupants on a weekly  basis.
 
Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to  contact Elliot Zuckerman, property manager, at (212)  299-2242.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

[IMAGE] Forums Discuss these points in the Forums:  Forexnews Forum       Technicals Live Charts Analysis available from: Cornelius Luca   J.P. Chorek   Technical Research Ltd.   Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   2.0%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.75-2.75%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  November 18, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8842 $/JPY..122.88 GBP/$..1.4273 $/CHF..1.6574  Japanese Forex Trading Preview by Darko Pavlovic  No key data.   The dollar is near a three week high vs. the yen, trading around 122.85 and could break key resistance level of 123 on hopes about the war in Afghanistan and recovery of the US economy and further cases of deterioration in Japanese economy. The yen was weighted by the news of five Japanese banks that filed for bankruptcy, as well as pessimism surrounding the structural reforms. Even though the government approved a 3 trillion yen extra budget, many detractors believe it is insufficient to redress the nation's economic woes and may necessitate a second extra budget that would drive spending above the official caps. News of the acquisition of Lucent's fiber-optics division by Japan's Furukawa Electric Co. for $2.3 billion is likely weighing on the yen as well, since the president of the firm announced Furukuawa would finance the purchase with $1.06 billion from cash reserves and take out a bank loan of $1 billion. Last week, the Bank of Japan decided in a unanimous vote to keep monetary policy unchanged by leaving its liquidity target above 6 trillion yen. Upside capped at 123.0, 123.30 and 123.65. Support stands at 122.50, 122.30 and 122.0.  The euro is trading around $0.8840 maintaining a firm tone vs. the greenback after Friday's data showed the largest decline in US industrial production since November 1990, and German Chancellor Schroeder survived parliamentary non-confidence vote. The dollar was supported from further falling vs. the euro on news that top Bin Laden deputy Mohammed Atef was killed in the US bombing campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan. French Finance Minister Fabius stressed that Europe's economy is basically sound and they are attempting to promote growth. Fabius deplored the IMF world economy forecasts as being ""too pessimistic"" and denied that it is ""not true that there is recession everywhere"". Traders anticipate next Wednesday's release of Germany's Ifo business climate index (an estimate of German growth, which accounts for about one-third of the Eurozone) to verify if it will recover slightly in November to 86 after plunging to 85 in October from 89.5. Markets also await Eurozone industrial production figures for September, which likely dropped since French and Italian outputs declined. Disappointing results will most likely spark renewed selling in the euro. Resistance is viewed at 89.0, 89.30 and 89.50. Support is seen at the 88.0-cent figure, backed by 87.70 and 87.40.  This week the key US indicators consist of housing starts and permits, international trade, the index of leading indicators, jobless claims and the University of Michigan Confidence survey. From the Eurozone, economic highlights include Euroarea industrial production, French current account balance, Italian CPI, German CPI, German Ifo business climate index, German GDP, German PPI, German import prices, French GDP, and Italy's ISAE business confidence survey. Japanese data due for release are the trade balance, the index of tertiary sector activity and the BoJ Corporate Service Survey. Economic data from the UK comprise the trade balance and the minutes from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee Meeting on Nov.8-9.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

The dollar is trading near its one-week highs vs. the yen, around 135, as the markets expressed their pessimism about Japanese economic outlook and concern that the government and the BoJ are behind the curve in boosting the growth. The BoJ left interest rates unchanged last week and did not announce any new measure to fight inflation and boost the growth. Even the government was hoping that the central bank would decide to raise purchases of JGBs or take other measures to pump more liquidity into the system. The Nihon Keizai reported that the government could inject more than10 trln yen until September, but with request that the central bank further ease monetary policy. Economic Minister Takenaka said that the plan could also deal with the launch of government fund to buy shares that banks hold in other companies. Finance Minister Shiokawa said Friday that he wants MoF to provide around 2 trln yen to buy stocks from banks and asked the central bank to raise monthly bond purchases to 1 trln yen. At G-7 meeting BoJ Governor Hayami said the central bank will support PM Koizumi's reforms  as much as possible . Support is viewed at 133.40, 133.0 and 132.65. Resistance is seen at 135.15 and 135.50.    At G7 Finance Minister's Meeting held this weekend in Ottawa, Canada, ministers showed enthusiasm about the US growth and said the economic outlook has improved since their last meeting. The G-7 did not talk about the weak yen and markets could be prompt to believe that fin ministers are comfortable with the current yen's level, which could bring the Japanese currency to new lows. Japanese officials talked about the steps necessary to get the country out of recession and their US counterpart O'Neill said ministers  were satisfied  with explanation. G 7 Ministers also refrained from promising any financial help to Argentina.   EUR/USD is trading around 87 cents after rising on Friday to a 2-week highs of 87.53 boosted by rise in German industrial production to 1.9% m/m from the previous -0.8%, or on an annual basis to -1.8% from the previous -4.8%, that foretells of a pickup in growth. Markets had been expecting a modest gain to 0.1%. EUR/USD ended down roughly 10 pips from its opening level, as the dollar benefited from a late-day rally in US equities. Upside capped at 87.50, 88.0 and 88.50. Support holds at 87.0, 86.65 and 86.40.   Looking forward to this week, major US economic releases include retail sales, jobless claims, business inventories, import prices, PPI, industrial production and the University of Michigan confidence survey. Key Eurozone indicators consist of Spain's labor force survey, Euroarea EcoFin meeting, German foreign trade, Spanish retail sales, ECB monthly bulletin, Dutch GDP, French employment, French trade balance, French industrial production and Italian industrial production. Highlights from Japan comprise the balance of payments, Cabinet Office economy watchers survey and GDP. Markets will be closed in Japan on Monday in observance of National Foundation Day.

As repatriation continues ahead of March 31, the end of fiscal year in Japan, the yen continues to show resilience vs. the dollar, hovering around 128 levels, despite verbal intervention from officials to step in the forex market to stem the currency's strength and continued dismal economic data. Beside repatriation Japanese currency got support from another rally in the Nikkei-225 Index, which closed at 11919, its highest level in 7 months.  The index is now up 13% on the year thanks to government regulation to boost domestic equities. These measures include encouraging companies to buy back their stocks and enforcing rules against short-selling, whereby brokers cannot short stocks (sell them with the intention of buying them back at a lower price) when the last price move was a down move (downtick). Credit rating agency Moody's made placed a temporary damper on yen sentiment, when it downgraded the insurance strength ratings of 8 Japanese life insurers to a negative outlook. Moody's stated a weakening economy, grim outlook for a quick recovery and uncertain prospects for additional external support as the rationale for its action. Markets will eye announcement from  the government of asset allocation plans from a pension plan which could sign a rise in foreign bond investment.  Japanese banks turned net sellers of Japanese government bonds for the first time in five years in 2001 due to stock market decline and the introduction of fair value accounting standards. Analysts estimate that if the tendency continues long-term interest rates could express upward pressures, putting a further haul on the economy. January core machinery orders fell to15.6% from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis, the biggest drop in 15 years due to lower orders from both manufacturers and non-manufacturers. The diffusion index of the Economy Watchers Survey, which measures the opinions of people concerning the present state of the Japanese economy weigh against with three months earlier, rose 1.2 points from January to 33.1.It is possible that  Japanese officials will step up their interventionist rhetoric near the 126 level so as to build a floor at the psychologically and technically important level of 125. Technically, 125.45 is the 50% retracement of the drop from this year's high of 135.15 to the September low of 115.75. 125.10 follows at the-200 day moving average.  Resistance starts at 129.50 followed by major pressure point at 130.65.  EUR/USD is trading around 87.55 after German based IWH Institute today raised Germany's 2002 growth forecast to 0.8% from 0.6%.  The Eurozone Q4 GDP numbers will finally be released tomorrow at 5 AM, expected to show a 0.7% decline from a 0.5% increase in Q3. This would translate into an annual growth of 1.5% for 2001, compared to 1.2% in the US.  At 2 AM, German inflation figures for February are expected to show a 1.9% rise y/y from 2.3% in January. Yet, it's unlikely that the figures will prompt much change in the shrinking range of the EUR/USD. Initial support seen at 87.25 backed by 87.00 and 86.75-70. 86.20-25 is the next major support, which lies on the trend line support line extending from the 83.50 low thru the 85.63 low. Initial upside capped at 87.60 followed by substantial pressure at 88.10--the 50% retracement of the 90.63 high thru the 85.63 low. Next major resistance seen at the 200-day MA of 88.50 followed by 88.70-80 which is presented by (i) the 61.8% retracement of the aforementioned move and (ii) the trendline resistance which extends from the 93.35 high thru the 90.63 high.  Oil prices stabilized after nearing last week's 6-month highs earlier today, following heightened fears of US military attack against Iraq.  A statement from Iraq today saying UN weapon inspectors would not be allowed to return fuelled tensions and fears of a US attack to force compliance. Meanwhile, OPEC said it would extend its supply cuts into June and would explore the possibility of keeping the output curbs in the second half of the year. April Brent crude oil rose as high as $23.64 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate touched $24.40 per barrel.   This week, markets should expect further good news from the US as they witness the release of the Feb retail sales report on Wednesday and the Feb industrial production figures on Friday. Retail sales are expected to have jumped by 0.9% after a 0.2% decline in January while industrial production is expected to post its first increase since rising 0.2% in September 2000. Another reason to upward revisions to US growth forecasts in the first half of 2002 is last week's signing of the fiscal stimulus in Congress. Both parties finally agreed to launch a $51 billion package, which includes the extension of jobless benefits to an additional 13 weeks (worth $8.5 billion), thereby extending relief to most workers whose 6-month jobless insurance will expire this month after having lost their jobs after the September 11 attacks. The package also includes corporate tax breaks of as much as 30% for companies with large capital budgets. The bill is expected to boost corporate profits and lift GDP growth by about 0.5%.

"(01-391) Emergency Rules - ScotiaMocatta Warrants","Notice Number: 01-391
November 21, 2001

TO:
ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:
Emergency Rules - ScotiaMocatta Warrants


As a result of the attack on the World Trade Center and the inaccessibility
of the precious metals stored at ScotiaMocatta Depository (""SMD""), an
Exchange Licensed Depository, located in Four World Trade Center (""4WTC""),
the NYMEX Board of Directors implemented emergency rules pertaining to the
warrants issued by SMD.  In summary, these emergency rules permitted an
individual or firm taking delivery the option to reject a warrant for metal
on deposit at the SMD vault at 4WTC.

SMD has successfully relocated, using an Exchange Approved Carrier, all of
the precious metals stored at 4WTC to an SMD custodial account at the
Brink's Inc Exchange Licensed Depository and has applied to the Exchange to
establish a new Licensed Depository in New York City.

Therefore, the Exchange has, effectively immediately, rescinded the
emergency rules pertaining to the warrants issued by SMD.  As a result, the
Exchange Rules relating to warrants are those which were in effect prior to
the declaration of the emergency.

Prior to the establishment of its new facility as an Exchange-licensed
depository, SMD will offer its clients the options of leaving the metal in
storage; selling it to SMD; exchanging depository receipts for those of
another Exchange-licensed depository acceptable to ScotiaMocatta, with any
ounce differential cash-settled on the basis of a published price determined
by SMD; or delivering replacement metal to a mutually agreeable location, in
exchange for the metal at the ScotiaMocatta depository, subject to payment
by the client of the current price differential, as quoted by SMD.

Should you have any questions please contact Thomas LaSala at 212-299-2897,
Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608 or Nick Galati at 212-299-2920.

"Follow-up to today's E-mail","Dear Shareholder:

As a follow up to today's email to stockholders, I want to provide you with
the underlying assumptions used to produce the annual rates of return
contained in the graph.
The annual rate of return is calculated by comparing the (i) annual
appreciation of a seat and (ii) the lease revenue (based upon the cumulative
monthly average for a 6-month lease) generated for a calendar year with
(iii) the purchase price at the beginning of a calendar year. For instance,
if you bought a seat at the last seat price in 1999 ($690,000) and leased it
at the average lease rate over the course of a year, the amount of revenue
you would receive, taking annual appreciation into account, would provide a
20% annual rate of return as of the last day of 2000.

Sincerely,
J. Robert Collins, Jr.

Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language amending
the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose the
language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

I trust this will now close the open issues.

I look forward to hearing from you

Kind regards

Daniel

Daniel:

Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.  If
you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option and we
can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber of
Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime
brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore, are
not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do have other
business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of limitation
of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from
any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special,
punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage.""

Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of the
office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them executed
together with the terms of business letter.

Regards.  Sara

   The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your relationship
   with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues that relate
   to
   the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects with the PB
   relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

   Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately
   addressed
   in the documentation as drafted.

   I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as possible so
   we
   can try to get this wrapped up today.

   Kind regards

   Daniel

   Daniel:

   Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the PB
   conflict
   because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with Par.8
   requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the Terms
   of
   Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts prevail.
   Are
   you agreeing with this analysis?

   Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to conflict
   with
   the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the PB
   (except
   for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It is Enron
   Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit the
   Terms
   of Business in the same manner.

   Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or suggest a
   different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the the
   remaining
   documents.

   Thanks.

      Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke. Arbitration -
   more
      appropriate to general terms of business which principally
   contemplate
      the
      regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the event of
      inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause A3).

      I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

      Daniel:

      Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the ""Agreement"")
      with my colleague Angela Davis.

      I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter
   relating
      to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed but
      were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

      (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par. 14 of
      the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the possible use of
      arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in the
   OSLA)
      so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of the
      Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to English
   courts,
      I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will
      prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

      (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same manner
   as
      Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe that you
      and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why shouldn't
      these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

      I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of the
      account documentation.  Regards.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   2.0%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.75-2.75%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  November 26, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8805 $/JPY..124.04 GBP/$..1.4125 $/CHF..1.6636  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  by Darko Pavlovic  No key data.   The dollar fell against the euro after posting three week of profits, undermined on announcement from National Board of Economic Research that the US has been in a recession since March of this year for the first time in a decade. The NBER official noted the US economic slowdown was exacerbated by the September 11 attacks, but anticipates a recovery by July 2002 due to extrapolation of historical data The statement from ECB's Quaden that Eurozone growth is close to stagnation also boosted the single currency. ECB member and Belgian Central Bank head Guy Quaden reiterated his stance that inflation is low and will continue to decline. Markets expect a further fall in the euro after Thursday's release of Euroarea GDP that will likely show flat growth of 0.1% in Q3, particularly after German Finance Minister advisers commented that German growth had slowed to a standstill. In addition, the euro is likely to be weighed this week by the changes in the MSCI indices that will spur outflows from European stocks by global portfolio managers. Furthermore, forecasted declines in both Italian consumer and French business confidence and a rise in French unemployment will exert more downward pressure on the single currency this week. Resistance is seen at 88.35, 88.60 and 89.10. Support is eyed at 87.60, 87.20 and 87.0- the key support determined by the downward channel between the 87.71 low on November 14 and the 87.35 low on November 23.   The dollar is holding around 124 yen, after ratings agency Standard & Poor's announced it was considering downgrading Japan's AA+ sovereign debt by two notches, following Fitch's downgrade of Japanese government debt. Finance Minister Shiokawa said he had no indication from the Bank of Japan that they would buy foreign bonds as part of its monetary policy operations in response to an article last week in the Financial Times that the US would be tolerant of the BoJ's buying US bonds. Japan's 13 major banks are likely accumulate 6.26 trln yen in losses from bad-loan disposal for the fiscal year ending March 2002, more than three times as much as projected in May, according to earnings reports released through Monday. Prime Minister Koizumi asked Finance Minister Masajuro Shiokawa on Monday to re-examine his decision to delay the April 2002 start of a combined tax-filing system for corporate groups. ""I would like you to reconsider it because business leaders are seeking early implementation,"" Koizumi told Shiokawa at a meeting of the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that pubic support for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party remains at strong 49%, down two percentage points from two months ago. The Nov. 23-25 survey from Nihon Shimbun showed that 78% of respondents support Koizumi, down one percentage point from September, and 14% do not support him, two points more than two months ago.A report by the Japan Research Institute showed that Japan's current account and trade surplus could shrink to zero as early as 2004 due to the transfer of production overseas and increased imports from Asia Upside capped at 124.50, 125.0 and 125.30. Support is seen at 123.80, 123.50 and 123.20  This week's remaining key US indicators include existing and new home sales, jobless claims, durable goods, real GDP and the Chicago Purchasing Managers survey. Fed Governor Meyer and St. Louis Fed President Poole will speak tomorrow, followed by Chicago Fed President Moskow on Wednesday. From the Eurozone, economic highlights consist of the ISAE Consumer Confidence survey, Italian retail sales, Euroarea M3, Euroarea GDP, France's INSEE industry survey, Italian CPI, Euroarea HICP, French unemployment rate, French PPI, Italian PPI and Spanish PPI. The main piece of data due for release from the UK will be the Gfk Consumer Confidence survey. Major Japanese indicators comprise industrial production, labor force survey, household survey of expenditures, consumer prices and housing starts.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

"Power Outage at Enron Building","
Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

The dollar is trading around 133.40 yen ahead of Monday's Tokyo trading, as Japanese currency remain supported by repatriation flows before the end of the fiscal year on March 31. They yen was boosted last week after unemployment rate fell to 5.3% in January from the previous revised 5.5%. In particular, the Japanese currency was boosted as traders covered their short positions ahead of regulatory changes about the short-selling of equities that sent the Nikkei surging over 2% or 224 points to a 2-month high of 10812. Japanese Economics Minister Takenaka said on Friday that it may be necessary to consider taking more steps to further stabilize Japan's financial system before the end of the fiscal year. However, he did not commit to the injecting of public funds into major commercial banks to help them deal with the massive bad loans on their books, which is considered a prerequisite for Japan to proceede with reforms. The BoJ announced that the nation's monetary base rose by 27.5% in February from a year earlier, the highest increase since August 1974, the sixth consecutive month of double digit growth.   The FSA plans to have banks issue stock that would grant the government voting rights on matters related to the appointments and dismissals of board directors if they will have to receive public funds to avert a financial crisis, agency sources said Saturday.Support is seen at 133.0, 132.50- the support lying on the trend line extending between the lows January 9 through February 15, followed by 132.20. Upside capped at 134.0, 134.40 and 134.80.  EUR/USD is trading around 86.50 underpinned last Friday's release of Eurozone PMI that rose to 48.6 in February from the previous revised 46.3, the highest level in the index in 10 months, and suggests that an economic recovery is in the works. However, the single currency's gains were limited by Eurozone retail sales which slid to -0.6% m/m in December from the previous 1.2%, or to 0.4% y/y from the previous 1.3%, as well as a decline in French consumer confidence to -15 from -12 in a reversal of four straight monthly gains. Thus in the face of mixed signals of economic improvement and restrained by inflationary pressures, the European Central Bank is seen as unlikely to cut rates when it meets next Thursday. Support is viewed at 86.30, backed by the 86.0-cent figure, and 85.50. Resistance is seen at 87.0, 87.40 and 87.80. The ECB and BoE are likely to keep interest rates unchanged at this week's policy meeting. The ECB, will probably leave benchmark lending rate at 3.25% and the U.K. central bank will maintain its key lending rate at 4%o 1.75 percent from 6.5 percent.   Looking ahead, major data due from the US consist of the non-manufacturing ISM PMI, factory orders, productivity, consumer credit, and the labor market report. Key Eurozone indicators include the Euroarea business and consumer confidence survey, Euroarea PPI, German import prices, Euroarea Services PMI, Euroarea unemployment, German Services PMI, French Services PMI, Italian Services PMI, Spanish industrial production, German manufacturing orders, German unemployment, ECB rate decision, Italian GDP and Dutch CPI. Highlights from Japan comprise the employment survey, MoF corporate survey, indices of business conditions, GDP, money supply and wholesale prices.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  January 31, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8578 $/JPY..134.90 GBP/$..1.4093 $/CHF..1.7207  Japanese Forex Trading Preview by Darko Pavlovic  No key data.   The dollar is trading off its fresh 3-years high of 135.14  yen on combination of possibility of S?downgrade; fall in PM Koizumi's popularity and markets optimism about the US recovery. Standard & Poor's rating agency said Japan faces the risk of a third rating downgrade in a year because its economy has fallen into a   worrisome'' deflationary recession. "" Furthermore, overnight comments by MoF Mizoguchi did little to stem the bearish sentiment towards the yen, since he said that while Japan was not driving the yen down, it was still correcting from excessive strength. Japanese network Tokyo Channel 12 showed Prime Minister Koizumi's popularity fell to 34.7% after he fired Foreign Minister Tanaka compared with a 64.4% rating two weeks earlier. Markets were uneasy about Koizumi's political decision, since it could impede the implementation of structural reforms. US Secretary of Treasury O'Neill said that he had no sympathy for US manufacturers who are complaining about the strong dollar and expressed his hope about the economic recovery. At the current World Economic Forum in New York, Fuji Xerox's Chairman and CEO Yotaro Kobayashi said today that it would be acceptable for the yen to weaken to 140 per dollar, but a fall below that to 150-160 per dollar would create trouble since ""it may have a major negative impact on interest rates and on our trade relationship with the United State or other countries"" Kobayashi also pointed out that the falling yen would ameliorate Japan's deflationary spiral, but warned that too steep a plunge would push up real interest rates that would hinder Japan from clawing back out of its fourth recession in the past ten years. Foreign investors were net sellers of Japanese equities for a second week in the five days ended Jan. 25. Nikkei fell below 10,000 yesterday for the first time since Oct. 10 as Japanese stocks remain lethargic, reflecting the poor outlook of Japanese economy.  Japan has been pressured by other Asian nations, such as China and South Korea, to stem the yen's decline as it makes their exports less competitive. Japan December housing starts fell 12.9% from a year-earlier to 95,431 units, due to weakening consumer desire for mortgages as unemployment continues to rise. Resistance is seen at 135.25, 135.80 and 136. Support holds at 134.50, 134, and 133.70.   The euro fell two-third cents to a 3-session low of 85.79 against the triumphant dollar, dragged by the rise in German CPI to 0.9% m/m in January from the previous 0.1% and upbeat market sentiment about the US recovery. Preliminary data from several German states indicated that the upswing in prices resulted primarily from rising food prices and increases in taxes rather than euro cash related markups. Since German prices exceeded forecasts and because they tend to be be indicative of an overall rise in Eurozone inflation in January, analysts believe the European Central Bank is unlikely to lower interest rates when it next meets to determine monetary policy on February 7. This was evident in ECB Wellink's statement that there is no need for monetary policy action to counter the effect of the euro on prices. Support is seen at 85.55-- the 71.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.95, backed by 85.0. Upside capped at 86.60, 87.0 and 87.50.  The first piece of data markets will look at Friday is the January US labor market report. Although the unemployment rate is forecasted to creep higher to 5.9% in January from the previous 5.8%, non-farm payrolls are seen to improve to between  27k and  50k from  124k in December. The apparent contradiction between the aforementioned variables is explained by the unrelenting climb in continued claims to 3,382,000 in the week of January 19 from the previous revised 3,361,000, whereas the US 4-week average fell to its lowest level since August 2001 to 386k in the week of January 26 from the previous revised 401,250. The greenback overlooked this week's rise in US jobless claims to 390k from the previous revised 360k, since it came in below the 400k-level. Following tomorrow morning's labor report, the dollar is likely to find support from the release of the ISM (formerly NAPM) Purchasing Managers Index as it looks poised to jump to 49.4 in January from the previous 48.2, possibly even breaching the key 50-level. Various components of the index, including production, new orders and employment, are forecasted to exhibit a similar expansion. The University of Michigan confidence survey is not anticipated to generate waves in FX markets, as forecasts call for the final January reading to remain virtually unchanged at 94.3. Meanwhile, traders will also be monitoring this week's World Economic Forum in New York and next week's G7 meeting in Toronto for any dollar policy rhetoric in light of the recent complaints about the strong dollar by manufacturers.

Many analysts interpreted the US endorsed a weak yen after the Treasury Secretary O'Neill's comments overnight that markets should determine currency exchange rates. Nonetheless, O'Neill emphasized that manipulating FX rates would not solve Japan's economic difficulties. In addition, O'Neill reaffirmed that the US was committed to its ""strong dollar"" policy, although the US is only likely to support weakness in the yen in hand with the writing-off of bad loans, acceleration of structural reforms and market deregulation. O'Neill will have a chance to further expand his views on Japan's economy and forex levels after he meet with the BoJ Governor Hayami who is a vocal opponent of weak yen policy. US Treasury Secretary will give a press conference around 1 AM EST. PM Koizumi said that Japan's banks are not in need a new round of public fund injections at the moment, but the government is wary if it becomes necessary.  If, in the future, there is a risk that great harm will fall upon the financial system, we will take flexible measures,"" Koizumi said. Finance Minister Shiokawa said to his US counterpart that the Japanese government will urge the BoJ to provide more liquidity to the market as part of efforts to overcome deflation. During a 40-minute meeting with O'Neill, Shiokawa stressed the Japanese government's determination to bring deflation under control. According to BoJ branch managers for Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo and Fukuoka corporate sentiment is worsening further and production continues to decline. Some branch managers warned of the growing divide among companies in areas such as corporate earnings. Japanese Nov all industries activity rose 0.4% from the previous month. The tertiary sector index rose 1.7% in November from the previous month. Support is seen at 133.60, backed by 133.0 and 132.60. Upside capped at 135.0 and 135.50  EUR/USD is trading around 88.80 as the EUR/JPY rose to a session high of 118.70 after more bad data from Japan confirmed the weakness in the second largest economy. The euro was upon the release of the largest rise in the US Index of Leading indicators in 6 years. In spite of the greenback's initial strong performance, the euro and Swiss franc had recovered by the end of US trading, while the pound and yen stemmed their losses as falling stocks weighed on the dollar. Also giving the single currency a boost was ECB Welteke's conviction that Eurozone inflation will fall below 2% in spring. However, Welteke foresaw a possible rise in January Eurozone prices, though the inflation downtrend is intact. In spite of his slight pessimism, many market players were cheered by the possibility that the European Central Bank will lower rates once inflation breaks below the bank's 2% target. Resistance is seen at 89.10-- the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the same move, and 89.55. Support is viewed at 88.10, 87.70 and 87.50-- the 31.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96.   The major event of this week will be Fed Chairman Greenspan's testimony before the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday since markets are anxious to hear his remarks on the economy and any clues they might glean about the central bank's monetary policy. In particular, economists believe that Greenspan's testimony may also be supportive to the dollar following a report in the Washington post that according to Fed sources, Greenspan ""sounded more pessimistic than intended about the prospects for U.S. economic recovery"" in his January 11 speech. This was confirmed today by Dallas Fed President McTeer who said that Greenspan's speech on January 11 was not quite as negative as some thought. McTeer also pointed out that the US economy is looking much better than it was 2 months ago. According to the sources, the Fed Chairman is likely to comment more positively about the current state of the US economy on Thursday, and therefore markets are now pricing in less than a 30% chance of a rate cut at the Jan 30 meeting, leaving the majority to believe rates will be held steady at a 40-year low of 1.75%.  This week's key US indicators include jobless claims and existing home sales. Fed Chairman Greenspan's testimony before the Senate Budget Committee will be the major event of the week, with markets cautious to hear his remarks on the economy. From the Eurozone, major data due for release consist of Euroarea labor costs, German CPI, Italy's ISAE consumer confidence survey, ECB monthly bulletin, German PPI, Italian CPI, Italy's ISAE industrial confidence survey, Italian retail sales and Spanish PPI. Economic highlights from Japan comprise the trade balance, index of tertiary sector activity, corporate service prices and consumer prices.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

Fed Survey (exp 12.9, prev  14.7)  The dollar edged higher against the European majors and held its gains against the yen this morning. However, dealers expressed nervousness about going long the dollar after two tumultuous days on Wall Street that whipsawed the greenback back and forth. Wednesday's recovery in US equities helped the dollar regain investor confidence.   But key data from the US today could undermine any further dollar gains.   EUR/USD fell to a 2-day low of to 86.84, but failed to target support at 86.60/50. Dealers warn that action is becoming increasingly volatile and directionless, but gains and losses are seen tracking Wall Street carefully. Therefore, most dealers see the recent EUR/USD rebound as a further correction from its bear trend since September. This reflects the view that US equity losses are also a temporary phenomenon. But despite  Enronitis  gripping the market for over a month now, it remains the main story on the Street.   Therefore, EUR/USD could stage another recovery given Japan's economic woes and Wall Street's accounting concerns. While some traders expect a pullback towards 86.50, others see the possibility of a run towards 87.50 88.00, 88.60 and even 88.80. But if the pair was to fail breaking the last resistance zone, it could resume its downtrend from there.   The dollar rose to a day's high of 134.04 yen today while EUR/USD languished around a low of 116.07 until rebounding to a day's high of 116.74 and carrying EUR/USD back above 87-cents. So, also watch the EUR/JPY cross for its divergence from USD/JPY (since USD/JPY gains are seen capped at 135) where a move higher could boost EUR/USD.  Weighing on the euro today was a surprise 0.4% fall in French consumer spending in January which sent the yearly rate to 1.2% from 3.8% and pushed the euro to a day's low of 86.84. Meanwhile, mixed data from Italy had little effect on the market. Italy's December industrial sales rose 0.3% m/m, but fell an unadjusted 6.8% y/y in 2001. Industrial orders also fell 3.5% y/y. Italian cities reported preliminary consumer price inflation data for February up 2.5% y/y from 2.4%.  Data from the UK also dragged GBP/USD below yesterday's low of 1.4261 after back to back surprise declines in UK retail sales worried dealers. Retail sales fell for the second month in January, down 0.3% m/m to bring the yearly rate down to 4.2%. GBP/USD fell  to a day's low of 1.4237, just above key support at 1.4235. Dealers realized this was the first time retail sales had fallen two consecutive months since 1998. The drop left some wondering if sales which peaked at 7% annually in November are now going to level off as the Bank of England had hoped. This would put off future interest rate hikes and weigh on the pound. Support stands at 1.4225, 1.420 and 1.4150. Upside capped at 1.4340, 1.4365 and 1.440.  EUR/GBP also rose on sterling weakness to a day's high of 61.17. But, the EMU debate had little effect on sterling today as the market comes to grips with PM Blair's commitment to a referendum and the Chancellor Brown's skepticism.   Meanwhile, USD/JPY kept within a133.50 to 134.00 range today after a brief rally to 134.04 after Former Japanese Finance Minister Sakakibara, aka Mr. Yen reiterated today his belief that the dollar could reach 150-160 yen towards year end. Sakakibara says Japan is in a state of economic crisis and this could spread to the financial sector soon. USD/JPY then eased back towards support at 133.40/50. Resistance is seen at 133.70, 134.00 and 135.00. Support is seen at 133.40, 133.00, 132.65 and 132.35.  Sakakibara's view is widely held by the markets and reflects a growing unease with Japan's lax position towards reform and their inability to come up with a coherent plan that tackles deflation and the financial sector. Markets grew weary with Japanese rhetoric on Tuesday after listening intently last week to a number of assurances to shore up the financial system and tackle deflation. The market was also disappointed by Japan's shying away on the injection of public funds into the troubled banking sector. Even though the yen fell, the Nikkei jumped 4.7% today on hopes that corporations would continue to write off bad debt and that the government would combat deflation.  Dealers are likely to remain on the sideline ahead of important economic news from the US later in the day and will keep eyes glued to Wall Street's performance. Weekly jobless claims due at 8:30 AM are expected to be unchanged from the previous week at 373,000, while January lead indicators, due at 10:00 AM, are forecast to rise 0.5% from 1.2% last month. Markets will also focus on today's US international trade balance, which is expected to widen to -28.3 billion in December from the previous deficit of 27.8 billion as sluggish global demand takes its toll on US exports.  But today's key data is the Philadelphia Fed survey of manufacturing activity for February, which is expected to decline to 13.0 from the previous 14.7. Yet, improvements in the NAPM component could be a boost.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Again, the Japanese were main sellers of yen after Monday's corrective buying gave way to a 2% sell-off over the past two trading days. The euro also rose by the same amount, but has failed to reach new highs since its 2-year peak of 119.71 last week. Meanwhile, USD was relatively unchanged in London trade against the euro and sterling but added to overnight gains against the Swiss franc.  The market continued to react to overnight comments by Japanese monetary officials that showed their acceptance of a weaker yen. Japan's top financial diplomat, Kuroda, said on Wednesday that the country's FX policy remained unchanged despite the yen's rapid 10% decline over the past 2 months. Economics Minister Takenaka also said late last night that following his meetings with US economic officials he saw the US economy rebounding more quickly than previously thought and that weakness in JPY was not ""far off economic fundamentals"" for the struggling Japanese economy. Although Takenaka later admitted that he did not discuss FX levels with US officials, his comments carried with it the implicit impression that the US was fine with a weaker yen  Japanese officials are now likely to remain quiet ahead of PM Koizumi's 7-day tour around southeast Asia which begins today. Although US monetary officials have expressed a desire to let markets determine FX rates, countries such as China and Korea have voiced concern about Japan exporting their deflation to the rest of the area. In the absence of further encouragement and the fact that JPY is technically oversold a period of consolidation would not be unusual. But any correction in USD/JPY would likely hold around 130-132 dealers say.   CHF fell on the back of a further rise in Swiss unemployment to 2.4% in December from 2.1% in November. This showed the labor market coming under increased pressure as economic weakness permeates the economy. But markets paid more attention to Swiss National Bank Vice-Chairman Gehrig who reportedly said in an interview that the SNB's next move could be either up or down. This surprise comment caught markets off guard and given that the economy should show flat growth in H2 2002, as well as the central bank's dissatisfaction with the current strong CHF exchange rate, traders sold the franc versus the euro and dollar.  USD/CHF rose to a new high of 1.6591 in European trade after breaking key resistance at 1.6575/80. The dollar's renewed strength since touching uptrend support at 1.6350 last week has been bullish for the pair and next resistance is seen at 1.6650 and 1.6680. Support is seen at 1.6510 and 1.6475. EUR/CHF also rose to a high of 1.48.  Meanwhile, the dollar hovered in a tight range against the euro and sterling as both EUR/USD and GBP/USD showed little decisive price action.  EUR/USD tested key support at 89.10, which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. Overnight, the pair briefly tested resistance at 89.50, but was rejected. Now, failure to maintain above 89.10/20 would probably call for a test lower to 87.60/40. Looking at the hourly chart, EUR/USD has traded neatly within the 38.2% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. These levels are 90.72 and 87.64 respectively and were tested on December 17, 25 and most recently on January 2 when the single currency reached a high of 90.63.  GBP/USD also looks weak as resistance at 1.4440 has proved hard to break. Cable's position has worsened since failing to break through resistance at 1.4547 on January 2. This level marks the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 1.51 to 1.3680. Cable is now trading at a day's low of 1.4388, which also marks the 50% retracement of the same move. A close below this level would target 1.4360, followed by 1.4340, 1.4300 and 1.4250. Resistance is eyed at 1.4440, 1.4480, 1.450 and 1.4550.  In the UK, attention continues to center around that debate and the dilemma now faced by the Bank of England over whether or not to ease rates for the struggling manufacturing sector in light of robust consumer spending. The BoE's monetary policy committee meeting on Thursday is expected to leave rates unchanged at 4.0%. However, unexpectedly strong consumer spending released last week prompted BoE Governor George to express some concern, saying that if demand did not abate the central bank would raise rates as soon as the economy recovered.   EUR/GBP also fell to a day's low of 61.88. Support at 61.70 should maintain, but the high of 62.80 reached on January 2 in the wake of europhoria and renewed EMU debate could be seen as a selling opportunity say dealers who see strength in euro abating.   Meanwhile, the single currency's prospects were also hurt by rising fears in Argentina over the possible collapse of the new economic plan, given that the euro is the most exposed of the major western currencies. In addition, the Eurozone business climate indicator fell to -1.23 in December from -1.20 in November, for a 10th consecutive month, and to the lowest since July 96.  Also worrisome was the fact that E-12 Q3 labor costs rose 3.3%, more than the previous 2.7% in Q3 and above expectations of  2.6%.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Markets wary of possible forex intervention from Japanese government after a series of verbal warnings that rapid yen's strength is not in line with economic fundamentals. The Japanese currency was little impacted by news that the Government Pension Investment Fund would increase its weighting of foreign bonds to 3 trillion yen or 8% from 6%, as it also invests another 11 trillion yen in domestic stocks over the next seven years. The FSA is continuing with its special inspections of large banks in fiscal 2002 in an effort to force them to dispose of more bad loans. Last November, the agency began inquiring firms whose stock prices or credit ratings had fallen and which had more than 10 billion yen in outstanding loans. The Nippon Research Institute announced that Japanese consumers are becoming more optimistic about their home finances in the coming year. February's consumer sentiment index rose 3 point higher from December to 155. Japan Feb net foreign bond selling was 637.1 bln yen (Jan Y3.0712 trln selling). Foreigners' Feb net Japan bond selling 1.0420 trrln yen (Jan Y1.2368 trln buying). Foreigners Feb net Japan stock selling 142.2 bln yen (Jan Y234.2 bln buying). Resistance is eyed at 129.20, followed by 129.65, 130.65 and 131.65 which marks the 38.25, 50%, and 61.8% retracements of the move from 134.95 to 126.32. Support holds at 128.0, 127.60, and 127.0. Subsequent support is seen at the 200-day moving average of 125.16.  EUR/USD is hovering around 87.45 after Eurozone Q4 GDP data showed the first contraction since 1993 as it fell to -0.2% q/q from the previous 0.1%, or to 0.6% y/y from the previous 1.4%. Analysts projected that Eurozone Q4 GDP would decline to -0.8% in a sharp contrast to a US growth rate of 1.4% in the same period that highlights stronger economic vitality in the US this year. Upside capped at 87.60, 88.10--the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move between the 90.63 high to the 85.63 low, 88.50-- the 200-day moving average, and 88.70-- the 61.8% retracement of the aforementioned move. Support is seen at 87.0, 86.70 and 86.0-- the support point lying on trend line extending from the 83.50 low through the 85.63 low.   Markets await tomorrow's release of US retail sales, which are expected to rise to 0.9% in February from the previous -0.2%, or to 3.6% y/y from the previous 2.8%, boosted by surprisingly robust light vehicle sales.  This week's US economic highlight include retail sales, jobless claims, business inventories, import/export prices, current account balance, PPI, industrial production, and the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey. Key Eurozone indicators consist of Spanish CPI, ECB monthly bulletin, French employment, French industrial production, Italian industrial production, German retail sales, French trade balance, and Italian CPI.

But the dollar gave up more ground against the yen as the Japanese continue to repatriate funds ahead of March. Today's warning by Moody's rating agency that it was prepared to downgrade Japan's domestic yen rating as early as next month helped solidify fears amongst the Japanese. Meanwhile, fading weak yen rhetoric and a stabilizing Nikkei helped shore up the sell off of Japanese assets, thereby lending support to the yen.  Initially, USD/JPY rose to a day's high of 133.37 following the news that the downgrade would be at least two notches from the current Aa3. However, the yen was able to rise to a day's high of 132.23 after tripping stop loss orders around USD/JPY support at 132.50. EUR/JPY fell to a low of 115.73, down from a day's high of 116.80 and well off Tuesday's high of 117.52. USD/JPY support now seen at 132.20 followed by 131.90 and 131.20.  USD/JPY is likely to trade in a range between 130 to 135 into the month of March. Despite the fact that the market is convinced of further yen weakness to come this year, JPY remains supported in the short term. JPY losses should also be contained to 135 against the dollar now that Japanese officials eased off their weak yen policy last week.  Moreover, USD/JPY came off Monday's high of 135 after this weekend's announcement that the government might inject as much as $US 78 billion into the financial sector. This has halted the sell off in Japanese assets by foreign investors we saw last month. The Nikkei rose over 4% from last weeks lows.  Recent data from the MoF shows that in January, foreigners' net Japan bond selling rose to Y1.2368 trln from a mere Y172.22 bln in December. Therefore, this side of the repatriation equation has settled down and JPY should remain supported by recent capital flows data for February which showed Japanese investors sold an unusually large 575.6 billion yen ($4.30 billion) in foreign securities last week, the sixth straight week of net sales. This should keep Japanese repatriation fears until the end of March when the fiscal year ends.  Meanwhile, the dollar traded steady against the European majors today as dealers await today's US retails sales report for January. Declining vehicle sales and low gas prices will weigh on total January retail sales growth, which is expected at flat to slightly negative. However, excluding auto sales, core retail sales should show its first a slight rise as consumer confidence remains strong. Markets are therefore anxious to know how the consumer reacted in January after a strong spending binge in December. A better than expected figure would be bullish for the dollar as it would show one cannot underestimate the US consumer   even in a recession.  EUR/USD held near a day's low of 87.41, which marks key support for the pair. On Tuesday, offers at 88.00/10 kept a cap on EUR/USD again after Monday's wave of stop-loss buying failed to develop into more sustainable demand for the euro. A break below 87.40 would target 87.10/00 and a break of that level would be the first strong confirmation of resumption in the euro's bear trend.  Yet, even if the euro holds above 87.40, it still needs to clear 88 cents followed by key resistance at 88.75/80 to remove its bearish outlook. That level marks the 61.8% retracement of this year's high to low of 90.63 to 85.63. Looking forward, unless the single currency can rise above the 88.80-cent level, its momentum should wane and turn back south again.  The euro also added to losses against the pound as it fell to a new low of 60.99 pence. The euro began to weaken against the pound after a test of 61.95 last Friday was rejected. Tuesday's break below 61.55 support triggered stop loss sales on its way to a low of 61.32. Therefore, renewed pressure on the pair could carry it back towards this month's lows around 60.68 pence. This would cause the euro to give up any further gains on the back of a rise in GBP/USD.  Sterling rose to a new 3-week high of 1.4362 following surprisingly upbeat UK jobs data which raised the expectations of the Bank of England raising rates later this year. Official data showed UK unemployment unexpectedly fell back by seasonally-adjusted 10,600 in January, instead of rising. Tuesday's jump in inflation data also highlighted buoyant domestic economy and fanned expectations of higher interest rates, which tend to benefit sterling.   However, the pound gave up some of those gains after the BoE's inflation report cited little risk to rising interest rates as long as the risks to growth remain to the downside. The bank said in its inflation report that it sees RPIX to trend near the targeted 2.5% by year end and for GDP to rise to around trend of 2.5% as well by end 2002. However, the key risks are the imbalances in the UK economy. GBP/USD resistance is seen at 1.4340, which marks the 61.8% retracement of the move from 1.4515-1.4040 move. Follow up resistance at 1.4410 and 1.4520. Support seen at previous resistance levels of 1.4235 and 1.4180.  USD/CHF rose to a day's high of 1.6907 but is still struggling to maintain above resistance at 1.6880 after a strong rebound from yesterday's low of 1.6779. For the near term USD/CHF needs to maintain above 1.6820 to avoid further fall to the 1.6685 area. This level marks the 61.8% retracement of the 1.6350-1.7229 rally, which should hold dealers say. Resistance is seen at 1.6880.  Today will also be a busy day on Wall Street after the retail sales data with numerous companies reporting Q401 earnings results. Key companies include Hewlett-Packard, Intuit, and Marriott International.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

"RE: Investment companies","It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

I will investigate getting an accounting entity set up for ECTMI - does anyone know the number?

in the meantime (and don't shout at me Tom) how easy would it be to change the ECTEF
broker account to have a new name - see company below

Subject:	Investment companies

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Regards,

Kevin

EUR/USD fell half a cent to a five-week low of 89.81, putting it at pre-September 11 levels. EUR/JPY also hit a three-week low of 108.90 yen. The headline figure fell to 85.0 in September from 89.5 the previous month, but the Ifo's head economist, Nerb, said the sharp drop in sentiment might have been an overreaction to attacks on U.S. cities. Nerb also said the index could stabilize next month and that its September reading did not yet signal a new downward trend. Nevertheless, the figure was the worst in eight years and will put the European Central Bank under intense pressure next week to lower rates.   According to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development's latest release, the outlook for world economies is now the worst since 1982. Average growth in 2001 is estimated to be just 1.0%, followed by a sub-par 2.8% average in 2002. US 2002 growth was revised down to 1.3% from the earlier 3.1%, while Japanese 2002 growth is now expected to contract by 0.8% from earlier projections of 1.1% growth. Therefore, with EU 2002 growth forecast now revised to 1.5% from 2.7%, and no bottoming in the zone's largest economy, European monetary policy will again be at the forefront of trader's minds next week ahead of the ECB's next meeting on Thursday.  Following the Ifo, ECB member Liebscher said it was the work of politicians, not central bankers, to ensure economic growth. That may be, and today's Ifo survey may also be an overreaction. But, there is also a possibility of a contraction in German Q4 growth that would put even FinMin Eichel's 0.75% 2001 growth target at risk. That means the longer the ECB waits, the worse it will be for the euro. Therefore, if the market encounters anything but a clear indication for a cut, the euro will come under further pressure next week, possibly testing downtrend channel support around 89.50.   Other European majors came under pressure against the dollar as well. Sterling fell to an eight-week low against the dollar, which benefited from the euro's losses against the dollar. Moreover, news on Thursday of a sharp slowdown in British retail sales growth continued to weigh on the pound. But, dealers noted the weaker figures had already been discounted and that the Bank of England left the door open for more rate cuts if needed. GBP/USD briefly broke below the 1.44 level to a day's low of 1.4388 in the wake of the Ifo release. However, sterling soon regained 1.4400, which is the key 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 1.37 to last Monday's 8-1/2 month high of 1.4836. Only a sustained break of the August 28 low of 1.4375 is seen increasing the bearish outlook for sterling. Key support stands at 1.44, while resistance is seen at 1.4450 followed by 1.4500.  The Swiss franc also fell fell 3/4 centimes against the dollar, but then regained that ground. The muted reaction could be due to the recurring safe-haven flows ahead of the weekend as seen in past weeks. U.S. troops are now in Afghanistan, and with the conflict expected to escalate, the US is on high alert for more terrorist attacks. USD/CHF rose to a session high of 1.6447 and is now seen supported above the key 1.64 level. Ability to maintain support above 1.63 would maintain bullish trend in USD/CHF as it targets the 1.65 level. However, any major negative developments for the US, at home or abroad, would quickly translate into gains for the franc.  USD/JPY hovered in a tight range today after spending most of the week in-between 120.80 and 121.80. The yen edged slightly lower against the dollar as the market braced for Japan's preliminary tertiary industry activity index for August due on Monday. But, the yen was supported by its gains against the euro after the weak Ifo index pushed the single currency lower across the board. Also supporting the yen was the approval of a basic extra budget framework by a panel of economic advisers to PM Koizumi. FinMin Shiokawa proposed a 3 trillion yen extra budget, but only 1.68 trillion would be financed by government bonds, thereby leaving JGB issuance under the 30 trln cap promised by Koizumi under his reform campaign.  Today earnings and economic data from the US are not expected to have much influence over the markets. The US trade deficit is expected to hold steady around 28.7 billion, and a temporal rise in gas price is expected to push inflation (CPI) higher in September, but fall in October. Moreover, markets are not worried about inflation because the Fed is still expected to cut rates again this year. Meanwhile, deterioration in Q3 earnings was no worse than expected this week and Q4 forecasts are still the same as previous estimates. Therefore, with very few earnings announcements today markets will likely move more on events linked to the war on terrorism.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

MoF's top diplomat Mizoguchi said:  It is not good for daily market moves to be too large . These comments were also echoed by Takashi Imai, the head of Keidanren, Japan's leading business lobby. Although Mr. Imai expressed cautiousness with the pace of the decline, he described the 130 yen point as a level at which:  both the U.S. and Japan can accept without having to intervene.  But the most abrupt comment on the soaring exchange rate came from Mizoguchi's predecessor Eisuke Sakakibara who said that:  it's realistic to think the (dollar) could go to Y140 or Y150 (next) summer,"" given Japan's sever economic conditions. The yen first broke the 130 level in early Monday trading in Japan after the BoJ downgraded the nation's economic assessment for the seventh consecutive month.   USD/JPY is looking increasingly toppish at 130.88 followed by 131 and 131.20-25. A break 131.75 faces key pressure at 132. Support escalates to 130.50, backed by 130.20 and 129.75.   On Tuesday, the BoJ published the minutes of last month's meeting in which its voted 8-1 to maintain monetary policy unchanged. The record showed the majority of board members were in agreement that the Bank did not need to buy foreign bonds as a means to shore up liquidity.  But several members did express the need to reconsider the Bank's liquidity provisions including diversifying into the purchase of foreign bonds as a possible measure in the future.   It was last week, when the BoJ announced raising its reserve target at commercial banks to 14 trillion yen from over 6 trillion yen and boosted monthly purchases of Japanese Government Bonds to 800 billion yen from 600 billion yen.  On the data front, Japan's corporate services prices were reported to have fallen 0.1% in the month ending in November and 1.2% on a y/y basis.    In the Wednesday session, the Nikkei posted its 4ths consecutive daily decline, losing 62 pts to close 10192, its lowest level since November 1st.   EUR/USD nears its session lows of 8767, further retreating from the 88.20 cent-high in Asian trading. Initial support stands at 8725, which is the 61.8% Retracement of the move from 9350 to 8350.  A break under 87 cents faces key support at 86.50 cents, which rests in the support line of the downward channel extending from 8950 to 8735.Upside capped at 8820 followed by 8875.

These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

The speech before the Senate Budget Committee is expected to be more upbeat than his last, but dealers are likely to hold back on further dollar bidding as they pay heed to Greenspan's words.   Gains in USD/JPY outpaced the crosses, which actually fell to 3-day lows. EUR/JPY fell to a low of 117.60 from an overnight high above 119.00. GBP/JPY also fell to a low of 191.05 after hitting an overnight 30-month high of 192.20 on weak yen sentiment. This divergence is one of the catalysts to the dollar's strong gains against EuroFX today.  EUR/USD fell to a 1-month low of 87.59, dangerously close to key channel support at 87.50 which marks the 31.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. A break below that level would likely call upon further steep losses as the single currency has consistently failed to maintain above 90-cents. Temporary moves higher are not seen by the market as indicating strength, and are regarded as selling opportunities, dealers say.  The euro is likely to remain under pressure in the near term after sliding across the board on Wednesday following European Central Bank president Duisenberg's assertion that interest rates are on hold for the time being and that Germany's rising budget deficit was a further concern. By straightjacketing Germany, the ECB has nearly assured that the economy's engine of growth will continue to lag behind the rest of the Eurozone.  A more positive response is expected from Greenspan today after markets concluded that the Fed Chairman probably sounded more pessimistic about the economy than he intended in his speech on January 11. Moreover, given the recent squabble between Democrats and Republicans over who wasted the surpluses, Greenspan is also is likely to be questioned on his support for last year's tax cuts which Democrats claim are responsible for the elimination of budget surpluses and subsequent return to deficits.  The US budget surplus was once projected to total more than $5 trillion over the next 10 years, but recent estimates by the Senate Budget Committee show that the recession is likely to cost $1.366 billion on top of the $1.683 bln that will go to present and future tax cuts. Senate majority leader Daschle is likely to argue for a suspension of future tax cuts. But, Greenspan may reiterate his support for tax cuts to hasten and ensure a rebound, especially since it would spur consumer spending and stem the reduction in business investment. He will also likely say that the budget became a deficit due to the recession, and the resultant war following the September 11 attacks.   Nevertheless, the recent budget deficits projected by the CBO on Wednesday sent the bond market reeling as interest rates on 10-year Treasuries jumped to almost 5% from 4.91%, as the deficit figures were higher than some analysts predicted. This could also be a point of contention among Democrats who know Greenspan to endorse lower long term interest rates over deficit spending.  Meanwhile, markets will also listen to Greenspan's assessment of the economy to gauge whether there is a chance of a rate cut at the Jan 30 meeting. Interest rate futures are pricing in only a 22% chance, leaving the majority to believe rates will hold steady at 1.75%, a 40-year low. However, since the dollar index is trading near 6-month highs, most dealers are now divided over whether a further rate cut would help the dollar.  Following Greenspan, the market is likely to react to earnings announcements and the economic outlook from companies such as Eli Lilly, Eastman Kodak, Gateway, JDS Uniphase, McDonald s, Nokia, Phillips Petroleum, PMC-Sierra, Qualcomm and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, who are reporting today. But it is Greenspan's assessment of the economy that is likely to direct Wall Street and the dollar.  While most believe the recession will be over this year, the key concern now is that economists and investors are again uncertain as to how strong growth will be when it resumes. The first question is whether investment spending will recover substantially now that inventory liquidation has run its course? The second question is whether consumer final demand will be strong enough in 2002 to warrant new business spending?   The risk is that consumers will be slow to take on additional debt, given their current debt loads, and this will cause the recovery to take another fall   called a double dip - until there is a more profound correction from past over investment. This can be seen in recent Wall Street losses as investors question the likelihood of future earnings growth this year.  GBP/USD broke below key support at 1.4220 and plunged to a day's low of 1.4202 after the UK's BCC said service firms export sales and orders reached rock bottom with the export balance at -7 vs +1 in Q3. BCC says circumstances continue to be dire and sterling's technical position vs the dollar looks likely to come under further strain if it cannot maintain above 1.4220, which marks the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from the January 8, 2001 high of 1.5101 to the June 12, 2001 low of 1.3680. Next support is seen at 1.420 and 1.4160. Upside capped at 1.430, 1.4360 and 1.440.  USD/CHF also regained its bullish momentum after a 7 franc surge in late December retraced back to 1.6350 earlier this month. Swissy rose to a 3-week high of 1.6778 after surging back through resistance at 1.6725. Support is seen at 1.6725 followed by 1.6660/80.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

December 27, 2001


NYMEX BOARD EXTENDS A MODIFIED

[IMAGE] Forums Discuss these points in the Forums:  Forexnews Forum       Technicals Live Charts Analysis available from: Cornelius Luca   J.P. Chorek   Technical Research Ltd.   Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  February 25, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8693 $/JPY..133.83 GBP/$..1.4253 $/CHF..1.6972  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  by Darko Pavlovic  No key data.   The yen retained the upper hand against the dollar around 133.80, boosted by Japan's trade surplus that came in above 118 billion yen in January, whereas its surplus with the US rose for the first time in 10 months by 14.9% y/y to 524.8 bln yen. The latest data is to suggest that increasing US demand and weaker yen levels could benefit Japanese exports. In addition, Japanese currency found strength as a result of repatriation flows before the fiscal year ends in March. Latest report show that anti deflationary package due on Wednesday will be a two part plan: the government will provide for measures to stabilize stock market and ask the BoJ for more easing. The second more important part of the plan will likely be revealed at the end of March and will outline tax changes and tackling the bad loans debt. Thursday meeting of the BoJ is not likely to produce any rate cut although that question remains open. If the central bank does not ease monetary policy, the yen could weaken as traders express their disappointment by unloading the currency. However, if the BoJ does inject liquidity by raising its purchases of government bonds, the yen is also likely to weaken. Markets will scrutinize news conferences from Financial Minister Shiokawa, Economic Minister Takenaka and Financial Services Minister Yanagisawa. Japan's Fin Services Minister Yanagisawa was not considering new steps on bad loans in anti-deflation package. Yanagisawa explained that he had not received report on Bank report steps for Daiei According to a telephone survey released Monday by Tokyo's TV 12 the support rate for the cabinet of PM Koizumi fell to 48.4%, the first time it has fallen below 50% since it took office last April. The approval rating now stands below the 55.6% the cabinet received in the previous survey conducted in late January, immediately after Koizumi fired Foreign Minister Tanaka. Support holds at 133.20, 133.0 and 132.50. Upside capped at 134.0, 134.40 and 134.90.   EUR/USD is trading around just below 87 cents weighed by an unofficially released German jobless count for February showing a 30,000 rise to 4.32 mln, along with the news that Germany's cartel office blocked Deutsche Telekom's planned sale of its cable assets to US media group Liberty Media in a deal worth $4.81 billion. Investors are undoubtedly concerned about funneling their assets into a highly regulated European region. In mid-morning, the euro's slide was temporarily reversed as markets reacted to a fall in Germany preliminary CPI to 0.3% m/m from 0.9% or to 1.7% y/y from the previous 2.1%. German preliminary harmonised CPI also dipped to 0.3% m/m from the previous 1.0%, or to 1.9% y/y from the previous 2.3%. The Statistics office cited drops in heating oil and fuel prices as the primary reasons behind February's fall in inflation, which sparked hope that the European Central Bank would be able to lower interest rates.Nonetheless, the single currency was unable to find comfort in European Central Bank president Duisenberg's optimism that the world economy would rebound modestly, and that the Eurozone would grow close to its long-term trend between 2-2.5% by the end of the year. Markets now await tomorrow's release of the German Ifo business sentiment survey that is forecasted to rise to 87.3 in February from the previous 86.3, reflecting the improvement seen in the ZEW sentiment survey. Support is seen at 86.80, 86.45/50 and 86.10. Resistance is viewed at 87.85, 88.10 and the 200-day moving average at 88.50.  Tomorrow morning's release of the US Conference Board consumer confidence index is forecasted to slip to 96.8 in February from the previous 97.3, mirroring the decline in the University of Michigan survey. However, some analysts anticipate the index will edge up slightly because the U. Michigan survey places more weight on stock prices, which have fallen recently on accounting concerns. This week's other key US indicators include durable goods, new home sales, jobless claims, GDP, Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, personal income and consumption, University of Michigan confidence survey, ISM (formerly NAPM) PMI. In the midst of all the economic releases, markets will be carefully listening to Fed Chairman Greenspan's semi-annual monetary policy testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday for any hint that the central bank may begin to raise interest rates sometime this year.   Major data due for release from the Eurozone comprise the German Ifo business climate indicator, French CPI, Italian foreign trade, Euroarea M3, German GDP, French INSEE industry survey, French PPI, Italian retail sales, Belgian CPI, Euroarea HICP, German PPI, French unemployment, Italy's ISAE industrial confidence survey, Italian PPI, Euroarea manufacturing PMI, Euroarea retail sales, German manufacturing PMI, French manufacturing PMI, France's INSEE household survey, Italian manufacturing PMI, Italian CPI, Italian GDP, and Spanish unemployment. Highlights from the UK are GDP, Gfk consumer confidence, nationwide house price index and the manufacturing Puchasing Managers survey. Major data releases from Japan are commercial sales, industrial production, Shoko Chukin small firm survey, housing starts, consumer prices, household survey of expenditures and the labor force survey.

"(01-448) EXCHANGE TO CHANGE EARLY CLOSING TIME FOR COAL","Notice No. 01-448
December 28, 2001

TO:		ALL EXCHANGE MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS
		ALL CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:	J. ROBERT COLLINS, JR., PRESIDENT

RE:		EXCHANGE TO CHANGE EARLY CLOSING TIME FOR COAL

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., announced today that it will change
the early closing time for coal futures to 12:30 P.M. for days that the
Exchange has designated for early closings.

These days include December 31, 2001, and January 18; February 15; May 24;
August 30; and December 24 and 31 in 2002.

The change reflects the abbreviated trading hours under which the Exchange
has been operating since September 17 and will remain in place until the
hours are extended. All other open outcry energy markets except propane
futures will continue to cease at 1:00 P.M. on those days. Propane futures
close at 12:15 P.M.  The early closing for aluminum and palladium will
remain at noon; silver and copper will end at 12:05 PM on those days; and
gold and platinum will close at 12:10 P.M. Electricity futures will close at
its regular time of 9 A.M.

TO:		ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
		ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS
		ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBER FIRMS

FROM:	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:		EXCHANGE TO WAIVE LOX SURCHARGES
________________________________________________________

The executive committee of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today
announced that it would, until further notice, waive the surcharges
associated with large order execution (LOX) in natural gas futures.

Under the program, introduced on November 30, there was a $2.50 per contract
surcharge for receiving a response to a request for a quote on simultaneous
execution of a transaction of between 250 and 5,000 contracts, reduced to
$1.50 per contract if the trade was executed.

This move is being made to stimulate activity in this new instrument, which
we are confident will prove useful to both commercial sector participants
and major funds.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  December 23, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8967 $/JPY..129.52 GBP/$..1.4367 $/CHF..1.6507  Japanese Forex Trading Preview by Jes Black  No Key Data Today  The dollar went into the Christmas holiday season with a bang, ending Friday's US session up nearly 1.5% to against the euro at 88.67 and climbing to a fresh 3-year high 129.66. Supporting the dollar was the third consecutive rise in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey to 88.8 in the final December reading from the preliminary 85.8. This contrasted with lower than expected data from the Eurozone and the Bank of Japan's seventh straight month of lowering their assessment of the economy. Optimism for the US economy showing signs of recovery was enough to render the downward revision of Q3 GDP to 1.3% a mute point. Confidence in a forthcoming rebound was also enough to offset a 0.7% fall in consumer spending and a 0.1% fall in personal income.  EUR/USD fell to a low of 88.55 on Friday, undermined by a steep selloff in EUR/JPY to a low of 114.50 after failing to maintain gains above 116. Dealers took profit from the euro's 6-week climb against the yen to a fresh 2-year high of 116.61 on Friday. Dealers also noted that the pair had been on a steady decline since hitting a 6-week high of 90.78 on Monday and its failed attempts at maintaining above 90-cents were an ominous sign.  GBP/USD was also dragged lower by the fall in EUR/USD as well as losses in GBP/JPY. Cable hit a 10-day low of 1.4344 as sterling shed most of its 3.5-yen rise to a new 2-year high of 188.26. Nevertheless, the pound reached a 5-week high of .6156 against the euro as broad based weakness in the single currency weighed it down. Aside from euro weakness, sterling was also supported by remarks from Bank of England Governor George who said that there was a serious risk from a one size fits all monetary policy and that the persistent weakness of the euro was creating problems for the British economy. This highlighted the risk of the UK joining the euro given the ECB's reluctance to stimulate the economy despite the global downturn. Support is viewed at 1.4350, 1.430 and 1.4275. Upside capped at 1.4475, 1.4515 and 1.4550. The next key resistance is seen at 1.460- the upper bound of the downward channel between the October 8 high of 1.4829 to the December 17 high of 1.4607, and then 1.4755- the upward limit of the downward channel between the January 12 high of 1.5101 and the October 12 high of 1.4829.  USD/CHF skyrocketed by 2 centimes to a 1-week high of 1.6550 on dollar strength after the Swiss franc had reached a 4-day high of 1.6286. Safe-haven flows were seen boosting CHF as money flowed out of emerging markets following the announcement Argentina's debt crisis. Fears of default inflamed fears about Argentina's fragile economic situation, and prompted considerable purchases of the franc though that effect has since subsided. Resistance is seen at 1.6550, 1.6585 and 1.6650. Support stands at 1.6465, 1.640 and 1.6370. In contrast, the Swiss franc made headway to a 3-week high of 1.4598 against the declining euro.  Today's Asian trading session is likely to be marked by thin liquidity but dealers will remained focused on any comments coming out of Japan after last week's remarks showed little concern for a weaker yen. Japan's Ministry of Finance added fuel to the yen selling following international bureau chief Mizoguchi's reiteration that that the recent sharp decline was merely a correction of its excessive strength this summer. Dealers noted that the welcoming of a weaker yen could put JPY under further pressure in thin holiday trade this week. However, the focus from here will be how Japanese, US and Chinese officials react if USD/JPY passes 130 because of the trade implications of such a weak yen. But so far, traders in New York said it was not yet clear if the market would find the drive to test the psychologically critical 130 level this week after such a sharp run up in USD/JPY last week.

"(02-56) Options Expiration Operational Procedures for Copper (HXH	2) and Aluminum (OAH2)","Notice No. 02-56
February 19, 2002


TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
				All COMEX Division Clearing Members
				All COMEX Division Floor Traders
				All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
				Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing
				Members
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the March 2002 options contract for Copper (HXH2)
and Aluminum (OAH2) is Monday, February 25, 2002.
	GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

	TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


Trading in the March 2002 Copper and Aluminum Options Contracts will cease
at 1:00 P.M. and 1:10 p.m. respectively on February 25, 2002.  All Brokers
and Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions to
exercise or abandon such Options by 3:00 P.M.

On Monday, February 25, 2002, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special ""OLTE"" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Monday's submissions and processing will be
available on Tuesday morning February 26, 2002.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.


				CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
(""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

		Please note: Trade information reflected on the option
expiration report and transaction listing are trades submitted only. To
inquire whether trades have matched, each CM must review the trade reports
provided by COMEX's On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

(4)  Additional Termination Events:  use of rating downgrade Part 1(i) pages 2-3]
(5)  Delivery of documents [see page 5 comments]
(6)  elimination of ""non-reliance"" representation [pages 7-8]
(7)  elimination of affiliate setoff [pages 8-9]

But the decline was short-lived after USD/JPY spiked to a day's high of 133.22 and then fell back to key support around 132.65 afterwards. EUR/USD also rose to a high of 114.88, but today's comments from S?were not enough to stem more corrective buying in JPY.  S&P's announcement was the major news in today's European session, but had little effect on the yen. Recently, an S?official described Japan's banking system as  technically insolvent  and the market now recognizes that Japan will have to do something about its problem loan situation. The S?also said that Japan's economic stagnation has turned into a worrisome deflationary recession with no sign of upturn. And, further delay in structural reform or economic recovery will increase possibility of sovereign downgrade.  USD/JPY fell after it failed for a second time in two days to break resistance at 133.20. This follows Monday's failed attempt at 135.00 and the dollar is now looking to test trendline support from the November low of 119.70 which currently lies around 132.55. The pair must maintain above this level to avoid further corrective losses in USD/JPY. But this is unlikely if the pair moves sideways and a break of 132.50 would see a further move to 132.00 followed by 131.00. Key support stands at 129.10, which marks the 38.2% retracement of the 119.70 to 134.95 move. Meanwhile, the upside is capped at 133.20 and 133.60.  JPY has benefited recently from a letup by Japanese officials chiming in unison about yen weakness. Another point of contention this week will be whether the G7 meeting in Toronto and the World Economic Forum in New York become a sounding board for big global interests to bash the recent resurgence in the dollar against the yen. Manufacturers, like GM on Wednesday, are likely to complain that the state of the economy is now about at the same level just prior to the September 11 attacks, but the USD/JPY is trading near 40-month highs.  Meanwhile, the dollar was steady against European majors and recouped some of yesterday's losses against the pound after the US Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate unchanged at 1.75% and maintained its easing bias. The positive response by Wall Street was supportive of the dollar, especially given the recent Enron ripple effects felt on Tuesday's sell off of US equities. The dollar also rebounded sharply after US Q4 GDP rose 0.2% q/q, beating estimates of a second consecutive negative quarter. This showed the US has avoided a technical recession and the Fed's supportive remarks were bullish for the dollar.  EUR/USD held to a tight range of 86.00-86.40. The pair fell back to support at 86 cents after failing to hold onto gains above 86.30 overnight. But the single currency will need to regain the 86.80/90 mark to really improve its outlook. If not, it still looks vulnerable to fall back below 86.00 on its way to this week's 6-month low of 85.72. A break below this would then target 85.55, the 71.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.95. Resistance is viewed at 86.80, and the key 87.40/50 level which marks the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the same move.  Today's much anticipated German states' inflation came above expectations and is likely to prevent the European Central Bank from cutting interest rates soon, thereby weighing on the euro. German inflation surged upwards in January, but mainly because of tax increases and higher food prices rather than the impact of the euro changeover, according to preliminary data from the individual states.  Other data from the euro area was Italy's ISAE revision of 2002 GDP down to 1.5%. Meanwhile, the French jobless rate was steady at 9.0% in December compared with the previous month. Although the consensus was for a rise to 9.1%, the figure suggests that the euro area's second largest economy is stabilizing after a sharp economic downturn.  USD/CHF again tested resistance at 1.7140, which marks the ascending trendline resistance. Swissy fell back to a low of 1.7060 but remains well supported above 1.6945, the 50% retracement of the 1.8220 to 1.5770 move. Also keeping pressure on the france was the Swiss KoF indicator which fell to -1.37 in December from -1.28, marking a worsening of conditions, not a turnaround as many had hoped. Therefore, given the recent bullish data and positive outlook by the Fed, USD/CHF should remain well supported.  GBP/USD moves were dictated by the rise and fall in EUR/GBP today from a low of 60.84 to a high of 61.24, or a 0.7% swing in European trade. The rise in EUR/GBP put sterling under pressure to a day's low of $1.4090, but the subsequent reversal in EUR/GBP allowed cable to rise to a day's high of 1.4158. However, resistance at 1.4183, which marks the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the 1.4418-1.4038 move, has held so far. Barring a break of this resistance, renewed weakness could prevail. Support is seen at 1.4120 and 1.4080.  The sharp moves in sterling reflect a recently released poll from investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston which shows only a very small majority of Britons opposes joining Europe's single currency in the next two to three years. In contrast to a 70% opposition last year, the poll now showed 42% of those asked would support euro entry within the next two to three years while 46% were opposed.  The other data from the UK today showed a sharp rise in British consumer confidence in January to +6 from -1. This reflected yesterday's data showing net consumer credit rose more than expected in December to 2.166 billion pounds compared with a rise of 1.5 billion pounds in November. Despite recent data and reports on the UK economy which have highlighted disparities between manufacturing and consumption, the increase in consumer credit was seen as adding to consumption which has kept the economy afloat with robust growth. But they also reinforce the perception that the Bank of England will be reluctant to cut interest rates again any time soon.  Today's data from the US includes the release of Chicago PMI, which is forecasted to rise to 45.5 in January from the previous 41.4, mirroring the improvement seen in the ISM (formerly NAPM) survey. The pickup in the manufacturing sector is attributable to increased spending on durables and other goods, and therefore, US Personal consumption is expected to rise to 0.1% in December from the previous 0.7%. Personal income is also assumed to post a gain of 0.3% in December from the previous 0.1%, even though the Employment cost index is projected to hold steady at 1.0% in Q4.  Markets will again focus on Wall Street for direction and today's earnings announcements include AFLAC, Alcatel, Alliance Capital Management, Barnes & Noble.com, Delta Air Lines, Dole Food, Dow Chemical, KPMG Consulting and Walt Disney.

"(01-350) Copper Options Expiration Operational Procedures","Notice No. 01-350
October 22, 2001



TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and 			Clearing Members - Shortened Hours
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the November 2001 options contract for Copper (HX
X1) is Friday, October 26, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


The following schedule of operational procedures is based on shortened
trading hours as described in Notice to Members # 01-333
(http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/2001/ntm_333.htm)

Trading in the November 2001 Copper Options Contract will cease at 1:00 P.M.
on October 26, 2001.  All Brokers and Traders must inform their Clearing
Members of their intentions to exercise or abandon such Options by 3:00 P.M.


On Friday, October 26, 2001, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special ""OLTE"" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Friday's submissions and processing will be
available on Monday morning October 29, 2001.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
(""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 8:00 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

The dollar is trading around 133 yen after pulling back from three-year highs on Friday comments from Japanese FinMin Shiokawa that the yen fall was  too rapid . Markets  were also surprised after MoF chief diplomat Kuroda reversed himself that he saw no risk of further yen fall and warned that Japanese currency decline last week had been excessive. Many analysts believe that the government could overturn its laissez faire approach toward weak yen as foreign investors continue to flee from Japan and under more pressure from Asian neighbors, which could depreciate their own currencies. Also, dealers are more cautious ahead of G-7 meeting this week in Toronto. On Friday Nikkei fell to a 4-month low of 9791, below the DJIA's level for the first time in over 40 years..The yen benefited last week by S&P's assurance that it did not plan to downgrade Japanese debt any further for the time being. Finance Minister Shiokawa expressed on Sunday hope that the economic growth rate would pull out of negative territory to zero by this autumn, now that the economy including its exports are improving. The government will try to reach 1.5% growth in fiscal 2003 by forging ahead with structurally reforming the economy. Prime Minister Koizumi will ask top bureaucrats on Monday to cut uncertain ties with politicians in relation to recent problems involving the Foreign Ministry. New Foreign Minister Kawaguchi and U.S. Secretary of State Powell on Sunday agreed in a phone conversation to advance relations between Japan and the United States, ahead of U.S. President George W. Bush's visit to Japan this month. Support is viewed at 132.60 and 132.40. Resistance is seen at 135.05, 135.25 and 136.0.   EUR/USD is trading round 86.20 boosted by Friday's release of the Eurozone PMI, which exceeded forecasts by rising for the third straight month to 46.2 in January from the previous 44.1. Even though the PMI remained in contraction territory for the tenth month, markets were optimistic about the Eurozone's prospects for a turnaround.   However, Euroarea inflation jumped to 2.5% y/y in January from the previous 2.1%, thereby dampening expectations for an ECB rate cut next week. The aforementioned data, along with the euro's plunge to a 6-month low of 85.64 in European trading, led 41 out of 45 economists in a recent Reuters poll to predict that the European Central Bank will leave rates unchanged at 3.25%. Upside capped at 86.60, 87.0 and 87.50. Support holds at 85.55-- the 71.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.95, backed by 85.0.  Looking forward to this week, key US economic releases include factory orders, ISM (formerly NAPM) Non-manufacturing PMI, Q4 productivity, jobless claims, consumer credit and wholesale trade. From the Eurozone, major indicators consist of Euroarea business and consumer confidence survey, PPI, Services PMI, German Services PMI, French Services PMI, Italian Services PMI, unemployment, French INSEE industry survey, Spanish industrial production, German unemployment, ECB rate decision, German manufacturing orders, German industrial production and Dutch CPI. Highlights from Japan are the trade balance, indices of business conditions, ESRI Tokyo consumer sentiment, money supply, wholesale prices and machinery orders.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Argyle's 2000 vintage Pinot Noir is available now and it's time to stock up on this excellent value before

Flavors lean toward black fruits; black cherries and blackberries with a small earthy and seasoned cedar component.. Medium-bodied, this wine is unctuous with big fruit and a firm tannin finish sanded by sweetness from the fruit flavors.. The finish is long with a nice balance between sweet, ripe fruit and soft, chewy tannins. Drink now or cellar three to four years.

 Merlot 99 $29.99 - A very fruit forward, well-balanced wine displaying tantalizing flavors. The nose greets you with black fruits, hints of tobacco, and whispers of coconut and vanillin. The mouth bursts with bing cherries, while the finish suggests essences of Russian olive and light oak. Elegant structure gives this wine moderate aging ability though is very enjoyable now.
Cabernet Sauvignon 99 $32.99- A very rich and complex wine, dark red in color. Flavors of ripe plum and vanillin lead off the nose with hints of spice, mocha and black fruits in the mouth. The well-rounded tannins make the expansive mouth feel soft yet structured. A big, lingering finish completes this gorgeous wine. 92 Points Wine Enthusiast
 Syrah 99  $29.99- A wine possessing deep, rich color. The nose reflects aromas of baking spices and blueberries while the mouth hints of raspberries and apricots. The very light influence of oak allows the true essence of the fruit be revealed. The wine is very soft in the mouth with well-integrated tannins that define a very balanced wine with an elegant, seamless finish.

Seven Hills Winery
http://www.avalonwine.com/seven-hills-winery.htm 
There's a new article by our staff writer Christina Kelly 
on the Seven Hills Winery here:http://www.avalonwine.com/seven-hills-winery.htm 
Syrah 99- very limited Softer tannins and very broad, full mid-palate flavors characterize this wine. The aroma is of red fruits and smoky Syrah varietal character, surrounded by complex oak tones of spice and vanilla. There's a great balance on the palate, with a natural harmony and brightness between fruit, acidity and tannins.

Jean's Choices this month
I don't usually put my own preferences out, but this month, there are some great ""sleeper"" wines and some excellent prices that you might miss while wandering through the 3600+ pages that are the Avalon site (Argh!! How did I do that!!)  I've been tasting wines like crazy for the last month, and some of these are really lovely, but they haven't been reviewed yet, or they are too obscure to hit the press.  So here, for what it's worth, are the wines that, as work on the website,  I type in and say to myself ""I hope they find this, it's a good one!""
 
Andrew Rich Cuvee B Pinot Noir 99 $15.99
Cuvee B Pinot Noir is made from the same grapes as his regular 99 Pinot Noir, but from younger vines or graes that did not quite make the cut for his 99 blend. This is a happy mood making, easy drinking Pinot with lots of spice and soft red cherry fruit. A GREAT DEAL!http://www.oregongourmet.com/andrew-rich-cuvee-b.html 
Beaux Freres Belles Soeurs Shea 2000 $44.99 regular $49.99
The best wine from Shea Vineyard I've ever had. Incredibalievable!   A yumm bucket.
http://www.oregongourmet.com/beaux-freres-belles-soeurs-shea-2000.html 
 
Broadley Marcile Loraine 2000 $49.99
Morgan Broadley told me a restaurant's staff  that came to the winery to taste drank up his whole tasting bottle in a jiffy and I can tell you they had good reason to. This is stellar Pinot Noir in the Broadley tradition. VERY VERY LIMITED. The nose was full of truffles and bitter chocolate and a hint of licorice that I find in most of the Broadley estate wines. The flavors were layered and complex, with every kind of spice and seasoning entwined with big black fruit, cassis, plum, and blackberry. The finish went on for 5 minutes, I think. The Claudia's Choice 2000 is just as good in its own way.http://www.oregongourmet.com/Broadley-Marcile-Loraine.html 
 
Fiddlehead Pinot Noir 96 $33.99
Kathy Josephs is one of the nicest people you could ever hope to meet, and she makes wonderful Pinot Noir. Based in Santa Barbara, she is better known in CA. In 1996 she started making a limited bottling of Oregon Pinot Noir, and we are so fortunate to have a supply of this wonderful wine. I tried it and it is drinking beautifully, and showing all the complexity and intriguing mystery of well made, well aged Pinot Noir. The wine has been perfectly cellared since bottling with no exposure to heat or shipping trauma.
I suggest a vertical tasting of her wines- we have the 96, 97, and 98 available. This wine is well worth a try, if only to see what well made Oregon Pinot Noir is capable of five years out.http://www.avalonwine.com/fiddlehead.htm 
 
High Pass Pinot Noir Walnut Ridge Vineyard 99 $35.99
High Pass Scheurbe Late Harvest 2000 375 ml $22.99
Dieter Boehm's vineyards are a stone's throw from Big Pink (Avalon's farm and web office) and as with Broadley (a stone's throw in a different direction), there's world class wine in the hills of the Monroe and Junction City! High Pass is the classic sleeper winery, making wines that the most experienced wine judges I know are ranking at the top of the list. Both of these wines are outstanding examples of their type. I wish I could afford to take home more of the late harvest wine- I can't pronounce it, but I sure like it. I thought is was as good as some of the $80 ice wines from Canada. And the Pinot is rich, almost buttery, with a meaty hit that would stand up well to roast leg of lamb. This could be a great choice for Easter dinner.http://www.avalonwine.com/highpass.htm 
 
Patricia Green Cellars Pinot Noir Estate 2000 $29.99
This wine tastes a lot like Beaux Freres' signature Pinot Noir, their Beaux Freres Vineyard Pinot Noir. The vineyard is right next to Beaux Freres' vineyard, so it makes sense, and Patricia is already pulling great fruit from it. In a few years, this will be the wine she is best known for. Or so I think. Huge Patty Green nose with warm, luscious black cherry and cassis hits along with a dense, earthy undertone that is rich and pleasant. The flavors are of dark blak fruits, spices like cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, a hint of violets and roses, and elegant complexity. The finish is long and silky. Patty is one of my favorite winemakers- her jolly disposition and passion for wine show through in all of her delicious wines. http://www.oregongourmet.com/product1939.html 
 
Thomas Pinot Noir 99 $29.99
He makes very little wine, and some vintages there is no wine as he does not find the grapes up to his standards. When he does drop by with wine, we dance in delight. A wine made with passion and great finesse, age for up to 10 years, classicly Burgundian, with layers and layers of fruit, spice, char and oak, and exotic hints of rose, cinnamon and incense.

		March 13, 2002  ---------BEAUX FRERES AND BROADLEY SALES ALMOST OVER!!!	
[IMAGE]	   Dear Wine lover  We've been offering  Broadley and Beaux Freres' new 2000 vintage Pinot noirs at a pretty big discount, and they are about to raise their prices by $10  a bottle. This is a great last minute chance to save a lot of  money (save about $120 a case!). And we are still offering a 10% discount off the sale price on a full case when you  use 3 day air to ship.   [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]               [IMAGE]  Beaux Freres winemaker Mike Etzel Trying the 2002 vintage   Beaux Freres  Pinot Noir 2000 $56.99 SALE  will be  $68.99 after Friday This is their standard bearer- their  flagship wine that gets such high ratings each year. The 99 was one of two Oregon wines on the ""2001 Wine Spectator Top 100 Wines  of the World"" list. This wine should do at least as well.   An excellent vintage from Ribbon Ridge, the 2000 has a deep  saturated ruby/purple color. Ripe black cherry, cola, and blackberry fruit dominate the bouquet. In the background a hint of spicy  oak can be discerned. Still youthful, this medium to full-bodied wine has a layered palate, moderate tannin and a sweet, long  finish. It is always difficult to compare one vintage to another, but 2000 may represent a hypothetical blend of 1998 and 1999. It  is not as powerful, muscular or tannic as the 1998 nor as forward, charming and accessible as the 1999. It is a big wine and  certainly ranks with our finest vintages to date: 1993, 1994, 1998, and 1999.   JEAN SAYS; THIS IS GREAT WINE! 4-12 YEAR CELLARING, A WINE TO STRETCH THE  POCKETBOOK FOR!  Beaux Freres  Belle Soeurs Shea Vineyard 2000 $44.99  SALE  will be $56.99 after Friday    Their finest Shea Vineyard offering to date. It displays a healthy  saturated dark ruby color with purple nuances. Shea tends to be a seductive, open-knit effort, even in a more tannic year such as  2000. Copious sweet, creamy, black cherry and berry fruit intermixed with toasty wood emerge from the wine's aromas. Medium to  full-bodied and fleshy, with more structure than previous vintages, the 2000 offers the vineyard's hallmark black fruit and a  silky, lusty, hedonistic personality. It should drink well young , and evolve nicely for a decade. Vineyard Manager: Dick  Shea.  Beaux Freres  Belle Soeurs Temperance Hill Vineyard  2000 $44.99 SALE will be $56.99 after Friday   Their first offering from Temperance Hill Vineyard, located in the Eola  Hills of the Willamette Valley. This dynamic wine possesses a saturated dark ruby color and a sweet nose of cranberry, strawberry  and black cherry fruit. An impressive attack is followed by moderate yet ripe tannin. The wine reveals seductive aromatics, fine  density, medium to full body, and plenty of material, but it will require a year or two of cellaring in order to shed its tannin.  At its best between 2004-2012. Vineyard Manager: Dai Crisp       Just in and exciting:  Chateau Ste Michelle Eroica 2001!!!  $25.99 just in!

These tickets are available to the entire NYMEX division members on a first
come, first served basis and can be obtained by sending a written request
(see attached application) to the Exchange's Houston office (see

are unavailable for both first and second choice or no second choice is
indicated and first choice is unavailable, then NYMEX staff will attempt to
contact the member requesting tickets for instructions.  If unable to

4.	All sections of the order form must be completed for processing.  If
the form is not completed correctly, NYMEX staff will attempt to contact the

to contact the requesting party in the event of illegible or incorrect
information on the order form, but if unsuccessful, then the request will be
returned unfilled.

Japan Jan manuf. output seen up 1.4% m/m amd Feb manuf. output forecasted to raise 0.6% m/m. Japan Meti repeated ind output in declining trend. Japan's Lower House budget committee passed a Y2.5 trillion deflation-fighting supplementary budget Monday.The second extra budget for this fiscal is aimed to help finance a Y4.1 trillion spending package and support the economy in the outcome of the Sept. 11 attacks. The budget will also help PM Koizumi to speed up much-needed structural reforms. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, now President of Harvard University told PM Koizumi that he fully supports implementation of structural reforms. Summers spoke with Koizumi about the current situations of the forex markets the world economy.Upside capped at 134.50, 134.90 and 135.30. Support stands at 133.50, 132.80 and 132.40.   The dollar held the European currencies near their 6-month lows, but gave up ground to the yen as a result of the gains in its cross-pairs. As an indication of the dollar's strength, the US Dollar Index soared to 120.35, just shy of its 15-year high of 121, but later eased down to around the 120.0-level.    EUR/USD climbed to 86.10 after plunging to a fresh 6-month low of 85.73 in spite of a better-than-expected rise in the German Ifo business climate indicator that rose to 86.3 in January from an extrapolated reading of 85.8 in December. In response to the third monthly rise in the index, Ifo Chief Nerb commented that German appeared to be in the early stages of a recovery, and urged the European Central Bank to continue to lower interest rates to ensure a recovery. The single currency was likely pressured as well by the rise in M3 to 8% in December, and the gain in the M3 three-month moving average to 7.8% in December from the previous 7.4% and well above the inflation target of 4.5%. Nonetheless, the ECB has tended to brush aside the surges in M3 by explaining them as irregularity, though it does create concern whether upward price pressures will deter the central bank from easing monetary policy. Resistance is viewed at 86.60, 87.0 and 87.50. Support is seen at 85.55-- the 71.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.95, backed by 85.0 and 84.50.   Economists forecasted that tomorrow's release of the Conference Board Consumer Confidence index will rise to 96.9 in January from the previous 93.7, boosted by an increase in consumer expectations. Should the confidence survey surprise even more on the upside, the dollar will likely reap gains from the data that foretells a promising economic outlook.    Other major US data due for release this week include durable goods, real GDP, the FOMC rate decision, jobless claims, employment cost index, personal income and consumption, Chicago Purchasing Managers survey, labor market report, University of Michigan confidence survey, and ISM Purchasing Managers Index.   In addition to President Bush's State of the Union address, tomorrow marks the first day of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting. The majority of analysts have concluded that the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates when the FOMC unveils its decision Wednesday afternoon, especially after Greenspan adjusted his remarks about the economy with a more upbeat tone.  Key Eurozone indicators consist of Italian foreign trade, French INSEE industry survey, Italian PPI, Euroarea retail sales, German CPI, French unemployment, French current account balance, Euroarea manufacturing PMI, Euroarea HICP, balance of payments, German PMI, French PMI, French INSEE household survey, Italian PMI, Italian CPI and Spanish unemployment. Economic data from the UK comprise the Gfk consumer confidence survey and the purchasing managers survey for manufacturing. Highlights from Japan comprise the labor force survey, the household survey of expenditures, industrial production, Shoko Chukin small firm survey and employment survey.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Upbeat manufacturing figures from the Eurozone failed to lift the single currency, but a surge in UK PMI pushed sterling higher across the board. Meanwhile, repatriation fears kept the yen from falling, but this seasonal advantage should give way to further weakness in the weeks ahead.   Today's data from the US is expected to show manufacturing expanded in February for the first time in over 1-1/2 years. The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) closely watched headline index is forecast to rise above the 50-mark, indicating expansion and would add to yesterday's upbeat revision to Q4 GDP which overshot forecasts as it surged to 1.4% q/q from the previous 0.2%, posting its largest gain since Q4 '00.  Traders feel that at some point the good US economic data should push EUR/USD below 86 cents to test previous 6-month low of 85.63. But despite the upbeat forecasts, Enronitis and stock market valuations could keep the dollar under wraps.   Also to be released today is the final reading of February U. Mich sentiment which is expected to rise from the preliminary release of 90.9 to 91.2, but remain below January's 93.0. US income and expenditure growth is expected to continue in January, but at a slower pace.  EUR/USD held steady around 86.80 after Eurozone PMI rose to 48.6 in February, more than the anticipated 47.2 and above a revised 46.3 in January. The data shows an economic recovery is still on the way. However, more hefty gains will be needed to drive the figure above the key 50 mark. In contrast, traders expect to see the US ISM (NAPM) rise today to 50.6 in February from 49.9, putting it back into expansion. Sentiment is mixed however and only a move through 86.30/15 on its way to 85.63 low would put the euro back in full bear mode. Support is seen at 86.30, 86.15, and 85.60. Resistance is viewed at 86.60, 87.10, and 87.85.  Other data showed French consumer confidence took a step backwards in February to minus 15 from minus 12, ending four consecutive months of gains. However, the EUR/USD stayed steady around a day's low of 86.67 after the news. Dealers do not see it as a sign of reversal in the improving trend. Recall that US Conference Board Consumer Confidence tumbled to 94.1 in February from the previous revised 97.8, below forecasts calling for a decline to 96.8.   GBP/USD added to Friday's recovery from an overnight 3-week low of 1.4110 and reached a high of 1.4218 after UK February manufacturing PMI unexpectedly rose above the 50-mark indicating manufacturing has recovered from yearlong contraction. However, sterling is likely to remain weakened by EMU expectations and the fact that BoE Governor George again tried to talk down the currency since sterling strength exacerbates the imbalances the central bank would like to correct. The bank feels a downward correction would help the BoE do its job to get the economy on one track again.  The pound is also likely to remain pressured by selling from traders who had expected that the UK would soon begin to tighten monetary policy, thereby making rates more favorable there than elsewhere among the G7 nations. But it now appears GBP will not benefit from higher interest rates since George clarified that people ""should be careful how much weight they put on the steepness of this curve"", referring to short sterling rate futures. GBP/USD resistance seen at 1.4240. Support at 1.4180. Sterling also rises to day's high of 61.07 pence vs. Euro, thereby not allowing EUR/USD to gain.  USD/JPY encountered further weakness as pressure builds ahead of year end book closings on March 31. Dealers now say that another wave of repatriation could be in store as investors fear a credit crunch at the end of March 31 FY-book closing. Japanese repatriation flows in January brought an enormous 3.3 trillion yen back home. This was a major reason the yen was able to fend off further losses. But with repatriation poised to slow near the end of March and net outward investment to resume thereafter dealers expect to see further yen weakness in the weeks to come allowing USD/JPY to target 140 once the 135.00/20 major resistance band is broken. Upside capped at 133.70, 134.00/10, 134.70/85 and strong resistance at 135.15. Support holds at 133.50, 133.20, 133.0 and 132.50.  Also giving yen support were comments from Japanese Economics Minister Takenaka that it may be necessary to consider taking more steps to further stabilize Japan's financial system before the end of the fiscal year. Takenaka specified that it would intermittently take steps if needed in the run up to the end of the current fiscal year on March 31. However, he did not commit to the injecting of public funds into major commercial banks to help them deal with the massive bad loans on their books. This is seen as a necessary step for Japan to move ahead with reforms.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Protectionism Saps Dollar Strength Despite Invigorating Data  March 6, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8703 $/JPY..132.15 GBP/$..1.4223 $/CHF..1.6975  Protectionism Saps Dollar Strength Despite Invigorating Data by Jes Black  At 10:00:00 AM US Jan Factory Orders (exp 1%, prev 1.2%) At 2:00:00 PM US Feb Fed Beige Book (exp n/f, prev  n/a)  The dollar fell back below 131.80 yen and ceded the 87-cent mark to the euro today as dollar bulls sat on the sidelines despite upbeat economic data. USD resilience in the face of Enronitis and shaky stock market valuations was admirable, but the market has again been pulled down by fears that protectionism will slow the inflow of needed investment capital to the US. Latin American learned the hard way that capital import dependant countries can ill afford protectionist policies.  Therefore, uncertainties related to the imposition of steel imports are likely to have a dampening effect on the dollar. Moreover, a protectionist stance only underscores the competitive problem associated with a strong dollar and is likely to make it more difficult for the greenback to find strength from its upbeat data.  Nevertheless, the recent spate of strong economic reports will keep the dollar resilient. Today's release of the beige book should show further evidence of an improvement in economic conditions. However, like Greenspan's cautiously optimistic speech last week, the overall tone of the report will most likely be guarded as consumer debt and corporate profitability still present downside risks.  Thursday's speech by Greenspan on monetary policy and Friday's key US labor market report will also keep dollar bulls anxiously awaiting further signs of recovery which may pull the greenback out of rangebound trading. But the dollar's recent failure to benefit from strong data and Wall Street's gains has left bulls feeling uncertain. Therefore, currencies continue to trade familiar ranges with trends hard to find.  USD/JPY slipped to a day's low of 131.70 and the renewed break of 131.80 support could lead to a bearish phase after a month long trading range of 131.80 to 135.20.  Given the abundance of negative news from Japan, a rebound back towards 132.50 cannot be ruled out, but a break of 131.50 would speak against it. Upside capped at 132.50, 133.50 and 133.70, 134.00/10, 134.70/85 and strong resistance at 135.15. Support holds at 132.00, 131.80 and 131.50.  Supporting the yen were signs that US fund managers would increase their exposure to Japan just as government officials have created an artificial floor under share prices through stricter short selling laws. Combined with repatriation fears, and the government's resolve to boost Japanese assets ahead of March 31, JPY is likely to fend off the negative news that comes its way.   Case in point was today's announcement from Moody's that there was a  significantly high probability  a current review will lead to a two-notch cut in Japan's rating. Moody's put Japan on review in mid-February and at the time warned that a two-notch cut in the present Aaa3 rating was a risk. However, the decision was not imminent Moody's said. Unconfirmed talk that Japan's state pension fund may be planning to start a huge foreign bond investment plan also kept USD/JPY from slipping below the key 131.80 support, but lack of resolve on the part of dollar bulls kept the pair weak. However, dealers are likely to hold off on further selling and await the market's reaction to Japan's Q4 GDP data due Friday which is again expected to be negative.  EUR/USD hovered around the 87-cent mark but did not show a clear trend for traders. Dealers say only a sustained break above 87.30 or below 86.30 would give a better direction and until then, many are on the sidelines. Holding above 87-cents and taking out 87.35 resistance is now critical for the euro. Failure to maintain above 87 cents could initiate a fall back towards last week's 3-week low of 86.25. A move through 86.30/15 would target its 6-month low of 85.63. But technical indicators are mixed and the steel import debate is likely to intensify, keeping pressure on the dollar. Support is seen at 86.60, 86.30, 86.15, and 85.60. Resistance is viewed at 87.30, and 87.85.  GBP/USD fell to a day's low of 1.4204 from a high of 1.4246 after a strong move in EUR/GBP from trendline support at 61.15 to 61.30 kept sterling under pressure. On Tuesday, cable fell to a day's low of 1.4204 after twice failing to break strong resistance seen at 1.4240. Resistance is eyed at 1.4240, 1.4280 and 1.430. Support holds at 1.4180 and 1.4130.   Both the euro and sterling traded steady against the dollar today ahead of their respective monetary policy meetings on Thursday. Improving economic data and benign inflationary pressures are seen allowing the ECB and BoE to keep rates unchanged at 3.25% and 4.0%. In fact, financial markets are already pricing in a quarter percentage point ECB rate rise by June and BoE Governor George last week had to verbally intervene in the interest rate market to convince futures traders to lower expectations of rate hikes later this year. The German DIW institute head also doesn't expect more ECB rate cuts in this cycle, saying the next move is up instead of down.  The euro was little changed after German data showed industrial orders fell more than expected in January, down -2.1% m/m, well below the -1.4% expected following the previous 4.2% rise. This brought the yearly orders rate down to -5.8% from -5.4%. German unemployment on the other hand stabilized at 9.6% in February.  Meanwhile, USD/CHF is trading at around $1.6970 as markets wait for Thursday's Swiss Q4 GDP figures for more clues about the Swiss National Bank's next likely monetary policy decision on March 21, although no rate change is expected. A Reuters survey projected that Q4 GDP would fall to 0.35% or even as low as -1.5% from the previous quarter's 0.8%, highlighting the weakness in the Swiss economy. Support is seen at 1.6900, backed by the 200-day moving average of 1.6856 and the 1.680-franc figure. Upside capped at 1.7060, 1.710 and 1.7140.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  January 27, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8640 $/JPY..134.80 GBP/$..1.4083 $/CHF..1.7040  Japanese Forex Trading Preview by Darko Pavlovic  No key data.   The dollar remains strong across the board after rising on Friday to a six- month high against the euro and powerful rally vs. the yen, on market confidence the U.S. economy will recover from recession in coming months yen. The yen fell for eighth day in nine on concern reports this week will show Japan's jobless rate rose to a record and consumer spending slowed in December, fueling market perception the economy is worsening. Reports due Tuesday will possibly show Japan's workers' household spending rose 0.9% in December from November, after rising 3.6% in the previous month, and the jobless rate rose to a record of 5.6% On Friday Japan's Vice Economics Minister Kobayashi said that the weaker yen is beneficial for corporate profits. In addition, fears that Japan's sovereign-debt rating will soon be downgraded has convinced most dealers that there is further weakness in store for JPY. Support is seen at 134.0, 133.80 and 133.60. Resistance is seen at 135.00, followed by 135.40 and 136.00.  The euro is trading around 86.40 after falling to a new 6-month low of 86.29 against the dollar amid optimism about the fast US recovery. On Friday, the euro came under heavy downward pressure as news of the monthly increase in Italian inflation stoked fears that the European Central Bank may not be able to cut interest rates in the near future if inflation does not fall below the 2% target level. Based on the preliminary CPI figures from 12 cities, economists forecasted Italian CPI in January would hold steady around 2.3-2.4% y/y from the previous month, but rise to 0.4-0.5% m/m vs. 0.1% in December.   Markets will also look to next week's German CPI data to see whether it confirms an upswing in inflation that may restrain the ECB from easing monetary policy. Economists forecast German CPI will rise to 0.9% m/m from 0.1% in December, and to 2.1% y/y in January vs. the previous 1.7%. Also, German IFO will likely show that business confidence rose in January, adding to expectations Europe's largest economy may recover from recession The Ifo economic is likely to rise to 85.7, from 84.9 in November. Ifo didn't conduct a survey in December. Support is seen at 86.0 and 85.55-- the 71.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.95. Resistance is viewed at 88.15, 88.60 and 89.10-- the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96.  Looking foward to this week, major US data due to be released include new home sales, durable goods, Conference Board Consumer Confidence, real GDP, FOMC rate decision, jobless claims, employment cost index, personal income and consumption, Chicago Purchasing Managers survey, labor market report, University of Michigan confidence survey, and ISM Purchasing Managers Index. Key Eurozone indicators consist of Euroarea M3, German Ifo business climate index, French PPI, Italian foreign trade, French INSEE industry survey, Italian PPI, German CPI, French unemployment, French current account balance, Euroarea manufacturing PMI, Euroarea HICP, Euroarea retail sales, balance of payments, German PMI, French PMI, French INSEE household survey, Italian PMI, Italian CPI and Spanish unemployment. Highlights from Japan comprise the labor force survey, the household survey of expenditures, industrial production, Shoko Chukin small firm survey and employment survey.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

The first piece of data that undermined market's confidence in the dollar was the steepest plunge in durable goods orders in nine months to 8.5% m/m in September from the previous 0.5%. The next key indicator that put further downward pressure on the dollar was the greater-than-expected rise in US jobless claims to 504k from the previous revised 496k. The US 4-week average soared to its highest level since March 1991 to 505k in the week of Oct. 20 from the previous revised 493k. Finally toppling the greenback was the 11.7% fall in US existing home sales to 4.89 mln from the previous 5.5 mln. The National Association of Realtors explained that the largest decline in home sales since April 1995 was due primarily to the September 11 attacks. The ECB decision to hold rates steady at 3.75% disappointed markets as some expected a rate cut due to falling inflation in the Euro-zone. Bundesbank head Welteke explained today's decision that the ECB doubted a marginal rate cut would have any significant economic impact, and noted further that a panic reaction by the ECB would create uncertainty  The single currency earlier shrugged off the rise in Italian consumer confidence to 124.3 in October from the previous 121.2. Nonetheless, the ISAE, who conducted the sentiment survey, said ""unfavorable expectations are emerging on the general economic situation, on unemployment and on intentions to purchase durables"". Initial support is viewed at the 89.0-cent figure, followed by 88.60 and 88.20. Resistance is seen at 89.80, 90.10 and 90.40.  The pound shot up nearly a full cent to a 3-session high of 1.4327 against the dollar on gloomy US economic reports. Markets will tune in to tomorrow's release of Q3 GDP, which is forecasted to grow at 0.4% q/q and 2.0% y/y, indicating that the UK economy is stronger than those of other nations, and the confirmation of such will bolster the pound. Support stands at 1.4230, 1.420 and 1.4160. Upside capped at 1.4330, 1.4350 and 1.4387.  The yen recovered against the dollar after falling to a 11-week low of 123.36 against, due to comments from Japan's Vice Minister for International Affairs Kuroda who said that a yen appreciation would be completely inconsistent with fundamentals, as well as doubts that the Japanese government could cap its new government bond issuances below 30 trln yen by slashing spending in FY 2002 since revenues were declining. The BoJ Governor Hayami said that central bank's policy board outlook and risk assessment of the economy and prices, which are due next Tuesday, will include the fiscal 01 and 02 outlooks. The central bank started releasing six-month outlooks in October 2000. Hayami also noted that Japan is not deflationary spiral but stressed that in order to prevent a prolonged fall in prices the key is boosting private demand and progress in structural reforms. Finance Minister Shiokawa said that in order to keep new issuance of govt. bonds from rising above 30 trln yen there has to be steeper cuts in fiscal 2002 budget. Although the approval rate for PM Koizumi is still holding around 80% the criticism from his own LDP party and dissatisfaction about the proposed economic reforms is raising. Some fraction leaders including ex PM Hashimoto are unhappy with govt. proposed plan to curb bond issuance to 30 trln yen and the way how PM is handling the campaign for structural reforms. Resistance is eyed at 122.90 and 123.35 and 123.65. Support holds at 122.32, 122.0 and 121.60.   The major indicators due from the US this week include new home sales and the final October University of Michigan Confidence Survey, which is forecasted to wane further to 82.7 from the preliminary October reading of 83.4 because of anxieties about the US' economic woes and terrorism.

Sara,

I talked with Brent Hendry late yesterday.  He would like to be e-mailed a form template called ""Credit Review Sheet"" because he is implementing something at his new job similar to what we have.  Who would I call to get such a form?

"America Fights Back - The Latest","To Our Readers:

Here's what's happening today in the war on terrorism and the anthrax
warnings:

Saying the airstrikes have already claimed too many innocent lives, a
group of Afghan exiles hoping to put together a coalition government to
replace the Taliban has appealed to the U.S. to halt its bombing campaign.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/STRIKE_MAIN.html

The head of the Postal Service is asking Americans to be careful opening
their mail, while cautioning that the odds of anthrax contamination are
""very, very slim.""
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/us_anthrax.html

Plus,

The British and Soviet empires came to an end shortly after fighting in
Afghanistan. Could it be the same for America?
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/afghanistan011024.html

The U.S. is under pressure to wrap up attacks before the start of the

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

EUR/USD rose to a day's high of 88.00 but retreated back to a low of 87.41 as offers in the 88.00/10 kept the upside in check. However, GBP/USD continued to forge ahead, breaking key resistance at 1.4235 today, triggering stops on its way to a new two-week high of 1.4285.  Reaction to news that Germany was not formally warned about its budget deficit at today's Ecofin meeting in Brussels was muted, but seen as a positive for the euro. Germany was facing censure for allowing its deficit to come close to the 3% of GDP limit. Nevertheless, underlining today's compromise was the difficulty facing the Eurozone's largest economy caught between the European Central Bank not lowering interest rates and Germany's own brain child -- the Growth and Stability Pact.  Offers at 88.00/10 kept a cap on EUR/USD again today after yesterday's wave of stop-loss buying failed to develop a more sustainable demand for the euro. The single currency still needs to clear 88 cents followed by key resistance at 88.75/80 to remove its bearish outlook. That level marks the 61.8% retracement of this year's high to low of 90.63 to 85.63. Looking forward, unless the single currency can rise above the 88.80-cent level, its momentum should wane and turn back south again. Key support is seen at 87.50 and 87.00.  The euro also reversed course against the pound after a test of 61.95 last Friday was rejected. Today's break below 61.55 support triggered stop loss sales on its way to a low of 61.32. Therefore, renewed pressure on the pair could carry it back towards this month's lows around 60.68 pence. This would cause the euro to give up any further gains on the back of a rise in GBP/USD.  Sterling was little changed by an unexpected jump in UK inflation to a high of 2.6% in January from 1.9% the month before. This was a surprising rise above the Bank of England's target rate of 2.5% so the market will be interested in hearing Wednesday's Bank of England inflation forecast that should provide clues on interest rate hikes later this year. Stronger than expected inflation would lead to further expectations for the UK to be the first major country to raise interest rates this year as the BoE tries to stem debt fueled consumer spending. Markets will also want to know if the bank revises its growth outlook for the UK.  GBP/USD is currently trading above 1.4275, but gains are seen limited to the 1.4335 area, which marks the 61.8% retracement of the move from 1.4515-1.4040 move. Without a break of that level, the pair remains heavy, dealers say. Support seen at previous resistance levels of 1.4235 and 1.4180.  USD/CHF also recovered from an earlier low of 1.6779 reached at the start of European trade, and rebounded to a day's high of 1.6887. The sharp rally ended around resistance at 1.6880. For the near term USD/CHF needs to maintain above 1.6820 to avoid further fall to the 1.6685 area. This level marks the 61.8% retracement of the 1.6350-1.7229 rally, which should hold dealers say. Resistance is seen at 1.6880.  Economic data on Monday showed the Swiss January jobless rate rose to 2.6% from 2.4% in December, as expected. Recent comments from the Swiss National Bank show they are still concerned by the strong Swiss franc against the euro due to the pressure on trade. Blattner also rejected an exchange rate target for Switzerland and stated that the bank should not cut rates to weaken the franc. His comments contrasts with earlier comments from board member Gehrig and SNB president Roth that have singled out the currency as very important to the Swiss economy as well as having expressed concern over the strength of the franc.  There is little in the way of economic data this week until Wednesday. Today's only release is the Richmond Fed survey which is likely to show that manufacturing activity stabilized last month, lending support to recovery being right around the corner.  Despite two consecutive days of gains on Wall Street, the dollar will continue to take its cue from the stock market and today's congressional hearings and the much-anticipated testimony of former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay before the Senate Commerce Committee will take center stage. Lay will take the stand at 9:30 AM EST, but will likely take the fifth to not incriminate himself.  Today's earnings include Applied Materials, BP Amoco, Fox Entertainment and Prudential Financial, Inc.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   2.5%  0.15%  3.75%  4.5%  1.75-2.75%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  October 24, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8934 $/JPY..122.85 GBP/$..1.4282 $/CHF..1.6569  Japanese Forex Trading Preview by Darko Pavlovic  No key data.   The single currency strengthened vs. the dollar amid increased hope that the ECB would cut interest rates at tomorrow's meeting as inflation in Germany continues to fall.Today German Preliminary October CPI fell 0.3% m/m from the previous unchanged, and slipped to 2.0% y/y from the previous 2.1%- to mark its lowest level since August 2000, due to fall in oil prices and fuel. German Preliminary Harmonised CPI was down 0.3% in October vs. the previous unchanged, but held steady at 2.1% y/y. German Chancellor Schroeder asserted there is no economic crisis, and thus no reason to fear a recession, even though the prevailing fear is that Europe is on the brink of a serious downturn.  Today's German inflation data showing the national inflation rate drawing near to the ECB's 2.0% target is seen as improving the possibility the central bank will ease monetary policy in the future, but may not be the deciding factor in tomorrow's decision. In the latest Reuters poll, 27 out of 50 economists anticipate an ECB rate cut tomorrow, an increase from last week's 21. If the central bank fails to deliver a cut, market sentiment suggests the euro will be sold-off on disappointment that the ECB is more interested in falling inflation than to boost the growth. Resistance is seen at 89.44, 89.80 and 90.10. Initial support is viewed at the 89.0-cent figure, followed by 88.60 and 88.20.   The yen was undermined vs. the dollar after Japan's Vice Minister for Int. Affairs Kuroda said that  a yen appreciation would be completely inconsistent with fundamentals  sending Japanese currency to 122.95 but later retrace to around 122.50 levels. Yesterday's release of the Cabinet Office Survey compounded the pessimism, as it showed Japanese consumer confidence tumbled 4 points in September to 36.9 and its lowest level in three years on negative perceptions towards employment and income. The Japanese govt. will spend 350 bln yen of the fiscal 2001 supplementary budget on grants, in order to create more than half a million jobs by March 31, 2005. Japanese Finance Minister Shiokawa called for steeper spending cuts in fiscal year 2002 in order to keep the new issuance of government bonds from rising above 30 trln yen. The leader for New Conservative Party Noda expressed his disagreement with the govt. proposal to issue bonds convertible with state-held shares such as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp and Japan Tobacco. Noda said that the govt. should take aggressive fiscal policy if necessary and not insist on restraining new bond issuance to 30 trln yen. PM Koizumi instructed his govt. to bring forward reform measures such as deregulation. Some analysts think that Koizumi is having problems with the other LDP faction led by former PM Hashimoto who are opposed to reform initiatives and he begins to lose his initial spirit in carrying out the pace and scope of proposed reforms. Resistance is eyed at 123.30, 123.50 and 123.85. Support stands at 122.45, 122.27 and 121.87.  The Fed Beige Book confirmed the US economic activity was debilitated in the period after the terrorist attacks. Especially noteworthy was the Fed's projection that US manufacturing would not turnaround until 2002 because of broad-based weakness, and also due to the longer-term effects on manufacturing from the September 11 attacks. Furthermore, the Fed said that security precautions after the attacks were affecting productivity.  The major indicators due from the US this week include the Employment Cost Index, durable goods, existing and new home sales, and the University of Michigan Confidence Survey. The ECI is forecasted to remain unchanged in Q3 at 0.9%, with slightly higher benefit costs offsetting the marginal decline in wages. However, durable goods are projected to plunge to  1.3% m/m from the previous 0.0%, or plummet to  16.4% y/y from the previous  11.5% as the terrorist attacks compounded the weakness already present in the economy by prompting companies to delay or cancel their purchases. From the Eurozone, key data due for release are German PPI, ISAE Consumer Confidence Survey, Italian Foreign trade, Euroarea M3 data and foreign trade. Markets anxiously await the ECB rate announcement on Thursday October 25. The remaining data release from the UK is the Q3 GDP. Highlights from Japan consist of consumer prices and commercial sales.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Good Afternoon,
	Credit has an issue with Texex Energy Partners that you should be aware of.  We received an amendment of an LC that reduces the coverage amount to $4mm and extends the expiry date to 1/15/02.  It covers physical MTM which we are in the money approx $2mm.  I assume that we are not performing on these contracts (some go out to 6/02), but Texex has not terminated.  I believe we should call Texex to extend the LC to protect the value of these contracts and if they refuse, we terminate and draw on the current LC.  Do you buy into this strategy?  Please advise at your convenience.

Thanks,

Max Sonnonstine

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   2.0%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.75-2.75%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  November 19, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8733 $/JPY..123.07 GBP/$..1.4125 $/CHF..1.6577  Japanese Forex Trading Preview by Darko Pavlovic  No key data.   The dollar advanced to three-month highs vs. the euro, yen, and the pound amid rally in US stocks that signal rebound in the economy and optimism about the anti-terrorist war in Afghanistan. The dollar rose to 123.50 yen, its highest level since August 9 as Japanese currency weakened after the Bank of Japan downgraded its assessment of the economy for the sixth straight month in its November, due to deteriorating consumption, corporate profit, capital spending, employment and income. Thus the BOJ affirmed that ""the adjustment is becoming more severe"", and many economists already expect July-September GDP to confirm the Japanese economy is in a recession. PM Koizumi decided to draw up second supplementary budget for the fiscal 2001 totaling more than 2 trln yen. The second supplementary budget is aimed to boost the ailing economy. Last week Parliament enacted a 3 trln yen budget to increase employment but Koizumi thought that the measure is not enough, as the economy continues to deteriorate. The Ministry of Finance projected that FY02 tax revenue will probably be revised down by Y2.8 trln from Y49.6 trln, thus making it difficult to abide by the 30 trillion yen JGB cap pledged by Prime Minister Koizumi. Index rebalancing by Morgan Stanley (global equities) and JP Morgan (global bonds) are both yen negative which could further hurt the yen to levels above 124 in near future. PM Koizumi's reform plan for highway construction projects triggered opposition from some members of leading LDP party. The issue is sensitive because road construction projects have been on of methods for lawmakers to win votes. If Kouzimi stays determined to reform highway projects about 40% of all projects may have to be cut.   Initial resistance is seen at 123.50, followed by 123.70 and 124.0. Support stands at 123.0, 122.60 and 122.15.   The euro is trading around 87.84  holding above its fresh 3-month low of 87.67after  the Bundesbank's monthly report for November noted German growth was flat in both Q3 and Q2, as many economists foresee a contraction in Q4 because of declining confidence and weak manufacturing. Markets are anxious about Wednesday's German Ifo Business climate index that estimates German growth, which accounts for about one-third of the total Eurozone. Economists forecast the Ifo will remain unchanged at 85 in November after plunging to that level in October from 89.5. Disappointing results will most likely spark renewed selling in the euro. The euro got a brief support from the ECB's Chief Economist Issing who left the door open for future rate cuts by saying there is a good reason to expect Eurozone inflation in 2002 to fall below 2%. His colleague at the European Central Bank Ernest Welteke cheerfully pronounced that the ECB does not see a Eurozone recession in 2001 but rather growth both this year and next.Eurozone Industrial production will likely decline to -1.2% m/m in September from the previous 1.1% or to -1.4% y/y vs. the previous 0.4%. Support is seen at 87.50, 87.20 and 86.80. Upside capped at 88.05, 88.30 and 88.55.   Wednesday's release of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee meeting minutes for the explanation behind the rate cut enacted on November 8, and also for any hints about future decisions. Another significant piece of economic data that is likely to impact the pound's direction is the second release of the UK's GDP for Q3. Support is viewed at 1.410, 1.4075 and 1.4050. Upside capped at 1.4230, 1.4265 and 1.430.  Data due tomorrow from the US include the September trade balance and the index of Leading Indicators. Economists forecast the trade balance will improve to  24.7 billion in September from the previous  27.1 billion, with some estimates indicating an improvement to as much as  15.0 billion as both exports and import levels dropped sharply after the September 11 attacks. Additionally, economists attribute the narrowing trade deficit to the WTC-related reinsurance payments that ebbed as premiums flowed. In a tentative sign of improvement in the US economy, the Index of Leading Indicators is anticipated to rebound in October to positive territory to 0.1% from the previous  0.5%, after posting back-to-back drops. This week's other key US indicators consist of jobless claims and the University of Michigan Confidence survey.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

The Dow sank by 2.8% or 275 points to 9269 and NASDAQ dove 3.9% or 69 points to 1699, as stocks were weighed by Boeing Co. that lost a $200 billion US government contract for fighter planes, fears that Argentina will default on its debt, and on alarm about this week's forthcoming economic reports. Japanese economy was undermined after September unemployment rate rose to a record 5.3%, the biggest increase since March 1967 due to a weak manufacturing and retail sector. From a year earlier spending fell 1.3% the sixth consecutive drop from a year earlier and the propensity to consume ratio dropped 70.3% last month, the lowest level since November 2000. Economic conditions since September 11 has become severe in Japan. The BOJ decided to maintain interest rates near zero and keep a minimum of 6 trillion yen of reserves, while it also revised downwards its growth outlook to a range between -1.6% and -0.6% and its price outlook to a range between -1.3% and -0.9% for the current and next fiscal years because the economy is in a ""severe"" adjustment phase. The BoJ is likely to come under pressure to produce policy that will further ease deflationary pressures and provide a lift to the economy. The BoJ noted that Japan might not recover from present slump until 2003. Finance Minister Shiokawa suggested to the government to formulate a set of criteria which companies have little prospect for recovery and need restructuring. Economy Minister Takenaka said that he expects Japanese economy to contract about 1% in the fiscal year through March, which was in line with private think tanks forecast but worse than what government expect. Support is viewed at 121.50, 121.30 and 120.90. Upside capped at 122.50, 122.80 and 123.10.  The euro rallied two-third cents to reach a new 1-week high of 90.50 against the dollar, boosted by concern about the US economy and remarks from Bundesbank President Welteke that the ECB could cut rates if inflation slowed. In a speech Welteke asserted that ""if, in the Governing Council of the ECB, we see the possibility of reducing interest rates further without compromising price stability, we will do so. Analysts are hopeful the European Central Bank will lower interest rates by at least 25-bp at their monetary policy meeting on November 8 to stimulate flagging European economic growth. Resistance is seen at, 90.85 and 91.15. Support holds at 89.50, 89.20 and 88.90.  The pound soared two-third cents to a 2-week high of 1.4550 against the dollar, uplifted by last week's better-than-expected GDP for Q3 to 0.6% q/q, as well as by speculation of M?flows. News that U.S. financial firm Babcock & Brown may bid for Britain's Railtrack and a weekend newspaper report that German media giant Bertelsmann was looking at Britain's Carlton Communications added to sterling's attractiveness. Resistance is eyed at 1.4575, 1.4590 and 1.4625. Support stands at 1.4430, 1.440 and 1.4340..  This week's economic highlights from the Eurozone comprise France's INSEE industry survey, PPI, CPI, French unemployment, and Euroarea PMI. In a recent Reuters poll, economists forecast Eurozone PMI will fall to 44.5 in October from 45.9 in September, marking the seventh straight month the index has remained below 50 and thereby indicating a contraction in manufacturing. A significant deterioration in the purchasing managers index will reinforce pressure on the European Central Bank to cut interest rates to promote growth in the weakening economies.

"FW: '99 DRCs; Other top Burgundies","

-----Original Message-----

Subject: '99 DRCs; Other top Burgundies


Dear Ms. Sara Shackleton,

'99 DRCs; Other top Burgundies

We have our (extremely tiny) allocation of 1999 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti.
Prices are high (but a good bit less than some we've seen).  I've indicated
the number of bottles available.  These are due in a couple of months.

Plus some other outstanding 1999 Red Burgundies which have just arrived.
All are net priced.  Some (i.e. Mugneret and Pousse d'Or) are even
reasonable.

1. '99 DRC Vosne ""Duvault-Blochet"" (12) $149.99 net
2. '99 DRC Echezeaux (6) $179.99 net
3. '99 DRC Grands Echezeaux (6) $249.99 net
4. '99 DRC Romanee-St.-Vivant (6) $299.99 net
5. '99 DRC Richebourg (6) $399.99 net
6. '99 DRC La Tache (6) $499.99 net
7. '99 DRC Romanee-Conti (3) $2299.99 net

The DRC's director, Aubert de Villaine, considers these among the best wines
he has ever made.  In fact, as Burghound explains, he doesn't think it is
possible to have better grapes than he had in 1999.  These are historic
wines, and the demand for them unprecedented.

8. '99 de Vogue Chambolle-Musigny $59.99 net

Just one case left.  As you probably know, much of this is from very fancy
de-classified fruit.

9. '99 Mugneret Vosne-Romanee $39.99 net
10. '99 Mugneret Nuits ""Chaignots"" $49.99 net

Nobody makes purer, classier or more classic red Burgundies than Mugneret,
and these '99s are just beautiful.  The Nuits ""Chaignots"" is always a
favorite, and this is probably the most delicious I can remember.  And as
Tanzer says, the Vosne-Romanee is ""rich and fine, with lovely fruit and
plaint texture.  This has superb fruit for a village wine.""  These are red
Burgundies for purists, and are still quite affordable given the esteem of
this estate.  (At least they're affordable here; Tanzer prices them at $55
and $80.)

11. '99 Pousse d'Or Santenay ""Clos Tavannes"" $27.99 net
12. '99 Pousse d'Or Volnay ""Clos de l'Audignac"" $39.99 net
13. '99 Pousse d'Or Volnay ""60 Ouvrees"" $44.99 net
14. '99 Pousse d'Or Volnay ""Bousse d'Or"" $49.99 net

1999 is the comeback vintage for this historic estate.  And the prices are
still remarkably reasonable for what's in the bottle.  Burghound (the only
American critic to review them so far, and a quite conservative one) rates
the Santenay ""Clos Tavannes"" 90 points.  It's absolutely delicious.  The
Volnay ""Clos de l'Audignac"" is 89-92: ""positively effusive with its
exquisite nose of sexy, seductive black fruit and perfumed aromatics
followed by sexy, beautifully detailed and rich flavors of juicy, succulent
crushed berries and cassis.  Yet for all the fireworks, it somehow manages
to remain completely Volnay in character.  Lovely stuff.""  If this sounds
good, it is.

And believe it or not, the top two Pousse d'Or monopolies, the famous ""Clos
des Soixante-Ouvrees"" and ""Clos de la Bousse d'Or"" are even better!  Once
again, these superb wines are among Volnay's elite.

The Japanese currency also rose by nearly a full yen to a 3-session high of 116.19 against the euro, in spite of the Bank of Japan's continuing gloomy economic outlook for the second month in a row in February. In its monthly report, the BOJ cited deteriorating labor market conditions and a worsening deflationary spiral as reasons for its pessimism. July-Sept real GDP revised to - 0.5% q/q (vs. prel -0.5%) Japan July Sept capital spending revised to up 1.6% q/q (prel up 1.1%) Japan Jan net foreign bond selling Y3.0712 trln yen (Dec Y827.1 bln selling) Foreigners' Jan net Japan bond selling Y1.2368 trln (Dec Y172.22 blne selling). Separately, a report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said that Standard & Poor's rating agency might change its ratings on Japanese government bonds unless Japan pushes through reform measures or starts exhibiting signs of a rebound. In the coming days, FX traders will be listening for any comments that may emerge from President Bush's trip to Japan on February 17. Nihon Keizai Shimbun survey showed that only balancing economic stimulus pared with structural reforms could bring the country out of recession. Only one out of three Japanese in a survey thinks that PM Koizumi will be able to implement reforms without sacrificing growth, employment. Japan is nervously trying to create the outline of its comprehensive policy remedy to tackle inflation ahead of US President Bush's weekend visit to Japan. ""The problem of deflation is an extremely important issue in structural reform,"" Koizumi said and ""the government and the BOJ must tackle this together."" Nihon Keizai Shimbun survey conducted over the weekend announced that public approval for PM Koizumi plunged to its lowest level of just 55% down 23 points from November due to recent firing of foreign minister Tanaka and prolonged economic slowdown. USD/JPY support is seen at 132.50, 132.20 and 132.0. Resistance is eyed at 134.0, 134.60 and 135.0.  The pound soared nearly a full cent to a 3-week high of 1.4346 against the dollar and climbed one-third pence to a 1-week high of .6111 against the euro, cheered by the larger-than-expected surge in UK RPIX to 2.6% y/y in January from the previous 1.9%, thereby breaking above the Bank of England's 2.5% inflation target. The data suggests that as inflation rises because of strong domestic consumption, the BoE could begin raising interest rates soon since it has the highest rate of growth among all the G7 nations. Thus markets will be interested in seeing the BoE's quarterly inflation report due tomorrow for clues about its next monetary policy decision. The BoE Governor George said that January unexpected jump in inflation was likely  erratic  and it should be around 2.5% Bank's ceiling around two years. His comments could dampen the market expectations of rate rise. George said that he could not say the rate hike is imminent, but he is prepared to lower rates if needed. George also commented that the euro's levels are puzzlingly weak and he believed the single currency would strengthen in near future.   EUR/USD is trading around 87.60 underpinned by relief that Germany was not issued a formal warning about its budget deficit at the Eurozone finance ministers' meeting. Both Germany and Portugal vowed to keep their budget deficits below the EU's 3% of GDP limit. Analysts noted that because of the lack of a reprimand, Germany would not have to slash public spending that would boost growthThe single currency was under slight downward pressure from reports that European telecom Carrier 1 was filing for bankruptcy. Upside capped at 88.0, 88.50 and 89.0. Support holds at 87.0, 86.65 and 86.40.   Tomorrow's release of US retail sales is expected to show a decline to -0.3% in January from the previous -0.1% due to falling auto sales. However, retail sales ex-autos are forecasted to rise to 0.4% in January from -0.1% in December helped by strong general merchandise and apparel sales.  This week's other major US economic releases include retail sales, jobless claims, business inventories, import prices, PPI, industrial production and the University of Michigan confidence survey. Key Eurozone indicators consist of the ECB monthly bulletin, Dutch GDP, French employment, French trade balance, French industrial production and Italian industrial production. Noteworthy UK data releases are the labor market report and the Bank of England inflation forecast. Highlights from Japan comprise GDP, balance of payments, industrial production and Tokyo department store sales.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Jill and Sara,
Here is my proposed letter.  As a matter of course, Jill and I can continue to sign before it goes to commercial.
Please let me know your comments.
Thanks, Sheila

Sara and Marie,
Andy Fastow authorized Ben Glisan and Tim Despain in June to withdraw funds from the Enron Corp Account at MSDW.  

MSDW will accept a letter on company letterhead authorizing individuals to withdraw funds.  I can draft up something and have Andy sign it to authorize for Enron Corp.  We will also include Ben and Tim on the document for signatory examples.

As a matter of course, Jill and I have been signing before it goes to Andy.

Can we do this lettter instead of going the Corporate Secretary route to get it done?  It is not good that we currently have sole reliance on Andy being in the office to move funds out of the account.

Please advise.
Sheila

It is apparent after several conversations last week that we need to come to some agreement on the termination criteria for the financial contracts.  Can we all meet at 11:00 am on the 5th floor in ECS.  I will come back to you all with a room number.

Sara - will you please bring the most recent copy of your list of all counterparties and expected terminations.

Thanks,

Provided, however, that a  clearing member will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the  concurrent position is established the business day prior to the date that the  offset memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing member  filing such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request that the  delay in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the filing of its  clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that a clearing member  files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also files with the clearing  house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest  Report.
 
(2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current  delivery month for energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading on  the third business day, prior to termination of the respective futures contract,  including the termination date.

Provided, however, that a  clearing member will be exempt from this requirement if one side of the  concurrent position is established the business day prior to the date that the  open positions are filed with the Clearing  House.
 
(2) For the purposes of this Rule 4.37A, the current delivery  month for metals futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the tenth  (10th) business day, prior to the first business day of the delivery  month.

EUR/USD fell 1/3 cent from a day's high of 87.40 to a low of 87.11 after trading most of the day in a tight 10 pip range. First to knock the euro was an unexpectedly pessimistic EMU report from Sweden that warned a monetary union area may not become a stable low inflation, low interest rate environment as hoped. Therefore, it is not certain that the euro will be a stable ""hard currency"" area. Moreover, the report highlighted the latent threat of diverging national growth dynamics within the union.  This brings to mind Germany's dilemma of needing a boost from either lower interest rates or higher fiscal spending. But the European Central Bank has been unwilling to lower rates below 3.25% for fear of stoking inflation. Meanwhile, the European Union government would like to censure Germany for irresponsible spending which is pushing their debt levels close to the 3% of GDP limit set out in the Maastrict treaty.   Further weighing on the euro was German Chancellor Schroeder's remark today that his government has not come up with a list of spending cuts or tax hikes to reign in Germany's budget deficit. German states do not want to reduce spending and this now compromises Fin Min Eichel's promise to the EU that the government would bring the budget close to balance by 2004, which was part of the compromise under which Germany avoided an embarrassing censure from the EU this month for its rising deficit. This also suggests that there is no way Eichel's promise can be met and that they may indeed face a fine from the EU this year if their growth projections are too high and revenue therefore too low, which would push the deficit to GDP ratio above the 3% limit.  EUR/USD fell to key support at 87.10 and could threaten the 86.80 level which marks the 50% retracement of the 85.63 to 88.03 move. Follow up support is seen at 86.50 and this month's 6 month low of 85.63. Failure to regain the key 87.40/50 mark will likely keep pressure on the pair after it rebounded from last week's low of 86.80 but met with heavy resistance at 87.46.  GBP/USD also fell to a day's low of 1.4282 after rising to a day's high of 1.4330 but failing to break key resistance around1.4340/50. Sterling also failed to break resistance at the 60.80 pence level against the euro and subsequently fell to a day's low of 61.01. On Thursday, GBP/USD briefly rose to a new 3-week high of 1.4362 following surprisingly upbeat UK jobs data which raised the expectations of the Bank of England raising rates later this year, which tend to benefit sterling. However, 1.4340/50 marks the 61.8% retracement of the move from 1.4515-1.4040 move and has so far provided tough resistance. Without a break of that level, the pair remains heavy, dealers say. Support seen at previous resistance levels of 1.4235 and 1.4180.  USD/CHF rose to a day's high of 1.7004 from a low of 1.6968 after holding above support at 1.6960/50. Resistance is now seen at 1.7055 which marks the 61.8% retracement of the 1.7229-1.6770 move. Support is seen at 1.6960, 1.6890 and 1.6820.  Meanwhile, the yen was little changed today, as the market remained cautious about the direction of USD/JPY after today's comments from Tokyo had little sway in the currency market. At Japan's news conference President Bush and PM Koizumi spoke about the non-performing loan and deflation problems hurting the Japanese economy. But the only movement came after Bush said he and Koizumi had spoken about ""devaluation,"" confusing it with deflation, and sending USD/JPY spiking higher. JPY fell to a day's low of 132.85 against the dollar and 116.00 against the euro following the remarks. But markets quickly adjusted for the gaff and currencies are expected to remain steady today with no key data from the Eurozone and a Federal holiday in the US.  President Bush said he saw signs of a US economic recovery but maintained that Japan needed to stay vigilant about structural reforms. PM Koizumi repeated his pledge to tackle deflation and prevent a financial crisis. He also defended his administration's progress on reform, saying tough measures cannot be completed in only one year.   However, the market was disappointed by Japan's shying away on the injection of public funds into the troubled banking sector. The Nikkei rallied from 18-year lows this month following reassurances from the government that they stood ready to give troubled banks money. But today Japanese ministers again played down the need for any such action saying they saw no risk of a financial crises. Banking analysts were less certain, saying a bailout is inevitable given the precarious position of falling revenues and rising problem loans.  In the meantime, USD/JPY will remain constrained by repatriation flows back to Japan ahead of the March 31 book closing. Afterwards, the yen is likely to come back under pressure as Japan begins to tackle deflation and prevent a financial crisis.  There is no key data from the US today as the market observes a Federal holiday. Trading is expected to be thin.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

It includes a description of the company (but not the name), the % of total tons traded and the credit rating of the counterparty.  Can you let me know if you think this information can be given to a third party under the confidentiality provisions mentioned below?  Please let me know.

Subject:	RE: Forest Products Trading Counterparties

Jennifer,

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the ""Confidentiality"" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") or Enron Canada Corp. (""ECC"").   I was asked to determine if the ""Confidentiality"" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or (b) ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the ""Confidentiality"" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of ""Confidentiality"" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the ""Confidentiality"" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Sorry about the previous attempt.  This is the list of counterparties.  We need to know if we can disclose to third parties that we have traded with them and the volumes associated with the trades.  Thanks for your help.  Call me if you need clarification.

There is confidence the US economy can recover from this terrible third quarter and this is being reflected in US equity market strength and subsequently the dollar. USD hit six-week highs of 88.72 vs. EUR and 1.6674 against CHF in European trade after a sleepy Asian session. The dollar also hit fresh nine-week highs of 1.4201 against sterling and 122.84 yen.  Dealers drove the dollar higher for both domestic and external reasons. Fueling gains at home is the fact that of 225 companies in the S?500 reporting Q3 earnings so far, 85% matched or exceeded projected targets. Therefore, investors are looking ahead to an economic recovery next year and pushing up stocks now. Fears about the war on terrorism and concerns about the current economic environment have been discounted. Case in point: yesterday's surprise announcement of two deceased postal workers who were exposed to anthrax failed to substantially move the dollar lower. For that reason, the risk-aversion problem is fading for the dollar, and USD has now moved beyond September 11 attack levels. In fact, after dealers put fears of war aside they began to reassess relative growth rates amongst the majors and found the US economy to have better long-term prospects.  USD/JPY advanced above its offshore high of 122.60 to a fresh 9-week high of 122.84. Support is seen at 122.60 and the dollar's upswing may intensify should it break 122.80, where stop-loss orders are rumored to be placed. Major technical resistance is seen around 123.25. Weighing on the yen was today's economic data from Japan which showed consumer confidence fell in September fell to 36.9, down four points from June and the weakest reading since 35.2 in September 1998.   Sterling also dipped below yesterday's nine-week low of 1.4215, to a new low of 1.4208. Dealers say comments made by Bank of England member Allsopp that he was concerned by the  four-year long overvaluation of sterling  pressured the pound. Allsopp, who is an external member, said a fall in sterling's value of as much as 10% would be welcome. He also felt UK interest rates should be cut further to tackle a combination of a weakening global economy and a slowdown in UK consumer demand. Minutes of the MPC's September and October meetings, released last week, showed that when the committee voted 7-2 on September 18 for a 25 basis point rate cut, Allsopp was one of two members to vote for a half point cut.   Sterling is now hovering below the 50% Fibonacci retracement of this year's uptrend from around 1.37 to 1.48. If sterling's 6-cent slide in two weeks does not stabilize as investors take profit from the recent sell-off, cable will target 1.4120, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of this year's same uptrend from June. Boding well for the pound is the fact that the Bank of England appears ready to ease monetary policy again in order to bolster economic growth. The decline in September inflation below the 2.5% target will provide the central bank with leeway to cut interest rates again by another 25-bp this year and the BoE's willingness to spur growth (unlike the ECB) will benefit the pound.   EUR/USD came under further pressure on Monday following bearish economic forecasts from Germany's six leading economic institution as well as uninspiring comments from ECB members about the plunge in growth. This stands in sharp contrast with market perception that aggressive fiscal and monetary policy will pay off for investors who bet on the US recovery. Some investors chose not to wait until Thursday's ECB meeting because aside from reassurances that inflation would fall below the targeted 2.0% level by next year, the ECB appears reluctant to give another 25 basis point cut this week. This will likely keep pressure on the euro. However, even if the ECB were to lower rates, the market reaction could be muted because it has already been priced in for some time now. Therefore, the euro again finds itself in a lose/lose situation because the ECB has failed to promote growth. A break of 88.70 sees EUR/USD targeting 88.25/50 area followed by 87.25, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of this year's uptrend from 83.45 to 93.35.  USD/CHF passed yesterday's 6-week high of 1.6640, to reach a fresh high of 1.6680. Gains against the Swiss franc highlighted the fact that the risk premium that investors paid to be in the franc has faded. USD/CHF is now above September 11 attack levels and even though the dollar has corrected against the European currencies it still has more room to rise, especially against the Swiss franc, dealers say. Target is the 1.6735 area. However, any major negative developments for the US, at home or abroad, would quickly translate into gains for the franc  Meanwhile, amid a lack of key data, dealers will await any possible direction Greenspan might give them this week from three scheduled appearances. Greenspan is scheduled to speak today at 8:00 AM at a meeting of the American Bankers' Association in Washington and has other appearances as well on Wednesday and Friday via satellite.   Dealers will also look to see if Wall Street enjoys Tuesday as well as it did yesterday in the face of earnings reports for Q3. So far, of 225 companies in the S?500 reporting Q3 earnings, 85% matched or exceeded projected targets. This has fueled gains in the Dow and Nasdaq and today's futures are up 33 and 9 points respectively.

President Bush this week declared that a new ""axis of evil"" - Iraq, Iran,
and North Korea - pose a deadly and unacceptable threat to the United
States. The statement was a significant expansion of the scope of the war
on terror, but there have been few details about how the United States
will deal with these nations.

targets?

Asian officials raised their concern while PM Koizumi was on a visit with the yen's fall due to fears that it could spark a round of devaluations throughout Asia. In yesterday session, Senior Ministry of Finance official Mizoguchi asserted that FX rates were in line with adjustments in the Japanese economy. Moreover, as Japanese investors prepare to repatriate assets before the end of the fiscal year book closings in March, the yen is likely to appreciate yet again and set off more jawboning to weaken the exchange rate. Separately, US Treasury's O'Neill urged Japan to become a greater contributor to global economic growth, adding that he would discuss the Japanese economic situation in Tokyo next week. The BoJ will end its second day policy meeting but many expect that possible adjustments to market operations would have little effect on currencies. Economic Minister Takenaka and BoJ Governor Hayami are due to speak at a news conference on Wednesday. Japan Dec net foreign bond selling 827.1 bln yen (vs. Nov 573.7 bln yen selling). Foreigners Dec net stocks selling 379.2 bln yen (vs.. Nov 405.6 bln buying) The index for shipments of investment goods fell to a 14-year low in November, due to sluggish shipments of cranes and other types of loading equipment and general machinery. The data indicate a constant decline in capital spending by Japanese manufacturers. Resistance is eyed at 132.0, 132.20 and 132.70. Support holds at 130.80, 130.50 and 130.0.   The euro fell to a 2-week low of 88.27 after the release of the better-than-expected US retail sales data, which rose to 0.1% in December from the previous revised 3.0%. For most of the session, the pair has been hovering around the key 89.10 level, which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. The single currency also dived by more than a whole yen to a 2-week nadir of 115.71 against the Japanese currency. The euro was unable to capitalize on the third consecutive monthly rise in the German ZEW indicator by 3.9 to -83.9, as the ZEW expectations index advanced 10.1 to 35.9. Additionally, the ZEW Eurozone indicator eased by 4.7 to -72.8, while the expectations component improved 12.8 to 43.1. Support is viewed at 88.0, 87.50 and 87.0. Resistance is seen at 89.50, 90.0 and 90.50.  Tomorrow's release of US industrial production is forecasted to return to positive territory for the first time in fourth months to somewhere between 0.0%-0.3% in December from the previous -0.3%. The improvement in industrial production is due to rises in hours worked and increases in auto production, and bodes well for the manufacturing outlook. Capacity utilization is seen to edge up to 74.8% in December from the previous 74.7%. In addition, US CPI data is expected to hold steady at 0.0% in December helped by falling energy prices, as core CPI slips to 0.1% from the previous 0.4% indicating that price pressures remain subdued. Traders will also examine the afternoon release of the Fed Beige Book for its clues about the Fed's economic and monetary policy outlook.   This week's other major indicators from the US consist of jobless claims, housing starts and permit, the Philadelphia Fed survey, international trade, and the University of Michigan confidence survey.Key Eurozone data include German GDP, French current account balance, Italian CPI, Dutch GDP and Italian industrial production. From the UK, traders await the labor market report for further direction on the pound. Highlights from Japan comprise balance of payments, Cabinet Office economy watchers survey, Tokyo department store sales and industrial production.      	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

The yen rose to a one week high vs. the dollar, around 132, boosted by repatriation flows ahead of the end of fiscal year on March 31, and by news that Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi asked his economic ministers to formulate anti-deflation measures prior to President Bush's visit to Japan this weekend. Also lifting the Japanese currency was the rebound in the Nikkei index back above the key 10,000-level. Additionally, the yen was supported by a stronger-than-expected current account surplus that surged 42% from the previous year to 971.8 bln yen in December, arising more from an increase in the income surplus that outpaced its trade surplus. The Financial Services Agency under direction of PM Koizumi will push banks to sell of their bad loans debt to the Resolution and Collection Corp. as a part of 6-point plan to stabilize the financial system. Koizumi's plan to stabilize financial system has two main goals: to improve the balance sheets of major banks through a sweeping disposal of non-performing loans and to stabilize the stock market. USD/JPY support is seen at the 132-yen level, also a double bottom formation, backed by 131.70 and 131.20. Upside capped at 133.0, 133.35/40 and 133.70.  EUR/USD rose to  87.40, boosted by Bank of France Governor Trichet's comments that the euro is currently undervalued. He reiterated that a strong euro is in Europe's interest, and moreover, highlighted signs of recovery present in Europe and the US. Overnight, the single currency had fallen to a 1-week low of 86.80, weighed by an unexpected drop in German retail sales to -3.4% in December from the previous month's 1.6%, or to -4.1% y/y from the previous -0.4%. Separately, the European Central Bank noted nothing new about its inflation or growth outlook, but repeated that interest rates are appropriate to bring inflation below 2% this year. EUR/USD resistance is seen at 87.50, followed by 88.20 and the 200-day moving average at 88.50. Key support holds at 86.80, 86.45/50 the 61.8% retracement of the most recent climb starting on Feb 1 and 85.50.  The first piece of US data to be released tomorrow morning is the Producer Price Index, which is expected to rebound to 0.3% in January from the previous -0.7% on increasing oil and gasoline prices. PPI Ex-Food/Energy is also forecasted to rise to 0.1% in January from the previous -0.1%. The next release will be US industrial production for which analysts project will either hold steady at -0.1% m/m or dip to -0.3% in January because of a decline in hours worked. Manufacturing in most areas is likely to have slowed, with the exception being for high-tech which should rise for the second straight month to 1.0% in January vs. the previous 0.3% as orders accelerate. Finally, the University of Michigan Sentiment survey is anticipated to edge up to 93.4 in the preliminary February reading from the previous 93.0. However, other economists estimate the index will fall to 90.8 because of uncertainty in the stock markets. Therefore, both the current conditions and expectations components of the confidence survey are expected to fall as well.  Key Eurozone indicators consist of German CPI and HICP, French employment, French trade balance, French industrial production and Italian industrial production. The remaining data release from Japan is Tokyo department store sales.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

(exp 0.7%, prev 0.5%) At 2:00:00 PM US Dec Fed. Budget (exp 24 bln, prev -54.3 bln)  The yen crumbled to a new 3-year low of 134.33 after US Treasury Secretary O'Neill refused to engage in a ""weak yen"" debate but agreed that markets should set FX rates. Traders feared O'Neill would show some apprehension as to the yen's sharp slide. Instead, his remarks were seen as still backing the strong dollar policy and taken implicitly that the yen should be allowed to fall. However, O'Neill also pointed out that a competitive devaluation would not fix Japan's non-performing loan problem or improve productivity. Moreover, the US is only likely to support yen weakness if it means Japan forces banks to dump bad loans, accelerates structural reforms and deregulates the markets, like the US has done.  Yet tolerance of a weaker yen is seen giving traders the green light to sell it towards 135 in the near term. USD/JPY rose as high as 134.33 and if the pair can hold above 134.00, technically, the dollar will target 135.00 in the near term. Support is seen at 133.80 followed by 133.30 and 132.80. EUR/JPY also hit a fresh 1-week high of 118.73 after hitting a 7-day low of 115.55 last Tuesday. Support is seen at 118.12, which marks the 61.8% retracement from the January 2 high of 119.71 to last week's low of 115.55. Follow up support is seen around 117.40, 116.50 and 116.00.   The euro/yen cross was bolstered by gains in dollar/yen but the euro continued to show weakness against the dollar after again failing to break resistance at 88.50. EUR/USD rose to a session high of 88.52 but quickly pared those gains and fell back to 88.35. Support is seen at 88.15 followed by 87.90 and key support at 87.50, which marks the 31.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. Resistance is seen at 88.50 followed by 89.10, which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the same move. Yet, only a move back above 89.50 would give any hope of a near term recovery as temporary moves higher are not seen by the market as indicating strength given the euro's difficulty to remain above 90-cents.  Limiting the euro's losses to the dollar were strong gains against the pound following overnight comments from Bank of England Director for Europe, John Townend, who said the pound was clearly overvalued against the euro and would almost certainly need to weaken if the UK were to join the EMU. EUR/GBP rose half a pence to a day's high of 61.90.  However, any artificial lowering of the rate would step up inflationary pressures for the U.K., cautioned Townend, who would like to see EUR/GBP rise, but sterling remain stable vs the dollar. Townend also noted that the U.K. government wont likely assess joining the euro until June 2003.  GBP/USD fell through support at 1.4330 and 1.4300 to a 5-day low of 1.4278. Cable support is now seen at 1.4270, the 61.8% retracement of the move from 1.4060 to 1.4606. Resistance is seen at 1.4300, 1.4330, 1.4350.  For the US session today, earnings will be the focus after traders return from a 3 day weekend. The markets will have to assess over 500 company earnings reports this week, with nearly one in three companies on the S?500 scheduled to report on Tuesday alone. Again, Wall Street is likely to pay more attention to the foreward outlook after already pricing in dismal Q4 figures. Companies due to report are Merck, Motorola, Amazon, Merrill Lynch, Johnson & Johnson, Boeing and Lucent.  Today's key economic data is the leading indicators index for December, which is expected to rise 0.7% after it surprised on the upside last month with a 0.5% gain.  The other main event this week is Fed Chairman Greenspan's speech before the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday. Market sentiment now believes Greenspan probably sounded more pessimistic than he intended in his speech on January 11. Therefore, the market is anticipating a more upbeat tone tomorrow about prospects for economic recovery. Interest rate futures are pricing in less than a 30% chance of a rate cut at the Jan 30 meeting, leaving the majority to believe rates will hold steady at 1.75%, a 40-year low. However, since the dollar index is trading near 6-month highs, most dealers are now divided over whether a further rate cut would help the dollar.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Jay,  Can you send a credit worksheet to Sara for an ISDA for Salt River Project?  

Sara, I am attaching the SRP documents.  

Let me know if you guys need anything else.  What do you think the timing is on getting a credit worksheet together and a review of their docs?

Thanks,

Kim

Kim:

Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

Can you resend the email version which Salt River sent to you?

Jay and/or Tracy:  Who will prepare credit?

Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  JPY Cools on Jawboning, Bewildered USD Awaits Data  March 8, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8783 $/JPY..128.15 GBP/$..1.4253 $/CHF..1.6728  JPY Cools on Jawboning, Bewildered USD Awaits Data by Jes Black  At 8:30:00 AM US Feb Payroll Employment (exp 9k, prev -89k) US Feb Unemployment (exp 5.7%, prev 5.6%) US Feb Avg Hourly Earnings (exp 0.3%, prev 0%) US Feb Avg Work Week (exp 34.2%, prev 34%)  The dollar recovered to back above 128 yen after Thursday's record four-yen decline and rebounded one half cent against the euro from an overnight 6-week low of 88.40. Further gains in the Nikkei today had little effect on the yen and trade was subdued ahead of key US jobs data due at 8:30 AM.   Japanese official, Kuroda, said the Finance Ministry would take action against rapid currency fluctuations. This helped the dollar come off recent lows. However, it lacked urgency as BoJ Governor Hayami said he was not worried about current FX levels. Instead, Hayami gave credit to the recent move as part of the BoJ's monetary policy easing last week. Dealers also suspected the government's top priority is to keep stocks strong ahead of fiscal year-end bookclosings as dealing with a financial crisis would be worse than the effects of a stronger yen.   USD/JPY is now supported at 127.75, which marks the 38.2% retracement of the 115.75-135.15 move provided a solid base for a corrective rally in the pair. However, speculators who had been on the sidelines have poured in to go long the yen. Therefore, USD/JPY could still target 125.28, the 50% retracement of the same move. More importantly, the yen is approaching its 200-day moving average of 125 for the first time since November.  Meanwhile, the government's resolve to boost Japanese assets ahead of March 31 is likely to fend off any negative news that comes its way. Case in point was today's 2% rise in the Nikkei despite Japan's Q4 GDP which fell 1.2% q/q and was the first time in nearly a decade that output had fallen three quarters in a row. The figure attracted little attention and instead, talk of a global recovery has sparked a wave of foreign money coming into Japan as large American banks have announced their repositioning in favor of Japanese shares.  Japanese banks are pinning their hopes on the stock market holding onto recent gains, at least until the end of the fiscal year end on March 31, when they book their massive stockholdings at market value. If players can hold the Nikkei at 12,000, banks could slash latent stock losses by trillions of yen, help improve their capital adequacy ratios and keep them  solvent.    However, this would still not solve their fundamental problems. Therefore, there still remains doubt as to whether the Nikkei can maintain its recent gains after the March 31 fiscal year end and whether the spectacular rise in yen on speculative trading will come undone over the next few weeks. BoJ Governor Hayami alluded to this today when he said he expected the market to be stable through the end of March, but did not say what could happen afterwards.  USD/JPY fell nearly 5% this week alone, while EUR/JPY fell only 3%. This gap has been filled by the 2 cent rise in EUR/USD and supports the notion that rise in the yen is strictly a Japan-driven play rather than a global growth-driven play. The enforcement of anti-short-selling laws in Japan and the rebound in the Nikkei enhances the yen repatriation play.  EUR/USD fell to a day's low of 87.80 as it retreated from an overnight high of 88.40. On Thursday, the market ignored the European Central Bank's decision to keep rates steady at 3.25%. Markets had anticipated the central bank would take no action due to growing signs of Eurozone economic recovery and rising inflationary pressures. But despite the recent rise in EUR/USD, the dollar's weakness is primarily contained to the yen. Nevertheless, the euro is still threatening to take out 88.10 cents, which is the 50% retracement of this year's move 90.63 to 85.63. From there, the euro faces its next resistance at 88.50. Support is viewed at 87.0, backed by 86.65 and 86.30.  The pound was also steady against the dollar around 1.4250 after whipsawing between a 1-1/2 week high of 1.4313 against the dollar, and a 2-session low of 1.4184 cents. Resistance is still seen at 1.4300 and the 200-day moving average of 1.4333, followed by 1.4370 and 1.440. Support holds at 1.420, 1.4170 and 1.4130.  Traders will watch today's US labor report for signs that the recession is taking less of a toll on the workers. The labor market is expected to begin a service production recovery while manufacturing payrolls will continue to contract. US employment labor report is expected to show the creation of 5K to 10K in non-farm payrolls, though some private forecasts expect the creation of 100K. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 5.8% from 5.6%, while average hourly earnings are seen up 0.3% from 0.0%.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

General reluctance to trade in an environment of global uncertainty kept dealers on the sidelines. The dollar is seen on edge before the Wall Street open as investors await another barrage of earnings reports. So far, 25 of the latest 63 earnings results haven't met expectations, and the tech sector is under heavy pressure in Europe today after the Nasdaq dropped 4.4% and the Dow fell 1.61% overnight. Today's economic data may push the dollar to the lower part of its range. Expectations are for US weekly jobless claims to rise 485,000 in the October 13 week, up from 468,000 prior week. Last week was impacted by seasonal data, but as continuing claims surge higher, the unemployment rate is on its way to hitting 5%. The US Philly Fed survey will also be watched because it is seen as an early read on US manufacturing in October. The headline survey is expected to fall to -16.5 from -7.3, and the market will also look to its new orders component, which is seen as a leading indicator.   The dollar steadied on Thursday after an extremely choppy US session overnight, which was provoked by a surge in anxiety following news of more anthrax attacks against the US. Fed Chairman Greenspan tried to calm fears by saying that long-term prospects of the US economy remained bright, but US equity markets were more concerned about the uncertainty of when the US would recover. The White House's Lindsey also said on Wednesday the US will probably see ""small negative"" GDP in Q3, therefore making it likely the US economy will have 2 quarters of negative GDP and officially be in a state of recession. Nevertheless, dealers were quick to push the euro and yen back down amid sentiment that the US would fare better than Japan and the Eurozone because of more fiscal and monetary stimulus in the US.  Indeed that sentiment was reinforced by today's cut in the German growth forecast. FinMin Eichel said Germany's economy was likely to grow by around 0.75% this year and by 1.0-1.5% in 2002. Markets have long been weary about European nation growth forecasts and this week even the European Union warned against what it saw to be over inflated expectations. Therefore, the market has been very reluctant to buy the euro, even amid the US war in Afghanistan (with ground troops now) and increasing occurrences of bio-terrorism on US soil.   The short-term outlook for the euro was not helped by the European Central Bank's bulletin which echoed statements from last Thursday when it kept interest rates on hold. The ECB said that despite the fact that the September 11 attacks could delay a rebound in the euro zone's sluggish economy, it felt that monetary policy was appropriate at the moment. Dealers were less sure, and kept EUR/USD near day lows around 90 cents. EUR/USD hit a session high of 90.40 but remains in its downward channel since peaking at 93.38 on September 17, and was further weakened by its inability to maintain gains above 90.85 last week, which led to a net reduction in long positions. Therefore, the technical outlook for the euro remains bearish as it targets last week's lows of 89.87. Near-term resistance is seen at 90.40 followed by 90.85. Meanwhile, USD/CHF also traded rangebound around the key 1.6400 mark.  The biggest mover was sterling which broke lower out of its consolidation pattern. GBP/USD hit a session low of 1.4423 after testing upside resistance at 1.4500. Cable continues to trade in a range from 1.4400 to 1.4550 since last Thursday. Resistance is now seen at 1.4450, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 1.4395-1.4540. If sterling cannot regain this level, cable is seen targeting 1.4400, the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 1.37 to last Monday's 8-1/2 month high of 1.4836.   Today's mixed retail sales data had little effect on the pound. Monthly retail sales were lower than expected but the August figures were revised up. Retail sales growth is still very strong and this is a positive for sterling because it shows a resilient consumer. And, since the BoE has left the door open for more rate cuts, any fall in consumer confidence would likely be met by further rate cuts, thus supporting sterling.  Meanwhile, USD/JPY traded around the 121 figure. A minor setback in USD/JPY came following comments by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who was reported as saying it was harmful to think a weak yen would solve Japan's economic problems. But, the dollar continues to find support on hopes the U.S. economy will improve in the long term. Today, Finance Minister Shiokawa said he could not assure that the Japanese economy would not contract. But this was not a surprise to the markets considering Japan's GDP fell 0.8 percent in April-June from the previous quarter, and many economists expect full-year contraction for the current fiscal year ending in March 2002. USD/JPY now hovering above support at 120.85 after failing to break resistance around the 122 level on Wednesday. For now, bull trend remains in doubt unless it can regain the 121.00 level. If not, USD/JPY expected to trade in a range of 120 to 122.  European bourses are down around 2% this morning, following techs lower after yesterday's slide in the Nasdaq. The tech sector is under heavy pressure and 4 key tech companies report today. Those are Sun, Ebay and Gateway. But Microsoft's announcement is not seen to be key because the release of Windows XP later this month will put that revenue in next quarter's release. GM's earnings will be watched for a positive surprise considering their large gains in market share through 0% financing in the later part of Q3. The dollar will likely trade around the earnings parade and given strong investor worries about the economic recovery in the US, the dollar will be affected by the direction of US stocks. Other key companies announcing their earnings today are Coke, Merrill, and Boeing.   	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

When Is A Software Invention Actually Ready For Patenting?    The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently affirmed  a District Court decision of patent invalidity under the on-sale  provisions of 35 U.S.C. ?102(b). Robotic Vision Sys.,  Inc. v. View Eng'g, Inc and General Scanning, Inc., 249 F.3d  1307 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The Federal Circuit applied the new two  prong on-sale bar test from Wayne K. Pfaff v. Wells Elecs.,  Inc., 525 U.S. 55 (1998).    In the Pfaff case, the Supreme Court, referred to drawings  and other descriptions of an invention as proof that the invention  is complete and hence ready for patenting. Using the new Pfaff  test, the Federal Circuit held in the Robotic Vision case that a software invention was ready  for patenting when one of the inventors verbally described the invention  to a co-worker in sufficient detail to allow him to practice it,  even though the actual software used to practice the invention  did not exist before the on-sale bar date.    The Robotic Vision case helps illustrate the dynamic nature  of patent law used to protect high-tech inventions. It also illustrates  the caution that must be exercised when attempting to protect  high-tech inventions including methods that are implemented with  software. The conduct of inventors as well as marketing or sales  materials that could describe details of software inventions must  now receive more scrutiny to avoid inadvertent on-sale bars under  ?102(b).

The most market moving remark came from Japanese Finance Minister Shiokawa who said he didn't think the yen was falling too rapidly. This pushed GBP/JPY to a new 30-month high of 192.20 and  EUR/JPY to a 3-week high of 119.15. But movements were contained by Japanese PM Koizumi who said a rapid fall in the yen was unwelcome.  Today's comments differed little from overnight remarks which sent the yen tumbling. Moreover, the market is most interested in the US administration's stance on a strong dollar and a tolerance for a weak yen. Therefore, today's remarks were not seen as stoking the ""weak yen"" fires. O'Neill has tried to play down the FX card by saying the US is only likely to support yen weakness if it means Japan forces banks to dump bad loans, accelerates structural reforms and deregulates the markets, like the US has done. O'Neill also pointed out on Wednesday the need for Japan to open up more markets to foreign competition and for monetary policy to respond to the deflationary crises. Shiokawa agreed with O'Neill's assessment.  Interestingly, EUR/JPY didn't get much of a boost from Wednesday's Financial Times, in which top financial diplomat Kuroda wrote the euro is ""significantly undervalued,"" and that the introduction of euro notes and coins should lead to appreciation of the single currency. EUR/JPY rose to a 3-week high of 119.15 but failed to even test this month's 2-year high of 119.71. Support is seen at 118.65, 118.30 and 118.00.  Kuroda also said Japan, ""needs to tackle structural reform in three areas: in the banking sector, particularly in the disposal of non-performing loans; in deregulation, to spur investment in new business; and in fiscal consolidation.""    Moreover, he discounted recent concerns from Asian neighbors, saying, ""...after the financial crises in the region in 1997-98, most Asian countries have adopted more flexible exchange rate policies and significantly strengthened their foreign reserve positions. Therefore it is highly unlikely that the yen's recent depreciation will have a significantly negative impact on other Asian economies. Neither is it likely to lead to speculative attacks on other Asian currencies.""  GBP/JPY hit a new 30-month high of 192.20 on weak yen sentiment and Japanese fund demand for sterling. However, GBP has had difficulty maintaining above 192 twice this month and it again fell back to a day's low around 191.30. Resistance is seen at 191.50, 191.70 and 192.20. Follow up support is seen at 191.10 and 190.85.  The dollar also had difficulty holding onto gains and its inability to break overnight highs at 134.48 could mean some profit taking is in store for USD/JPY. However, the US administration's tacit approval for a weaker yen will keep pressure on JPY in the near term. Support is seen at 133.80, 133.50, 133.20 and 132.90.  EUR/USD held above 88.50 in European trade after falling from an overnight high of 88.90. Resistance is seen at 89.10-- the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. Failure to regain 89.10 would likely send the pair lower again, testing support at 88.50, then 88.10, 87.70 and key support at 87.50-- the 31.8% Fibonacci retracement of the same move. But only if the pair can maintain above 88.50 and challenge 89.80 would it give any hope of a near term recovery as temporary moves higher are not seen by the market as indicating strength given the euro's difficulty to remain above 90-cents.  The euro also held onto gains against sterling after reaching a 2-week high of 62.13. Again, sterling came under pressure in the aftermath of EMU concerns following Monday night comments from Bank of England Director for Europe, John Townend, who said the pound was clearly overvalued against the euro and would almost certainly need to weaken if the UK were to join the EMU.   GBP/USD also remained under pressure and revisited overnight 1-week lows around 1.4270. Cable upside is seen capped at 1.4330 and 1.4350. Key support is now seen at 1.4270, the 61.8% retracement of the move from 1.4060 to 1.4606. A move below this level could open the pair up to larger losses as the pair targeted 1.4207 and ultimately last November's lows around 1.4060.  The Bank of England kept the door open for further rates cuts when it was revealed today in the minutes that the MPC voted 9-0 to keep rates unchanged at 4.0% in January meeting but also said there may be a case for a rate cut if consumption slows before the global economy recovers. They also said rates would have to rise if consumption fails to slow fast enough but that the risks are evenly balanced, even if the MPC believes consumption is unlikely to slow naturally.  Markets will also pay attention to Thursday's speech by Fed Chairman Greenspan before the Senate Budget Committee at 10:00 AM. Market sentiment now believes Greenspan probably sounded more pessimistic than he intended in his speech on January 11. Therefore, the market is anticipating a more upbeat tone tomorrow about prospects for economic recovery. Interest rate futures are pricing in a 22% chance of a rate cut at the Jan 30 meeting, leaving the majority to believe rates will hold steady at 1.75%, a 40-year low. However, since the dollar index is trading near 6-month highs, most dealers are now divided over whether a further rate cut would help the dollar.  Meanwhile, earnings news will remain the primary focus on Wall Street today, with chain store sales figures expected to hold at 4.3% in January.  Today's companies expected to report gains are Amgen, Boeing, DuPont, Dynegy, Exxon, Merrill Lynch, Pfizer. The major companies expected to report a loss are Broadcom, Coca-Cola Enterprises and Corning. The markets will have to assess over 500 company earnings reports this week, with 2/3 left to report. Wall Street is likely to pay more attention to the forward outlook after already pricing in dismal Q4 figures.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Subject:	CP Contract Information

As we move forward with CPs we need to know weather there is 1-way or 2-way termination payment methodology in the contract.  (Plan is to add a column to our spreadsheet to track this.)  You have mentioned that almost all CPs are 2-way.  What is the best approach to determining which CPs are 1-way versus 2-way?  

Additionally, there is other data we need to complete our spreadsheet, such as:
Contract type (ISDA, GTC, other)
Global contract number
What are your thoughts on getting this information?

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  February 28, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8684 $/JPY..133.45 GBP/$..1.4160 $/CHF..1.6984  Japanese Forex Trading Preview by Darko Pavlovic  At 12:00:00 AM Japan Feb Vehicle Sales (exp n/f, prev n/a)  The dollar fell to a one week low vs. the yen around 133.20 after Japan's January unemployment unexpectedly fell to 5.3%, for the fist time this year. Although positive data give some sign for optimism, the economic outlook still look very depressed. Also, nationwide core CPI fell 0.8% in January from a year earlier, 28th consecutive month of decline, showing that deflation deepens. Tokyo's core consumer prices fell 0.9% from a year ago, worse than economic forecast calling for a fall of 0.1% in January. January Japanese wage earners rose 0.2%, better than markets forecasts which estimated a fall of1.9%. Wage earner spending is an important gauge of personal consumption, which accounts for roughly 55% of Japan's GDP. Overnight, the yen was supported by the Bank of Japan's decision to increase its purchases of government bonds to 1 trillion yen per month from the current 800 billion yen. The central bank's action will help to improve the availability of credit ahead of the fiscal year end in March, although it may weaken the yen in the long run because of the rise in liquidity. Nevertheless, the Japanese currency is likely to depreciate in light of Japan's economic quandary and the government's half-hearted attempt to resolve the floundering economy, evidenced in the anti-deflation package released this week that markets for the most part deem ineffectual. Hayami had clearly indicated his desire that the government would inject funds into the ailing banking sector, but it remains to be seen whether the government will follow up its rhetoric with concrete acts or if their words will be nothing more than empty promises. Support holds at 133.20 and 133.0. Resistance is eyed at 134.0, 134.40 and 134.80.   US preliminary Q4 GDP overshot forecasts as it surged to 1.4% q/q from the previous 0.2%, posting its largest gain since Q4 '00. Meanwhile, US Q4 Final Sales climbed to 3.6% from the previous 2.5%. Among the reasons for the better-than-expected growth figures were significant gains in private and public spending. The greenback also cheered the release of the Chicago PMI that broke above the key 50-level into expansionary territory for the first time in 18 months to 53.1 in February from the previous month's 45.1.   EUR/USD is trading around 86.80 despite being weighed in European trading by the rise in Eurozone HICP to 2.7% y/y in January from the previous 2.5%. The figures prompted economists to expect the European Central Bank will not ease monetary policy when it meets next week, especially after yesterday's data showed that Eurozone M3 climbed to 8%. The single currency also was lifted by the news that Eurozone consumer prices are estimated to have fallen to 2.5% y/y in February compared with the previous 2.7%. German Chancellor Schroeder urged that German wage deals must be economically sensible, noting that a long standoff over wages or strikes would be ""more than problematic"" for recovery. Upside capped at 87.0, 87.40 and 87.80. Support is seen at 86.0, 85.50 and 85.0.   FX traders now await tomorrow's releases of manufacturing and consumer sentiment data for confirmation of the beginning of a turnaround in the US economy. Economists project that the ISM (formerly NAPM) purchasing managers survey for manufacturing will break above the key 50-level for the first time since July 2000 to 50.9 in February from the previous 49.9, confirming today's dramatic improvement in the Chicago PMI. As well, markets will assess the final February reading of the University of Michigan Sentiment survey that is expected to edge up to 91.2 in February from the preliminary estimate of 90.9, but fall compared with the previous month's 93.0.

Nikkei fell yesterday after gaining almost 6% on Monday and traders are waiting for to see the stock performance today, as the rise could strengthen the yen. Nonetheless it is likely that the USD/JPY will hover around 132.50 area. The dollar got support after ISM non-mfg index jumped to its highest levels since November 2000, boosting market expectations for the faster US recovery. Markets ask the govt. to incorporate tax reform into the anti-deflation package that it is expected to strike as early as this month. Many consider the renewal of private demand through tax reform crucial, especially in reducing the corporate and inheritance tax rates. Panelists on the Forum for Policy Innovation would like to see the BoJ placing inflation target as it would force the central bank to rally all kinds of measures at its disposal in order to attain a preset level of price increases. Many government and ruling party officials have hard-pressed the BOJ to set inflation target.Japan's Oct-Dec cap spending fell 14.5% from previous year. Big firms Jan-Mar sentiment index is at  -22.1 (compared with -28.3 for Oct-Dec period)  Oct-Dec current profits down 31.4% y/y. Japanese firms see 01/02 sales down 4.2% y/y Japanese companies Oct-Dec sales down 3.8% y/y Japan firms see 01/02 current profits down 23.2% y/y The lower house will likely pass on Wednesday by a majority vote the 81.23 trillion yen budget for fiscal 2002, clearing the way for final Diet approval before the end of the current fiscal year. Japan's Center for Economic Research announced that GDP grew 1.9% from the preceding month in January, the first positive month-on-month GDP growth in three months due to an increase in consumer spending and exports. Resistance is eyed at 132.70, 133.0 and 133.50. Support stands at 132.0, 131.75 and 131.50.  Today, President Bush announced the decision to levy a 30% tariff on steel imports that portends the start of a trade war. The US explained that the tariffs would be ""temporary safeguard measures"" and would remain in place for three years starting on March 20. Analysts noted that the government was enacting these measures in order to avoid a change in the strong dollar policy and to help the ailing US steel industry in an election year.   EUR/USD is trading around 87.10 after hitting a 1-week high of 87.20, supported by the second consecutive monthly rise in the Eurozone services PMI to 51.1 in February from the prior month's 51.0. In particular, the new business component broke above the key 5-level to 50.6 from 49.7 for the first gain since last summer, thereby spurring hopes that an economic recovery in the Eurozone is imminent. The single currency overlooked a 6,200 count rise in the German unadjusted total to 4.296 mln today, while Euroarea unemployment eased to 8.4% in January. Increasing signs of a turnaround in the Eurozone are thus fueling the prevailing belief that the European Central Bank will keep rates unchanged at 3.25% this Thursday at its monetary policy meeting and may even raise rates later in the year. Resistance is seen at 87.20, 87.40 and 87.80. Support is viewed at 86.30, backed by the 86.0-cent figure, and 85.50.   Major data due from the US this week consist of factory orders, the Fed Beige Book, jobless claims, productivity, consumer credit, and the labor market report. Key Eurozone indicators include German manufacturing orders, German unemployment, ECB rate decision, Italian GDP and Dutch CPI. The main data releases from the UK are the NTC/FRES report on jobs, housing starts and the Bank of England's rate decision. Highlights from Japan comprise the MoF corporate survey, trade balance, indices of business conditions, GDP, money supply and wholesale prices.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the February 2002 options contract for Silver (SO
G2) and Gold (OG G2) is Friday, January 11, 2002.

contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


The following schedule of operational procedures is based on the previously
announced shortened trading hours.

Trading in the February 2002 Silver and Gold Options Contracts will cease at
1:25 P.M. and 1:30 P.M. respectively on January 11, 2002.  All Brokers and
Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions to exercise
or abandon such Options by 3:30 P.M.

On Friday, January 11, 2002, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 4:00 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special ""OLTE"" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:30 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Friday's submissions and processing will be
available on Monday morning January 14, 2002.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
(""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:30 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

A growing sense of dismay with the Japanese outlook prompted traders to poor back into USD/JPY after it fell back to support around 122.40 overnight. The dollar's ability to maintain above 122.00 gave off a strong buy signal, and a break of 123.30 would open the way for a further rally towards 123.70 before 124.30, dealers say. EUR/USD also fell from session highs around 89.40 against the broadly stronger dollar. However, major currencies traded in tight ranges ahead of the key European Central Bank meeting at 7:45 AM. Whether or not they do cut rates today is uncertain and the ECB is well know for wrong-footing the market.  The euro showed little reaction to today's data from the Eurozone as most dealers took to the sidelines ahead of today's ECB meeting. EUR/USD was unchanged after Italian consumer confidence rose in October because the raw data also pointed to a worsening in sentiment following the U.S.-led attacks on Afghanistan. ISAE said in its monthly report that the adjusted index rose to 124.3 this month from 121.2 in September, with confidence particularly strong on prospects for saving. However, ISAE said in a statement that ""unfavourable expectations are emerging on the general economic situation, on unemployment and on intentions to purchase durables"". In the week following the start of the U.S. retaliatory strikes against Afghanistan, which began on October 7, the unadjusted index fell to 118.3. ""That contraction seems to mirror even greater pessimism than that registered immediately after the World Trade Centre attack,"" ISAE said.   Meanwhile, benign German inflation data and dismal business confidence surveys in Italy and Germany raised hopes of a rate cut this week, but uncertainty still prevails. Preliminary data from Germany showed the national inflation rate drawing near to the ECB's 2.0% target. This confirms the downtrend, but it was also expected and may not be enough for the ECB to lower rates since Eurozone inflation for September stood at 2.4%.  The central bank last lowered its benchmark minimum bid rate by 50 basis points to 3.75 percent on September 17, its third easing of monetary policy this year. The rate cut was an effort to restore confidence following the September 11 attacks. A poll conducted by Reuters this week showed that out of 50 economists questioned, 27 now favor a rate cut. Last week, 21 of the same 50 backed a cut. The number expecting no change has also dropped to 18 from 27 last week, putting the chance of a rate cut at 52 percent, up from 48 percent last week.   The euro would likely rally from current levels around 89 cents if the ECB were to cut by 25 basis points. But because a 25 bp cut has already been priced into the market, the prospect for a sustained euro rally is not great. However, a more surprising 50 bp cut would trigger a substantial rise in the euro, possibly above the 90-cent figure. But given the current optimism surrounding the US economy, any gains are likely to be limited unless today's US data disappoints markets. Euro remains in position to test against support at the 50% Fibonacci retracement of 88.40. Current resistance holds at 89.40 if the ECB does not cut rates.  Following this mornings rate announcement by the ECB will be key US economic data which will give a markets a feel for the effect of the September 11 attacks on durable goods orders as well as this week's jobless claims figures. Durable goods orders are expected to show a sharp 1.4% decline in September from last month, bringing the yearly rate down to around  16% after stabilizing in July and August. Further declines are expected in the coming months as consumer and business investment remains poor. Meanwhile, jobless claims are expected to hover around 480 k for the October 20 work week. Home sales are expected to ease back in September after soaring in August and the effects from te attacks are not likely to be felt until later, housing analysts say.   GBP/USD further retrenched in European trade, falling to a session low of 1.4249 from overnight highs around 1.4300. Losses in EUR/USD as well as weakness against the euro weighed on the pound. On Wednesday, Sterling seesawed on a combination of weak economic data followed by supportive comments by UK Minister Peter Hain who said it would be wrong to join the euro at the present time because the UK was better positioned to endure an economic slowdown than Europe. Despite the remark, markets saw little reassurance in the earlier data, which showed business confidence among UK manufacturers plummeted to its lowest in three years in October. This prompted the CBI to call for a 50 bp cut from the Bank of England, the first time in three years the CBI has called for such a large rate cut. GBP/USD is now hovering near support at 1.4255 but the bearish trend is still intact after failing to regain the 1.43 level.  Dealers will also look to earnings reports for Q3. So far, over 3/4 of the companies reporting matched or exceeded projected earnings targets. Today's lineup before the bell are Dow Chemical, Goodyear, and World Com. Those reporting after the bell are Coca-Cola and JDS Uniphase. Both Dow and Nasdaq futures are in negative territory.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Budget  (exp -11 bln, prev  35.4 bln)  The euro came under pressure today following another fall in the key business sentiment survey for Germany. The Ifo business survey fell to an 8-year low of 84.7 in October after plunging in September to 85.0 from 89.5. Since the headline index did not stabilize, it implies that September's steep decline was not just an overreaction to the terrorist attacks on the US and that the economic environment in the Eurozone is actually worse than previously thought. More trouble lies ahead for the Eurozone considering the expectations index fell to 89.6 from a downwardly revised 90.5, meaning that we still have not seen a bottom in the Ifo or the euro.   EUR/USD fell to a session low of 87.81 after the release but held above a 3-month low of 87.67 reached on Monday. The euro has still to test key resistance around 87.45, but with the Eurozone's number one economy now teetering on the edge of a recession, markets are likely to punish the euro again. On Tuesday, the Bundesbank's monthly report for November indicated that Q3 growth was likely to be zero to negative after posting slightly negative growth in Q2 of -0.003%. The Ifo report suggests that Q4 growth will also be negative and that could push Germany into a technical recession. Today's release by the European Union forecasted growth in Germany to stagnate at 0.7% in both 2001 and 2002.  USD/JPY fell to a session low of 122.57 after failing to break key resistance around 123.40 earlier in the day. JPY came under renewed pressure this morning after S?Tokyo Head Chang Yu-Tsung was quoted as saying Japan's sovereign rating could be downgraded again after the S?revised its outlook on Japan's AA rating to ""negative"" in September. However, offers reported around 123.50 kept a cap on the dollar's gains. A fall in EUR/JPY from highs around 108.81 to a session low of 107.74 also gave JPY some strength.   USD/JPY rose to a 3-month high of 123.49 on Monday and has since eased off its highs. But any selling coming ahead of the long holiday weekend should not be enough to offset the overall bullish trend. Sentiment continues to underpin USD because of the renewed momentum in US equities as investors show an increasing appetite for risk. The yen will also stay under pressure from mounting worries about the Japanese banking sector ahead of a slew of earnings reports by major Japanese banks on Thursday. Moreover, with little room for improvement in the Japanese economy until late next year, most market watchers see the yen heading for 125 now that it has successfully breached the 123 mark. Resistance is seen around 123.35/45. But USD/JPY support is expected to hold at 121.95/122.00 followed by 121.40/50, with any pullback towards the latter level seen as a buying opportunity, dealers said.  GBP/USD remained in a tight range of 1.4150 to 1.42. The dollar held sterling's recovery to the 1.42 mark after cable plunged to a 3-month low of 1.4080 on Tuesday morning. Cable was little moved by the fall in EUR/USD as it was offset by a simultaneous fall in EUR/USD. Meanwhile, GBP/USD is still in a bearish trend given its inability to maintain gains above the key technical level of 1.4195.  US Q3 GDP due next Friday is expected to show a decline of 0.9%, but St. Louis Fed President Poole on Tuesday affirmed US economic growth would revive in a matter of months and not years because of low inflation, competitive markets and the combination of Fed and fiscal policy that are supporting the economy. However, Poole cautioned that an exact recovery was uncertain, but that the Fed still has more room to cut US interest rates if needed.  Given the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the US, the Fed's commitment to growth is one of the reason's the dollar has performed well despite the near certainty of a recession. It is also explains why the Morgan Stanley Capital International index is expected to be reweighed in favor of US equities. On the basis of the adjustments MSCI is making, Japan, France and Germany are likely to see the most money leaving their markets, while the UK and US will be the largest beneficiaries.  Today's data from the US is expected to show jobless claims have edged off the 500k pace in October. However, the continuing layoffs is expected to push the final reading of the Univ. of Mich consumer sentiment survey down to 83.0 from 83.5 previously.   	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Due also this week is Bank of Japan's Policy Board meeting on Thursday and US Fed Chairman Greenspan's bi annual speech before Congress on Wednesday. Prime Minister Koizumi is expected to announce his plans to fight deflation on Wednesday, and measures include proposals for the Bank of Japan to add foreign bonds and exchange-traded investment funds to its list of assets for purchase as well as increasing the amount of government bonds it purchases outright.. Should the reform package disappoint markets, the yen is likely to come under renewed downward pressure. It also urged the Resolution and Collection Corp. to increase its purchase of problem loans from banks, calling on the body to draw on the expertise of specialists in the area of corporate rehabilitation and debt appraisal. The RCC needs to upgrade it operations, which now focus too heavily on minimizing possible losses on the loans it acquires, according to the panel. Japan January customs cleared trade balance turned to a surplus of 1881. bln yen after registering a deficit of 95.7 bln yen a year earlier. Japan's surplus with the US, its largest trading partner rose 14.9% y/y to 524.8 bln yen, for the first time in 10 months.Upside capped at 134.50, followed by 134.85 and 135.15. Support holds at 133.20, 133.and132.50.   EUR/USD is trading around 87.50 rising on Friday's better-than-expected Eurozone current account surplus of 2.9 bln euros in December that brought the c/a deficit down to 9.3 bln euros in 2001 from 70.1 bln in 2000. The gain in the current account surplus was offset by a fall in portfolio investment of 11.1 bln euros in December, even though net portfolio flows reached a 40.9 bln euro inflow versus a 102.8 bln outflow in 2000. In a recent Reuters survey, economists forecasted that although Eurozone inflation would fall in February, it would still be above the European Central Bank's 2% ceiling and thus lessen the chances the ECB would lower rates at its next monetary policy meeting on March 7. Eurozone HICP, which is due this Thursday, is estimated to edge down to 2.4% y/y from 2.5% in January. Eventually, analysts foresee the central bank will cut rates when inflation falls lower, possibly by the second quarter of this year. Resistance is seen at 87.85, 88.10 and the 200-day moving average at 88.50. Support is viewed at 86.80, 86.45/50 and 86.10.  Looking forward to this week, key US indicators include existing home sales, Conference Board Consumer Confidence survey, durable goods, new home sales, jobless claims, GDP, Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, personal income and consumption, University of Michigan confidence survey, ISM (formerly NAPM) PMI. In the midst of all the economic releases, markets will be carefully listening to Fed Chairman Greenspan's semi-annual monetary policy testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday for any hint that the central bank may begin to raise interest rates sometime this year. Major data due for release from the Eurozone comprise German PPI, Spanish PPI, German Ifo business climate indicator, French CPI, Italian foreign trade, Euroarea M3, German GDP, French INSEE industry survey, French PPI, Italian retail sales, Belgian CPI, Euroarea HICP, French unemployment, Italy's ISAE industrial confidence survey, Italian PPI, Euroarea manufacturing PMI, Euroarea retail sales, German manufacturing PMI, French manufacturing PMI, France's INSEE household survey, Italian manufacturing PMI, Italian CPI, Italian GDP, and Spanish unemployment.

If you will allow me to quote Sinatra's My Way; ""And now the end is near and so I face the final curtain.""

Just a quick note to let you all know that tomorrow, Thursday, March 7th , will be my last day here at Enron as I move further down the alphabet to a credit role at Entergy Corp.  I will forward my new information as it becomes available but for now - you can reach me at 281-360-6998 (Home Phone) and/or tmoran1961@kingwoodcable.com (Home e-mail)

I wish that it could have been a sweeter ride for all of us but it was not in the cards.  I have enjoyed working with you all and am a better person for the experience.

Best of luck to everybody !
Tom Moran



P.S.
Bonus parting points to anyone that knows who wrote ""My Way""

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the ""Scan Risk"" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 2 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Thursday, January 3, 2001.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN	(1 * $3,500)	=
$3,500
One Short Tier 2 NG or NN	(1 * $3,000)	=		-

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  February 11, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8764 $/JPY..133.35 GBP/$..1.4220 $/CHF..1.6830  Japanese Forex Trading Preview by Darko Pavlovic  No key data  The dollar fell to 133.40 yen from its Friday's highs of 134.70 yen on combination of repatriation from Japanese investors and renewed pessimism about the US fast recovery. As the March 31 approaches, the end of fiscal year, many Japanese investors are repatriating funds home and at this time of year the yen usually strengthens vs. the dollar. Also the yen was supported by remarks from Finance Minister Shiokawa that Japan is considering using 2 trillion yen to buy stocks. Markets are also waiting for U.S. President George W. Bush's visit to Japan on Feb. 17.It is likely that Bush will give support for Koizumi's reforms but also show concern about the weak state of Japanese economy and the pace it is implemented.  Analysts say that speculation that banks will sell their foreign bond holdings to raise funds necessary for bad-loan disposals ahead of the fiscal year-end might help shore up the yen. Finance Minister Shiokawa said Saturday there were no questions or policy requests made of Japan during the meeting of finance ministers and central bankers of the G-7 leading industrial nations. The government and the ruling coalition agreed Monday to increase salaried workers' medical payments to 30%, up from the current 20%, in April 2003. The officials decided to raise the rate of insurance premiums of the government-run health insurance program, designed for workers at smaller firms, to 8.2% from 7.5% on an annual income basis. Nihon Keizai Shimbun survey reported Sunday that listed companies bought back 1.44 billion of their own shares from the beginning of last April through the end of January. The increase is due to a growing number of cross-held shares unloaded mainly by banks and to recover corporate financial indicators intensely watched by investors, such as return on equity and profit per share USD/JPY support is viewed at 133.30, 133.0 and 132.65. Resistance is seen at 134.0, 134.60 and 135.0.  EUR/USD is trading around 87.70 after reaching 2-1/2 week high of 88.01 against the dollar, , lifted by the euro's rise against the Swiss franc following Swiss National Bank board member Niklaus Blattner's remarks that he hoped the euro would rise because the strong Swiss franc remained a concern. Blattner also noted the presence of signs indicative of a Swiss economic recovery in the latter half of the year, and thus said the direction of the next rate move remains open. The single currency was hurt by comments from Austrian Finance Minister Grasser that he supported the European Union's budget warning to Germany since he believed there should not be a distinction between big and small countries under the EU stability pact. The euro could be further undermined tomorrow when the EU finance ministers meet. Markets are speculating whether the EU will issue an official warning to Germany because of its rising deficit approaching near the 3% of GDP limit. In rebuttal, German Finance Minister Eichel vowed today to do everything to avoid a row over a budget warning, and promised to recommit Germany to balancing the budget by 2004 that would require higher growth than currently forecasted. EUR/USD support is seen at 87.0, 86.65 and 86.40. Upside capped at 88.0, 88.50 and 89.0.  This week's major US economic releases include retail sales, jobless claims, business inventories, import prices, PPI, industrial production and the University of Michigan confidence survey. Key Eurozone indicators consist of Spain's labor force survey, Euroarea EcoFin meeting, German foreign trade, Spanish retail sales, ECB monthly bulletin, Dutch GDP, French employment, French trade balance, French industrial production and Italian industrial production. Noteworthy UK data releases are retail prices, labor market report and the Bank of England inflation forecast. Highlights from Japan comprise the Cabinet Office economy watchers survey, GDP, balance of payments, industrial production and Tokyo department store sales.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  January 30, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8611 $/JPY..132.87 GBP/$..1.4143 $/CHF..1.7089  Japanese Forex Trading Preview by Darko Pavlovic  No key data.   The dollar is trading around 132.80 yen, well above one week lows of 132.35 due to strength derived from the upbeat US GDP figure rather than weakness in the Japanese currency. The Japanese currency was supported just before the FOMC decision on news that General Motors' Chief Economist Mustafa Mohatarem had requested the US Treasury tell Japan to stop intervening in currency markets, since the weaker yen is hurting the manufacturing industry and jobs. Overnight the yen had risen to a 1-week high of 132.35 against the dollar after a report in the Wall Street Journal stated that General Motors had complained to Treasury Secretary O'Neill about the weak yen because of its negative impact on the firm's bottom line. GM is hoping that President Bush will discuss the issue when he meets with Prime Minister Koizumi next month, because if the US Treasury does not signal clearly its opposition to Japan's deliberate efforts to weaken the yen, then GM executives fear that the the Japanese will continue their FX manipulations. MoF's Mizoguchi who affirmed Hayami's comment that a weaker currency will not solve Japan's problems also supported the yen. After he sacked Makiko Tanaka as his foreign minister PM Koizumi is trying to appoint Sadako Ogata to that position. The changeover came during busy Japan's diplomatic schedule. The foreign ministers of Japan and Russia are due to meet on Saturday. Koizumi is hopeful Ogata will accept the position.The diffusion index of sales for smaller firms hit -25.9 in January, 2.2 pts better than in December, rising for the first time in six months. Analysts doubtful that improvements in index mean the deteriorating trend have come to a halt. The BoJ policy board member Nakahara reiterated the need for the Central Bank to consider foreign bond buying as a way of injecting liquidity into the financial markets. Nakahara said the BOJ could possibly buy foreign bonds totaling Y200 billion a month.Upside capped at 133.70, 134.0 and 134.30. Support holds at 132.35, 132.0 and 131.75.    The dollar and US stocks rallied today on a better-than-anticipated positive GDP reading, drawing renewed encouragement as well from the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged in a highly expected move.US Q4 GDP rose 0.2% q/q from the previous  1.3%, startling markets which had been expecting a second straight quarterly drop to  1.0% that would have officially designated the US economy as being in a recession. The Federal Reserve decided today to leave interest rates unchanged at 1.75% but maintained its easing bias. The FOMC acknowledged the presence of signs that weakness in demand is abating and economic activity is beginning to firm, thereby leading to a more promising outlook for economic recovery. Tomorrow's release of Chicago PMI is forecasted to rise to 45.5 in January from the previous 41.4, mirroring the improvement seen in the ISM (formerly NAPM) survey. The pickup in the manufacturing sector is attributable to increased spending on durables and other goods, and therefore, US Personal consumption is expected to rise to  0.1% in December from the previous  0.7%. Personal income is also assumed to post a gain of 0.3% in December from the previous  0.1%, even though the Employment cost index is projected to hold steady at 1.0% in Q4.  EUR/USD fell around half-a-cent to a session low of 86.01 in response to the surprisingly positive US GDP data, pressured also by comments from the Bundesbank's Meister declaring that additional ECB rate cuts are pointless if the economy matches the rise in sentiment. He commented that the German economy is now passing its low point and therefore growth will pickup in the latter half of the year. The euro was also hurt by the European Commission's recommendation that Germany and Portugal be warned about their rising budget deficits, which are nearing the official limit of 3% of GDP. Overnight, the single currency was lifted by French business confidence that overshot expectations to rise for the second time to 92 in January from the previous 90. Support is viewed at 85.55-- the 71.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.95, and 85.0. Resistance is seen at 86.70, 87.0 and 87.50.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

     For: Sara Shackleton[IMAGE]   Topics covered: [IMAGE] There Are No Guarantees  [IMAGE] Balancing Risk and Reward  [IMAGE] Investing, Dollar by Dollar  [IMAGE] Putting It All Together      Open an Account Now!    [IMAGE]What is Risk [IMAGE]     Risk is the likelihood that you'll either lose money or earn a lower return than you expect from any investment. To understand more about risk, see ""Understanding risk "".   To gauge your personal risk tolerance, use PlanBuilder  to determine your investing style.      [IMAGE]What is Inflation [IMAGE]     Inflation is the rising costs of goods and services. Over time, inflation makes a dollar able to buy fewer goods and services than it did in the past. For more on the effects of inflation read ""The Impact of Inflation "".     [IMAGE]What If I Had Invested [IMAGE]     Here's an example of how dollar-cost averaging can work. If you had invested a lump sum in the Standard & Poor's 500 index at the start of 1929, months before the start of the Great Depression, by 1938 your investment would have lost about one percent a year. That's ten years when your money would have accomplished absolutely nothing for you. However, if you had spread your dollars into equal quarterly investments through the same period, you would have earned 7.4 percent on average each year.   Try using the ""What If I had Invested"" tool below to experiment with what kind of return you would have made on long-term dollar cost averaging. Try it now!  Enter a stock symbol    Quote Chart SEC Filings What if I had invested... Company Snapshot    [IMAGE]Dollar-Based Investing  [IMAGE]    Dollar-based investing has two main advantages since it allows you to buy fractional shares of stocks: you can invest small amounts in order to purchase stocks whose share prices are high, and you can make sure that all of your investment dollars are put to work when you do make a purchase.    Resources From ShareBuilder Dollar-Based Investing  Asset Allocation with PlanBuilder  Stocks and Index Shares  Closed-end Bond Funds  Get Started with ShareBuilder Sign On to ShareBuilder  Open an Account  Find out how ShareBuilder works  Research a stock  Try PlanBuilder     [IMAGE]    Lesson 1 of 6: Are you ready to start investing in stocks?   by Douglas Gerlach   Are you ready to start investing in stocks? Congratulations. Before you get going, however, there are a few essential concepts you should understand first. Working with these basic concepts is the key to becoming a successful investor. Once you understand the potential risks, rewards, and how to balance your choices in the market, you'll have the right foundation to continue your education and pick stocks for your portfolio.   [IMAGE] There Are No Guarantees  The first thing you need to know about investing is this: Whenever you invest, whether in stocks, bonds, or even if you simply keep your dollars in a money market fund, there is no guarantee you'll make a profit. With some investments, you could even lose money, ending up with less than you started with. Armed with the right knowledge, however, you can improve your odds of success significantly, balancing the risks of investing with the potential rewards.   [IMAGE] Balancing Risk and Reward  Whenever you invest, you expose your money to some level of risk. You might not think about it, but there is risk involved no matter what you do with your money. Most people recognize that stashing their life savings under a mattress or in a cookie jar comes with the risk that their money could be stolen (where do you think burglars look first when they rob a house?) or destroyed (you might be able to find a fire-proof cookie jar, but your bed is definitely not safe in that department).  Investing in the stock market has its own kinds of risks. A stock you purchase might go up or down in price (what's known as ""fluctuation""). Stocks are volatile by their very nature, and that's part of the inherent risk of investing in stocks. In the worst case, a stock could even become worthless and cause you to lose 100% of your investment. However, it's important to recognize that there are different kinds of stocks, and some stocks are riskier than others. You can't ever eliminate the risk associated with investing in stocks-but you can certainly tame it and even put some of those volatile tendencies to work for your benefit.   Keeping Up with Inflation  There is another important kind of risk to consider-- even if you're investing in bonds or just keeping your money in the bank. There's the risk that your investment won't grow fast enough to keep up with the effects of inflation. Over the years, inflation has grown at about three to four percent a year on average. If your money is sitting in a bank collecting interest at less than the rate of inflation, then that money will actually be worth less when you withdraw it at some point down the road.   Not Being Afraid of Risk Whenever you seek higher returns, you must accept higher risk. The key is to balance the amount of risk appropriate for your circumstances (what experts call your risk tolerance) with the amount of reward you want to achieve. Every person has a different tolerance for risk, and it's up to you to decide for yourself how to build a portfolio that will serve you best.  Historically, investing in stocks offers the chance to earn higher returns than investing in bonds or keeping your money in the bank, but that opportunity comes with higher risk. The essence of successful investing, though, is understanding and accepting the fact that risk is unavoidable -- and managing that risk so you can still sleep soundly at night.   [IMAGE]Investing, Dollar by Dollar   An important concept that you can put to work when you use ShareBuilder  to invest in stocks is dollar-cost averaging. While this may sound like some complicated strategy, it's really not so difficult to understand. When you use dollar-cost averaging, you automatically invest a fixed amount each week or month in the purchase of a single security. That's all there is to it!  Why is dollar-cost averaging such a good long-term strategy? Stock prices can be volatile, rising and falling from week to week and month to month. When you make a weekly or monthly purchase, the price of the stock may be higher or lower than it was the month before. If you invest $100 a month, for example, then your $100 will buy fewer shares when the price is high and more shares when the price is low -- automatically. While dollar-cost averaging doesn't assure a profit, over time the average cost of your shares will generally tend to be lower than if you had made a single one-time investment of the same amount.   You might be using dollar-cost averaging right now without even knowing it. If you invest in a 401(k) or other retirement plan at work, you contribute a fixed amount each pay period to your account, which is then used to buy shares in one or more mutual funds. Over time, your regular purchases will probably reduce the average cost you pay for all your shares -- and that can help increase your returns.   You should recognize that dollar-cost averaging doesn't protect you from investment losses. And a stock can decline until it's worthless -- so don't count on dollar-cost averaging to protect you from the damage caused by buying a bad stock.  ShareBuilder is designed to make dollar-cost averaging easy by allowing you to buy in dollar amounts - dollar-based investing. When you buy stocks at a typical brokerage, you can only buy whole shares. If your chosen stock sells for $70 a share, and you have $200 to invest, then you can only buy two shares for $140 (plus commissions). The remaining $60 has to sit on the sidelines until the next month (which means it can't be working for you in your portfolio).   If you have $50 a month to invest at a typical brokerage, and the stock you've selected currently sells for $85 a share, what do you do? Either you wait until you scrape together the remaining $35 (and hope the price doesn't go higher), or you find another stock.  With ShareBuilder, dollar-based investing means you can purchase fractional shares with the entire amount of your investment dollars. Your $200 will buy you 2.857 shares of your $70 stock (without commissions). Or your $50 will buy you 0.588 shares of your $85 stock, so you don't have to put off investing until tomorrow.   [IMAGE] Putting It All Together  Understanding these three basic concepts is key to becoming a successful investor.   You must be aware of the risks of investing. Understand how you can use strategies like dollar- cost averaging to invest in stocks. If you invest with your eye on the long-term, you can often ride out bumpy times in the market.

The yen ceded two-third yen to bottom at a 1-week low of 132.60 against the dollar and EUR/JPY rose to a session high of 116.79yen. On Friday, markets will scrutinize speeches of several government officials that will likely influence the USD/JPY levels at the end of the week. Due to speak are: PM Koizumi, BoJ Governor Hayami, Finance Minister Shiokawa and Economic Minister Takenaka. The yen got support after Vice Minister for International Affairs Kuroda's stated that Japan has no intention to weaken the yen, but rather upholds the view that FX rates should reflect fundamentals. Thus Kuroda explained that it was inevitable for a currency to fall if the economy was weak. Separately, markets are anxious to hear any comments that may emerge from US Treasury Secretary O'Neill's visit to Japan. The Financial Services Agency announced that a record of 46 small banks and credit cooperatives went bankrupt last year due largely to strict inspections A total of nine banks and 37 credit cooperatives accounts for 15% of Japan's total credit cooperatives. PM Koizumi hinted Thursday the government could alter the current taxation base for corporate and individual income taxes as a part of his structural reform initiatives. Koizumi added that reforming the tax system is a key element of his structural reform plans. The Nippon Research Institute said Thursday its consumer sentiment index, an index on prospective living conditions in the coming year, deteriorated further in December to a record high of 158, up 5 points from October. A higher reading indicates bigger concern among consumers about their situation. Resistance is eyed at 132.70, 133.0 and 133.35. Support holds at 131.80, 131.60 and 131.30.   EUR/USD is trading around 88.12 marking the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96 in today's US session.  The single currency fell in the European session to a 3-week low of 87.92 cents after German GDP posted a fall of 0.6% in 2001 vs. the previous year's 3% growth rate. In addition, the single currency was pressured by market speculation that the EU would warn Germany and Portugal about their budget deficits rising towards the 3% of GDP limit, in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty. In particular, Germany is feeling the effect of falling growth and tax revenues along with the need to increase spending to address unemployment. German Finance Minister Eichel estimates the budget will comprise 2.5% of GDP this year, in contrast with research institutes that predict a range between 2.7-3.0%.Support is viewed at 88.0, 87.50 and 87.0. Resistance is seen at 88.50 and 90.0  Tomorrow's US International Trade balance is expected to ease to -29.0 billion in November from the previous -29.4 bln due to a deceleration in both imports and exports as a consequence of the global slowdown. The University of Michigan confidence survey is forecasted to rise to 89.3 in the preliminary January reading from the previous 88.8. Consequently the dollar is likely to find support as long as the data meets or exceeds expectations. Finally, currency markets will be carefully monitoring tomorrow's meeting between representatives of the National Association of Manufacturers and the US Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs Taylor to discuss the repercussions of the strong dollar policy. Last week NAM Vice President Vargo requested a meeting with the US Treasury to complain that the strong dollar policy is hurting the exports and slowing down the recovery of the US economy. Vargo thinks that the dollar is currently overvalued because of its strength against the major currencies in spite of the US slowdown.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England are expected to hold rates unchanged at 3.25% and 4.0% respectively. Meanwhile, traders will continue to look to Wall Street for direction in the dollar as caution has again taken hold. Market expectations for a rebound in earnings are still seen by many as too optimistic. Therefore, the upside in the dollar is dependant on real economic growth while there is always a risk of a downward surprise.  Notably, the dollar failed to capitalize on stronger than expected productivity data on Wednesday as Wall Street came under increasing pressure in the face of investor caution. US stocks finished down after accounting worries, jitters over earnings warnings, and a murky outlook offset a 3.5% rise in Q4 US productivity. The Dow slid 32 points to 9653 and NASDAQ fell 25 points to 1812. Today's futures are unchanged. Company earnings reports include ALLIANZ AG, British Telecommunications PLC, MCI Group, Novartis AG, PepsiAmericas, Royal Dutch Petroleum and WorldCom Inc.-WorldCom Group.  The euro was little changed on the day except for a half cent spike higher after ECB President Duisenberg announced that he would retire in July 2003. Traders reacted favorably for the euro because there has been criticism on how the ECB sets its policy as well as the ECB President himself. Other ECB officials were quick to give their support for Duisenberg's decision and Italy's Tremonti says he thinks highly of BoF Governor Trichet as a person. His comment is seen solidifying the unity the ECB has for Trichet as a successor to Duisenberg.  The ECB is likely to cite inflationary concerns in January as preventing it from lowering rates this month. But markets are unlikely to react favorably to the ECB's decision due to the subdued outlook for growth this year.  The European Commission today said it forecast eurozone GDP will accelerate by anything between 0.1 and 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2002 compared with the previous quarter. For the last quarter of 2001, today's data confirmed a small 0.1% rise q/q.  It would imply that the trough of the recent slowdown is situated in the last quarter of 2001, but also that activity will only moderately accelerate at the beginning of this year,"" the European Commission said in a statement.  As expected, the Bank of England held rates unchanged at 4.0%. Strong consumer spending and a boom in the housing market are offsetting the recession prone manufacturing industry. The net effect is for a relatively healthy economy. But markets may question why the Bank of England today decided to keep rates unchanged. With low inflation and the highest interest rates of either the US or the ECB, manufacturers are likely voice their discontent. However, the BoE is seen wanting to curb domestic demand to avoid a boom/bust cycle in consumer spending.   EUR/USD was little changed from its US close after a sharp rebound from a low of 86.45 to a day's high of 86.92 after Duisenberg's announcement. But the euro failed to rise above the psychological 87-cent mark and is again trading in a range of 86.50 to 86.80. Failure to regain resistance at 86.80 is seen calling upon support at 86.35 and 86.00, before another attempt at 86.60. Resistance is seen at 87.10, which marks the 38.2% retracement of the .8953-.8560 move. A rise above that level would target the key 87.50 mark and a breach of this level would be bullish for the EUR/USD. However, only a move above past resistance at 88.60 would really damage the bear trend.  GBP/USD fell to a day's low of 1.4085 after breaking support at 1.4115. Cable peaked at a 1-week high of 1.4247 in European trade on Tuesday. But failure to maintain above 1.4110 would call upon key support at 1.4180, which marks the 38.2% retracement of the 1.4418-1.4038 move. Follow up support is seen at last week's 6-month lows of 1.4045. Upside capped at 1.4235, 1.4270 and 1.4300.  Meanwhile, the Swiss franc is likely to remain under pressure against the dollar and euro after the Swiss KoF institute said today that their Q401 survey shows the economy will continue to slow in Q102 and not reach bottom until the end of H1.   Today's data from the US is expected to show another fall in jobless claims to 380k this week from 390k the previous. This will likely keep the 4-week average below 400k for a second week which is a clear sign of improving labor market conditions.  USD/JPY rose to a session high of 134.15 but dealers are likely to remain weary about pushing it beyond the 135 mark give recent comments from Japan's top financial diplomat, Kuroda, that Japan was comfortable with a range of 130-135, for now. Kuroda also said that rapid foreign exchange movements are undesirable. Therefore, given this weekend's G7 meeting, the yen is likely to remain in a tight range against the dollar.   Meanwhile, all eyes are on Friday's monetary policy meeting in Japan. Given the resurging pessimism surrounding the Japanese economy, there is a chance the Bank of Japan will take additional easing steps to stop the deflationary trend that menaces the economy.  In order to curb the sharp rise in Japanese Government Bonds, the Bank of Japan might surprise markets and increase the outright purchases of JGBs at Friday's policy meeting. Currently they purchase 800 billion worth of JGBs per month and may decide to increase this by 10-25% to around 1 trillion in an effort to increase liquidity and stabilize bond yields. The move would likely weaken the yen.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

[IMAGE] Forums Discuss these points in the Forums:  Forexnews Forum       Technicals Live Charts Analysis available from: Cornelius Luca   J.P. Chorek   Technical Research Ltd.   Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   2.0%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.75-2.75%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  November 20, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8832 $/JPY..122.62 GBP/$..1.4197 $/CHF..1.6483  Japanese Forex Trading Preview by Darko Pavlovic  At 6:50:00 AM Japan Sept Index of Tertiary sector activity (exp -0.5, prev -0.1)  The euro rose to a session high of $0.8842 vs. the dollar, as the dealers sold the greenback on profit-taking ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. The single currency was boosted overnight as Chinese officials confirmed it would increase its allocation of euros in its foreign currency reserves. Vice Governor of the People's Bank of China Guo Shuqing said China had purchased euros in the last two months and would continue its buying. Dealers speculated that China would shift possible 10% of its reserves into the euro, in a move that would translate to around 20 billion euros. Markets await tomorrow's release of the German Ifo Business climate index that estimates German growth, which accounts for about one-third of the total Eurozone. Economists forecast the Ifo will remain unchanged at 85 in November after plunging to that level in October from 89.5. Disappointing results will most likely spark renewed selling in the euro. Traders are also on edge ahead of Thursday's Euroarea GDP figures for Q3, which are seen to edge up to 0.2% from the previous quarter's 0.1%, as Italy posted a slight increase in GDP growth. However, France and Germany are both expected to show stagnant growth at 0.3% and 0.0% in Q3. The EU Commission forecasted Eurozone GDP at 1.6% in 2001 and at 1.3% in 2002. French Finance Minister Fabius was more optimistic in his outlook, anticipating French growth around 2% this year. Support is viewed at the 88.0-cent figure, backed by 87.80 and 87.40. Resistance is seen at 88.55, 88.75 and 89.10.  The yen recovered to 122.54 vs. the dollar, as the greenback slipped from three-month highs around 123.52 yen. Japan July- September economic activity fell 1.7% from the previous quarter and Japan July- September tertiary sector index fell 1% on quarter. In September the all industries index down 0.8% from the previous month, and tertiary sector index fell 0.9%. The deterioration in Japanese spending has negatively impacted manufacturing production, corporate profit, capital spending, employment and income, and thus leads many economists to expect the July-September GDP will confirm the Japanese economy is in a recession. PM Koizumi wants to reform public corporations for highway construction. He showed determination in integrating and privatizing four highway construction entities and in eliminating the Housing Loan Corp. His proposal met a fierce opposition in some LDP lawmakers as construction of highways has always been a good investment for attracting more votes, but some lawmakers appear to seek a compromise behind the scene due to PM popularity. The Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy decided Tuesday that the government and the Bank of Japan would meet often to generate a synchronized anti-deflationary policy frame. By holding habitual talks, the panel aspires to produce an atmosphere that facilitates the government and the BOJ to direct in executing anti-deflationary policy measures. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported Tuesday that, a government deregulation panel would propose in a draft report due in December further deregulation of the job placement. A second supplementary budget for fiscal 2001 would focus on urban renewal. The government plans to decide the draw of the package on Nov. 30. A major obstacle for the government is how to raise the 2-3 trillion yen without exceeding the government's promise to keep new government bond issuance under 30 trillion yen. Japan's Center for Economic Research forecasted real July-September GDP  to have contracted 0.3%, or 1.4% annualized, from the previous quarter, for the second consecutive quarter of decline. The OECD forecasted Japanese economy will contract until 2003 and the recession could get deeper if the government does not fully implement bad loans disposal.  Senior officials of the ruling LDP asked Koizumi to take their views into consideration when deciding policies. Support is viewed at 122.50, 122.20 and 122.0. Upside capped at 123.25, 123.50 and 123.85.  This week's remaining major economic indicator from the US is the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Survey that likely slipped to 83.0 in the final November reading from the preliminary 83.5 as layoff announcements offset any gains from improved sentiment arising from the military success in Afghanistan and hopes for an economic recovery. From the Eurozone, economic highlights include German CPI, German Ifo business climate index, German GDP, German PPI, German import prices, French GDP, and Italy's ISAE business confidence survey. Japanese data due for release are the trade balance and the index of tertiary sector activity. Economic releases from the UK comprise the CBI Industrial Trends Survey and Q3 GDP.

If the yen breaks below 130-which are the lows from January 7th, it could strengthen vs. the dollar to 129.30-129. Moody's rating agency announced that there was a high probability that a new review would prompt a two-notch ratings downgrade in Japan's sovereign debt. Traders also wait for the release of Q4 GDP data from Japan on Friday. The ruling LDP party is advocating the government to compile new stimulus measures, as a way to help the economic recovery. After the fall in PM Koizumi's popularity it is more obvious that the ruling coalition is trying to impose its decisions on they way how the government should deal with economic problems. Economic minister Tanaka and BoJ Governor Hayami do not agree if inflation target should be set. Tanaka is in favor of inflation targeting while Hayami thinks that its impact would be very limited on monetary policy. The House of Representatives passed the 81.23 trillion yen budget for fiscal 2002, which begins April 1. The total amount of the budget fell 1.7% from fiscal 2001 and is the smallest since that for fiscal 1998. The budget was submitted to the Diet on Jan. 25.Ten major think tanks downgraded their GDP growth rate for the October-December 2001 quarter. The contraction in GDP forecasted by the institutions averages 1.3% below the previous quarter, which converts into an annualized contraction rate of 5.2% and would mark the third straight quarter-on-quarter decline. The revisions were due to fall in corporate capital spending data for the same quarter. Japan foreign reserves rose $403.486 bln at end February up $2.609 bln from a month earlier. A breach of 130.50 should trigger the testing of the trend support line, which extends from 115.75 (Sep 20) thru 119.71 (Nov 12), at the 129.75 level. Resistance is seen at 132.50, 133.50 and 133.70.  EUR/USD is trading around 87.65 waiting for tomorrow's rate announcement from the European Central Bank, even though analysts do not expect a rate move. Having broken the near-term resistance of 87.55, EUR/USD will eye the more challenging target of 88.10 cents, which is the 50% retracement of the slide from the year's high of 90.63 to the year's low of 85.63. From there, the euro faces its next resistance at 88.50. Support is viewed at 87.0, backed by 86.65 and 86.30.   The majority of economists believe that the BoE will keep rates steady at 4.0%, particularly after the central bank governor Eddie George made comments with the intent of dampening market hopes for interest rate hikes later in the year. Sterling tumbled against the euro, though, on reports of an impending deal between the UK's Imperial Tobacco and Germany's Reemtsma. Cable is trading around $1.4230. Support holds at 1.420, 1.4170 and 1.4130. Upside capped at 1.4256, 1.4280 and 1.430.  Tomorrow's release of US Q4 productivity is forecasted to rise to 4.5% from the previous quarter's 3.5% due to an upward revision in GDP. This is a dollar supportive piece of data, though markets will still be waiting for Friday's labor market report for a reading on the US economy.  Major data due from the US this week consist of jobless claims, productivity, consumer credit, and the labor market report. Key Eurozone indicators include the ECB rate decision, Italian GDP and Dutch CPI. The main data releases from the UK are housing starts and the Bank of England's rate decision. Highlights from Japan comprise the MoF corporate survey, trade balance, indices of business conditions, GDP, money supply and wholesale prices.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Dollar seem well supported around 132.60 yen, waiting for official comments from US Treasury Secretary O'Neill who will meet Japanese officials on Monday to talk about the USD/JPY directions. In the past three months the yen fell around 9% vs. the dollar making Japanese currency more competitive abroad. A strong dollar policy prompted talks between representatives of the National Association of Manufacturers and the US Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs Taylor on Friday. Prior to his meeting with NAM representatives, Undersecretary Taylor reiterated that O'Neill still believes in the strong dollar policy. Taylor said he would listen to their view on the economy, which he forecasted would grow at a rate around 3% by the end of the year, thus marking a ""pretty good recovery"". On Friday Bank of Japan Governor Hayami said that that it was important to maintain strong currency, adding that there is no central bank, which would like to see its currency decline. In contrast, Finance Minister Shiokawa said that  the value of the yen is decided by market movements  suggesting that the government is happy with the current currency's level. Economic Minister Takenaka said that yen's recent fall was natural taken into consideration weak economy and central bank's monetary easing. Support is seen at 132.0, 131.80 and 131.60. Resistance is eyed at 133.0 and 133.35.  EUR/USD is trading around 88.50 unchanged from Friday, as EUR/JPY also climbed nearly two-third yen to a 3-session high of 117.38. On Friday, the single currency had been weighed by the largest monthly drop in 9 years in Italian industrial production of 2.6% m/m or 5.7% y/y that prompted Italy's ISAE to gloomily remark that it foresaw preliminary Q1 2002 industrial output being ""stagnant"" and in line with Q4 2001. The EU's statement that Eurozone GDP for 2001 could have fallen to a level between -0.3% and 0.1% also lent to the gloom hitting the euro. Resistance is seen at 88.80, 89.50 and 90.0. Support is viewed at 88.0, 87.50 and 87.0.  Looking ahead to this week, key US indicators include the Index of Leading Indicators, jobless claims and existing home sales. Fed Chairman Greenspan's testimony before the Senate Budget Committee will be the major event of the week, with markets cautious to hear his remarks on the economy. From the Eurozone, major data due for release consist of Euroarea foreign trade, Euroarea industrial production, HICP, French CPI, Italian industrial orders, Euroarea labor costs, German CPI, Italy's ISAE consumer confidence survey, ECB monthly bulletin, German PPI, Italian CPI, Italy's ISAE industrial confidence survey, Italian retail sales and Spanish PPI. Economic highlights from Japan comprise the trade balance, index of tertiary sector activity, corporate service prices and consumer prices.   The ministerial conference on Afghan reconstruction opening Monday in Tokyo is expected to goes through a three-phase rebuilding process and a promise of total financial assistance of about 2.5-3.0 billion dollars over the next two-and-a-half years. Japan promised to donate around 500 mln dollars.      	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Meanwhile, the yen was little changed from the Bank of Japan's decision to increase its outright JGB purchases to one trillion yen a month from 800 billion, but it did fall in afternoon London trade as dealers saw little hope in the anti-reform package presented overnight.   Today's economic data is expected to underpin Greenspan's outlook. Markets expect a healthy revision to Q4 '01 GDP to 0.8%-1.0% from the advanced reading of 0.2%. Stronger spending and a fall in the trade deficit are credited for the increased optimism. Later in the morning, traders will assess the Chicago PMI for insight to the ISM's PMI on Friday. Chicago PMI is forecasted to rise to 47.7 in February compared with the previous month's 45.1 as conditions in the Midwest manufacturing region continue to improve. Weekly jobless claims are expected to decline to 370k from 383k.  Despite the upbeat forecasts, today's Enron hearings could keep the dollar under wraps as investors continue to look at stock market valuations with skepticism.    Data from the Eurozone showed a jump in CPI to 2.7% in January from 2.7%. This was slightly higher than the 2.6% forecasted. Economists expect the figures to keep interest rate policy steady at the European Central Bank, which holds its next rate review meeting next week. Supporting this view was evidence that Eurozone M3 rose on a 3-month basis to a high of 8% from 7.8%. The ECB also watches M3 as part of their inflation outlook, but has long said M3 poses no real price risks.   Recent comments suggest we are likely to see steady monetary policy from the Fed, ECB and BoE for some time to come. At next week's Fed meeting, Greenspan is likely to keep the easing bias to avoid the problem BoE Governor George ran into with markets driving yields higher on overzealous expectations of rate hikes.  EUR/USD maintained in a tight range around 86.40 after dropping overnight to a 3-week low of 86.27 before again testing resistance around 86.60 in today's session. Sentiment is again turning bearish, but only a move through 86.30/15 on its way to 85.63 low would put the euro back in full bear mode. Support is seen at 86.30, 86.15, and 85.60. Resistance is viewed at 86.60, 87.10, and 87.85.  GBP/USD broke below support at 1.4180 after and revisted an overnight 2-week low around 1.4150 after BoE Governor George today tried again to talk down the currency. George said sterling strength exacerbates the imbalances the central bank would like to correct. Therefore, a fall would help the BoE do its job to get the economy on one track again.  Usually central bankers like a strong currency because it allows for lower interest rates and flexibility on monetary policy. But with RPIX running near their target of 2.5%, George appears more concerned with the UK's two-speed economy. He repeated that ""unbalanced growth better than no growth"" for the UK, but warned that there is a risk that consumer spending could moderate sharply. Therefore, sterling remains weak after back-to-back surprise declines in UK retail sales were seen as a sign that consumer spending could have peaked last year, which stands in sharp contrast with the upbeat outlook for the US. Although risks to a sharp falloff in consumer spending worry the BoE and markets, the proactive stance of the MPC pleases the market more than the conservative approach of the ECB. EUR/GBP was little changed around 61 pence.  Yesterday's downward revision to UK GDP showed the economy was flat in Q4, down from a preliminary estimate of 0.2% growth. The revision caught traders off guard, but did not provoke a break of key support at 1.4140. Follow up support is viewed at 1.410 and 1.4075. Upside capped at 1.4260, 1.430 and 1.4345.  Meanwhile, USD/JPY fell to a day's low of 133.57 in early London trade amid profit taking after encountering strong resistance around the 135 area overnight and a remark from Japan's top financial diplomat that the dollar was unlikely to drop sharply. Repatriation concerns also limiting dollar gains, but with repatriation poised to slow near the end of March and net outward investment to resume thereafter dealers expect to see further yen weakness in the weeks to come allowing USD/JPY to target 140 once the 135.00/20 major resistance band is broken. Upside capped at 134.70/85 and strong resistance at 135.15. Support holds at 133.50, 133.20, 133.0 and 132.50.  The Bank of Japan's decision to increase its outright JGB purchases to one trillion yen a month from 800 billion also had an initial supportive effect as it was seen easing funding pressures next month. But the yen's gains evaporated as markets saw little hope in the Japanese government's anti-deflation package.  The yen should not fall too much from the increase in liquidity even though it is supposed to mean a weaker yen because there is more of the currency circulating. Instead, since increasing liquidity in Japan is ineffectual amid structural barriers causing rampant deflation and lack of demand the yen has responded less and less to recent increases in liquidity, because it is not leading to inflation and therefore not diminishing the value of the yen.  Despite BoJ Governor Hayami's remark that today's easing was not politically motivated, Hayami has made public his desire now for the government to inject public funds into the troubled banking sector. Whether there was a quid pro quo agreement remains to be seen. PM Koizumi's anti-deflation package avoided any concrete plan to rescue banks but Hayami worries that without a recapitalization Japanese banks will be threatened with losing international banking licenses because their capital ratios have fallen to below international standards.  Government has tried to avoid a publicly unappealing tax payer fund injection, instead opting for creating a floor under asset prices which will keep banks capital adequacy ratios above the 8% limit set by the BIS. But an injection of funds would allow banks to write off non-performing loans and improve their balance sheets. Therefore, the government's plan is seen as a  muddle through  and more risky for the markets.   	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Final  (exp 94.3, prev 88.8) At 10:00 AM US Jan PMI (exp 49.4, prev 48.2)  USD/JPY maintained above 133.80 in European trade as the dollar whipsawed against the European majors, first higher then back again. The dollar retraced part of an overnight 2.5 yen surge to a fresh 40-month high of 1356.15, but found support above 133.60, which marks the 61.8% retracement of the rally. Meanwhile, favorable European manufacturing data helped the euro off a fresh 6-month low of 85.64 but trade steadied soon afterwards as dealers are now looking to the final leg of a key US data week for direction. Markets will watch to see if the US economy can retain its positive outlook ahead of the January US employment report, PMI data and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey.  Traders are expecting further improvement in today's data after US economic indicators have turned sharply positive. Most notably this week was the astonishing 0.2% rise in 4Q01 GDP. While the market was looking for a decline of around 1%, it again underestimated the ability of US consumers to shop -- even in a recession. In fact, the incredible 5.4% annualized rise in consumer was a recession spending record, just edging out the 5.1% rise in 2Q60.  Given the tumultuous week on Wall Street, dealers will still look to movements there for direction. Today's futures are down 15 points on the Dow and 4 on the Nasdaq. Today's earnings announcements are light, with only a handful of companies reporting. Therefore, the market will react more to today's economic data.  First on today's list is the jobs report for January which is expected to shed a mere 27k after last months 124k loss. This would be a marked improvement reflecting the improving trend in jobless claims in recent weeks.   Then comes the final revision to the University of Michigan's confidence survey. The headline figure is expected to stay steady at 94.3 in January, up from the previous 88.8. However, it is not anticipated to generate waves in FX markets, as forecasts call for the final January reading to remain virtually unchanged at 94.3.   More important will be the ISM (formerly NAPM) Purchasing Managers Index as it looks poised to jump to 49.4 in January from the previous 48.2, possibly even breaching the key 50-level which marks expansion/contraction.  On Thursday, the Chicago PMI rose to 45.1 in January from the previous 41.5. Regional manufacturing was boosted as the production component broke above the key 50-level for the first time since December 2000 into expansionary territory to 50.4 in January. Nevertheless, this month's reading marked the 18th month the manufacturing sector has been in contraction.   This compared to the relatively light manufacturing recession going on in Europe. Today's PMI figures also showed a good recovery with UK PMI rising to 46.2 in January from 45.2 the eleventh consecutive decline. Eurozone PMI also rose to a high of 46.2 in January from 44.1. Although the figure still marked a tenth month of contraction, markets were optimistic that the euro area would follow the US out of a recession.   Meanwhile, traders will also be monitoring this week's World Economic Forum in New York and next week's G7 meeting in Toronto for any dollar policy rhetoric in light of the recent complaints about the strong dollar by manufacturers.  However, the dollar is not likely to come under pressure after yesterday's remarks by Treasury Secretary O'Neill that he had no sympathy for complaints by US manufacturers about the strong dollar because good companies do not ""live and die"" by exchange rates. Furthermore, he said that the current account balance is an ""artifact"", or an outdated way of looking at the economy, countering arguments that the dollar is overvalued because of the imbalance in the US current account.  EUR/USD rose to a day's high of 86-cents following the better than expected PMI data. But the downside risks have increased after the pair breached former support at 85.75 to hit a new 6-month low of 85.65. The euro was not helped by the jump in January euro area inflation to 2.5% as expected. Now, the pair risks closing below support at 86 cents after failing to hold onto gains above 86.30 overnight. Moreover, the single currency would need to regain the 86.80/90 mark to really improve its outlook. Resistance is viewed at 86.80, and the key 87.40/50 level which marks the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.95. A break of 85.60/70 is seen calling upon support at 85.0 and 84.50, which marks the long-term trendline support extending from its 82.25 lows.   GBP/USD fell to a day's low of 1.4063, after sterling dropped from a day's high of 60.72 pence to the euro to a 61 pence low. The rise in EUR/GBP put sterling under pressure to below Thursday's low of $1.4085. Support is seen at this week's 6-month lows around 1.4040. Resistance at 1.4183, which marks the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the 1.4418-1.4038 move, has held so far. Barring a break of this resistance, renewed weakness could prevail.  USD/CHF rose to a 6-month high of 1.7232 before paring gains back to support around 1.7150. Follow up support is seen at 1.7060 and 1.6945, the 50% retracement of the 1.8220 to 1.5770 move. Also keeping pressure on the franc was the Swiss KoF indicator which fell to -1.37 in December from -1.28, marking a worsening of conditions, not a turnaround as many had hoped. Therefore, given the recent bullish data and positive outlook by the Fed, USD/CHF should remain well supported.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

EUR/JPY forged the way, rising 1.5% to a high of 117.62 from an overnight low of 115.65. This outpaced the more modest 0.7% gain in USD/JPY to a day's high of 134.54 and allowed the euro to test key resistance at 87.50. Traders say the euro's upward correction against the dollar could carry as high as 88 cents before a renewed sell off. Euro gains are still seen temporary as capital moves to safer instruments such as gold in the midst of renewed uncertainty.  The dollar remains depressed this week by the ongoing Enron affair, which has spread a dark cloud over the markets and caused investors to overlook recent upbeat US data. Indications are that conditions in the US are improving and that the US economy is on the road to recovery. Therefore, USD weakness should only be temporary and will be mitigated as signs of a rebounding US economy increasingly emerge. Yet, in the meantime the dollar will continue to take its direction from Wall Street.  Currency markets are also likely to hold steady ahead of this weekend's meeting of G7 finance ministers in Canada. USD/JPY upside is therefore seen limited in the near-term since Japan is becoming more reluctant for the yen to weaken further. Especially since this weekend's meeting is likely to spark more cries of foul from US manufacturers that the weak yen is undermining their trade competitiveness.  Tokyo stocks rebounded today after Japanese officials indicated their willingness to use public funds to buy stocks from banks. Bank shares led a rally after Japanese FinMin Shiokawa said his ministry was backing a stock-buying body that would buy shares from banks, which are trying to get rid of their massive shareholdings because losses have eroded their capital. Shiokawa said that his ministry is prepared to spend up to two trillion yen ($14.96 billion) in public money to buy stocks from Japanese banks. ""We must halt this fall in shares. It's like diarrhea, we must stop it,"" he said. Moreover, the offloading of cross-shareholdings by banks and insurance companies has been a big factor in the Nikkei's slide. The index ended up 2% from Wednesday's 18-year low, but it is still down 30% since January 1, 2001. Historically, the popular index is down 75% from its 1989 bubble high of 38915.  JPY fell over one yen to a day's low of 134.54 against the dollar after reaching a day's high of 133.58 and 115.97 against the euro following the Bank of Japan's decision to keep monetary policy unchanged. The central bank's reluctance to add further liquidity came as no surprise, but markets had pushed the yen to earlier session lows of 134.17 against the dollar in the hope the BoJ would take further action.   USD/JPY upside is seen capped at 134.50 followed by 135.20. The pair is also expected to remain within the 132-135 range over the short term as the cost of the weak yen policy has been detrimental to asset prices as it undermines confidence in the ability to hold value. Therefore, given the weakened state of Japanese financial institutions amid falling stock prices, the Japanese are now more likely to shun yen weakness in order to restore confidence in the market.  Meanwhile, EUR/USD could break 87.50 and test as high as 87.75-88.00 if the US has another disappointing day on Wall Street. However, dealers still regard this as the top of an upward correction in the euro as the dollar bears the brunt of  Enronitis.  Support is seen at 87.00/15 and 86.45.  GBP/USD rose to a high of 1.4169 on the back of EUR/USD strength despite sterling falling to a 2-week low of 61.96 pence to the euro. But only a move above 1.4177 would add to sterling's strength against the dollar.  This level marks the 61.8% retracement of the decline from 1.4247 to 1.4064. Cable peaked at a 1-week high of 1.4247 in European trade on Tuesday and that marks the next resistance. Support is seen at 1.4115 and failure to maintain above 1.4110 would call upon key support at 1.4180, which marks the 38.2% retracement of the 1.4418-1.4038 move. Follow up support is seen at last week's 6-month lows of 1.4045. Upside capped at 1.4235, 1.4270 and 1.4300.  The only data from the US today is wholesale inventories. They will likely show that merchants continued to make progress trimming inventories in December, although sales also likely remained lackluster. The lack of data means the dollar will take its cue from Wall Street, which continues to follow the developments in the Enron affair. Today's earnings announcements include Goodyear Tire & Rubber, Universal and Wendy s International    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Bundesbank President Welteke commented that Germany would need a ""lot of luck"" to achieve the government's official growth forecast of 0.75% this year, but denied Germany would post negative growth and enter a recession. As economic growth in the Europe continues to slowdown everyone is looking at the ECB to  take a more proactive role in stimulating growth by cutting interest rates. Despite the ECB's inclination to ostensibly prioritize price stability over growth, remarks by ECB president Duisenberg echoing those of the EU leaders that there is room to maneuver policy should inflation fall sooner than expected would seem to suggest the ECB is flexible and may indeed slash rates by the end of the year, as many analysts anticipate. However, Duisenberg maintained his mantra that inflation will likely fall below 2% possibly early next year. A Reuters poll conducted yesterday showed that 27 out of 50 economists believe the ECB will hold rates steady, 21 expect a rate cut and 2 are undecided. Support is seen at the 200-day moving average of 89.50, followed by 89.0 and 88.55. Resistance is seen at 90.15, 90.35 and 90.65.  The yen is almost unchanged from Friday's closing vs. the dollar after advancing against the euro to a 3-week high of 108.88, due to poor German IFO survey. Japanese Finance Minister Shiokawa proposed an extra budget of 3 trillion yen, out of which 1.68 trillion yen will be financed by government bonds. Finally, Koizumi declared that the structural reforms must proceed whether GDP is plus or minus. Economic Minister Takenaka said that redenomination of yen could be one of the methods to revive the economy. Takenaka is hoping to put the issue on the agenda for structural economic reform planned for fiscal 2002. Tokyo think tank predicted that Japan unemployment could rise to over 6% in the next fiscal year after jobless rate hit record of 5% in July and August.  USD/JPY support is seen at 120.65, 120.20 and 120.0. Resistance is eyed at 121.50 and 121.80. Leaders of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation finished their 2 day summit on Sunday condemning terrorism and promising to boost the global economy hit by prolonged slowdown and September 11 attacks.   Looking ahead to next week, the major indicators from the US include the Index of Leading Indicators, the Employee Cost Index, durable goods, existing and new home sales, and the University of Michigan Confidence Survey. From the Eurozone, key data due for release are German CPI and PPI, Italian Industrial Orders, Italian CPI, ISAE Industrial and Consumer Confidence Survey, French CPI, Italian Foreign trade, Euroarea M3 data and foreign trade. Markets await the ECB rate announcement on Thursday October 25, even though the central bank is unlikely to ease monetary policy next week.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

March 4, 2002


TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing
Members

The expiration date for the April 2002 options contract for Silver (SO J2)
and Gold (OG J2) is Friday, March 8, 2002.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


Trading in the April 2002 Silver and Gold Options Contracts will cease at
1:25 P.M. and 1:30 P.M. respectively on March 8, 2002.  All Brokers and
Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions to exercise
or abandon such Options by 3:30 P.M.

On Friday, March 8, 2002, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a duly
authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 4:00 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special ""OLTE"" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:30 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Friday's submissions and processing will be
available on Monday morning March 11, 2002.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
(""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:30 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

Here's what's making headlines today:

U.S. bombing of Taliban targets was halted as diplomats stepped up talks
on the future of Afghanistan. The Northern Alliance said it has given the
Taliban a three-day ultimatum to surrender, while the U.S. is promising
more money to Afghans to reveal Osama bin Laden's whereabouts.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/STRIKE_MAIN.html

Police in Spain believe they have made some of the most significant
arrests yet in connection with the Sept. 11 attacks.

PHOTOGRAPHING THE SEASONS - provided by the New York Institute of
Photography
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here are some ideas to help you take pictures that capture the essence of
the current season - winter, spring, summer, or fall. Even if you're in a
different latitude and your climate is considerably different from ours in
New York, you may still find valuable tips here. Our discussion of a
particular picture that we think captures the essence of the current
season in the Northern Hemisphere often involves a photographic technique
that is basic to good photography in general. So, whether you live in
Australia or Oahu, Beijing or Boston, check out this page for ideas you
may be able to use now or later.

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.

[IMAGE] Forums Discuss these points in the Forums:  Forexnews Forum       Technicals Live Charts Analysis available from: Cornelius Luca   J.P. Chorek   Technical Research Ltd.   Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  USD Rises Across the Board on Fears Over Japan's Reforms  February 19, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8684 $/JPY..133.84 GBP/$..1.4247 $/CHF..1.7014  USD Rises Across the Board on Fears Over Japan's Reforms by Jes Black  At 8:30:00 AM US Jan Building Permits (exp 1.6 mln, prev 1.654 mln) US Jan Housing Starts (exp 1.6 mln, prev 1.570 mln)  USD added to its gains on Tuesday first against the yen, then against the European majors as dealers punished the yen for doubts about Prime Minister Koizumi's ability to reform Japan. USD/JPY rose to a one-week high of 134.01 while EUR/USD briefly broke through chart support at 86.80 and fell to a near two-week low of 86.66. GBP/USD also broke support at 1.4260 and fell to a one-week low of 1.4228.  USD/JPY rose to a new one-week high of 134.01 as traders reacted to Japan's inability to tackle key reforms pledges. Markets grew weary with Japanese rhetoric on Tuesday after listening intently last week to a number of assurances to shore up the financial system and tackle deflation. The market was also disappointed by Japan's shying away on the injection of public funds into the troubled banking sector. This led to a sell off in Mizuho Holdings, the world's biggest bank by assets, which fell 7.36%. Earlier this month the banking sector encountered a sell off which drove the Nikkei to 18-year lows until the Japanese government announced it was ready to shore up the troubled sector.  But there is a reason for government apprehension. For instance, the more aggressively the government pursues the disposal of non-performing loans (NPL), the more it will increase unemployment and deflation, thus depressing the economy even further in the short run. Therefore Japan will talk tough but likely take a less aggressive approach towards large institutions by again throwing money at the problem. Instead of getting rid of all problem loans, which would bankrupt many debtors, a kinder approach - like the bailout of the Daiei retail chain - will likely prevail. Although this is presumably not what Koizumi means by tough reform, given his declining political capital, it is more likely he will opt to rescue some key companies to avoid an unwelcome surge in joblessness. The end result is a lose/lose situation for JPY, thus the sell off seen today.  However, USD/JPY gains were constrained by repatriation flows back to Japan ahead of the March 31 book closing. Precisely because of troubled banks and indebted companies are forced to shore up their books ahead of the fiscal year end. Afterwards, the yen is likely to come back under pressure as Japan begins to tackle deflation and prevent a financial crisis. But how they plan to do this remains unclear. USD/JPY support is seen at 133.70, 132.65 and 132.35. Resistance is seen at 134.00 and 135.00.  EUR/USD fell to a day's low of 86.66 after breaking the 86.80 level which marks the 50% retracement of the 85.63 to 88.03 move. Follow up support is seen at 86.50, which is the 61.8% retracement of the same move. A break of that level would likely send the euro back to February's 6-month low of 85.63. Meanwhile, failure to regain the key 87.40/50 mark will likely keep pressure on the pair after it rebounded from last week's lows but met with heavy resistance at 87.46.  The euro rebounded from a day's low of 86.66 following a positive reaction to E12 December industrial production which rose as expected by 0.8%. Although the year on year rate was still down 4.1%, the data appears to have marked a turnaround for the troubled manufacturing sector, which is bullish for the euro.   German think tank Ifo's Sinn also raised eyebrows when he said that the EU's prediction for Germany's deficit was too harsh. This indicated that Germany may not face censure by the EU later this year for breaking the 3% debt/GDP ratio set out by the Maastrict treaty.  GBP/USD slipped to a new one-week low of 1.4228 after breaking last week's low of 1.4250. On Monday, cable bounced up to an overnight high of 1.4330 but failed to break key resistance around1.4340/50, which marks the 61.8% retracement of the move from 1.4515-1.4040 and has so far provided tough resistance. Without a break of that level, the pair remains heavy, dealers say. A break of support at 1.4250 seen targeting support at previous resistance levels of 1.4235 and 1.4180.  Today's verbal intervention in the interest rate market by the Bank of England's George surprised markets but did not weigh on the pound. George sought to quell speculation that UK interest rates are set to rise sharply this year, as the futures market is pricing in a rise from 4% to 5%, which is quite aggressive considering the weak inflationary environment. By doing so the BoE is saying the futures market overreacted and that interest rates are not likely to rise substantially this year.   A rise in wholesale price figures from Germany also had little reaction in the market as inflationary pressures are benign.  Meanwhile, housing start data from the US today is unlikely to affect markets, which will continue to focus on earnings news and any further fallout from the Enron affair. Omnicom Group Inc., the world's third-largest advertising company, said on Tuesday its fourth-quarter earnings rose 15 percent, despite the advertising slump that has besieged the sector for the past year. S?futures trading down 7, Nasdaq futures trading down 18 points.   	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   2.0%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.75-2.75%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Dollar Regains Momentum as Confidence in US Outlook Rises  November 19, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8793 $/JPY..123.38 GBP/$..1.4211 $/CHF..1.6660  Dollar Regains Momentum as Confidence in US Outlook Rises by Jes Black  At 8:30:00 AM US Oct Housing Permits (exp 1.510 mln, prev 1.524 mln) US Oct Housing Starts (exp 1.520 mln, prev 1.574 mln)  The dollar added to earlier gains and soared to fresh 3-month high of 123.49 yen and a 3-1/2 week high of $1.4213 against the pound in European trade as markets anticipated renewed enthusiasm for a V-shaped recovery in the US. After falling to profit taking on Friday, following the largest drop in US industrial production in 11 years to -1.1%, the dollar regained its momentum as investors showed they still prefer the future outlook for USD over other major currencies. The dollar index is now at highs last seen in August, at 116.89, which put the euro under pressure at a day's low of $0.8789.   EUR/USD peaked around 88.60 on Friday, but was unable to hold onto gains above 88.40, which led the pair back towards the 88-cent level on Monday. Last week, the euro flirted with 88 cents, but maintained above key resistance around 87.45. The Bundesbank November monthly report indicated as expected that Q3 growth was flat for the Eurozone's number one economy. Flat growth in Q2 also contributed to a year on year growth rate of around 0.25%, down from 0.6% in Q2, thus showing that Germany is very close to a technical recession. EUR/USD edged back below 88 cents, but did not trigger stop loss orders and held to a day's low of 87.89.  Traders anticipate Wednesday's release of Germany's Ifo business climate index (an estimate of German growth, which accounts for about one-third of the Eurozone) to recover slightly in November to 86 after plunging to 85 in October from 89.5. Markets also await Eurozone industrial production figures for September, which likely dropped since French and Italian outputs declined. Disappointing results will most likely spark renewed selling in the euro. Support is seen at the 88-cent figure, backed by 87.70 and 87.45. Resistance is seen at 89.0, 89.30 and 89.50.  USD/JPY rose to a new 3-1/2 week high of 123.49, following another grim assessment of the Japanese economy by the Bank of Japan in its November report. ""Adjustments in economic activity are becoming severe, as the substantial decline in production is beginning to have an adverse effect on private consumption through decreases in employment and income,"" the BoJ said in the monthly report. This was the sixth straight month the Bank cited weakening private consumption and falling corporate profits at banks and the deterioration in the manufacturing sector will add weakness to domestic demand, it said.   Following another downgrade in Japan's economic outlook, it now appears that FY02 tax revenue will probably be revised down by Y2.8 trln from Y49.6 trln, according to the MoF. Therefore, sticking to PM Koizumi's important reform to limit JGB issuance to 30 trillion yen in FY02 will be difficult. In order to achieve this, further expenditure cuts will be needed, which will likely find strong opposition within Koizumi's own LDP party. Japanese FinMin Shiokawa maintained that the government would limit new issuance to Y30 trln, but more LDP lawmakers are now openly requesting further fiscal stimulus. Aggravating the situation is that tax projection for FY02 is most likely to be revised down further.  Adding pressure to the yen is the fact that the BoJ decided by majority vote to keep monetary policy unchanged last week. It had eased in August and again in September but has since been keeping a wait-and-see stance. Interest rates are still near zero and its liquidity supply in the money market exceeds its stated target of 6 trillion yen. Moreover, another possible move by the BoJ would be to purchase more foreign bonds, which would lead to a substantial fall in the yen.   Rumor of selling interest in USD/JPY by exporters around 123.20 capping gains. Technical resistance around 123.35 also limiting upside potential. Meanwhile, with little room for improvement in the Japanese economy until late next year, most market watchers see the yen heading for 125 now that it has successfully breached the 123 mark. Resistance is seen around 123.35/45. But USD/JPY support is expected to hold at 121.95/122.00 followed by 121.40/50, with any pullback towards the latter level seen as a buying opportunity, dealers said.  EUR/GBP rose to a fresh high of 62.05 but is expected to stay rangebound at around 61-62 pence after recovering from recent 10-week lows around 60 pence. When that cross is steady, GBP/USD shadows the movements in the more dominant EUR/USD. So far, cable has fallen to a new one-month low of 1.4210 as it continues to suffer further declines since last Wednesday's inflation report by the Bank of England signaled a shift in market sentiment. The market is now more aware of the weaknesses the UK faces due to the internal and external imbalances in the economy. BoE's King pointed out that those imbalances might lead to a weaker pound. Moreover, the Bank appears more concerned about future inflationary pressures given that interest rates are now at a 40-year low. Therefore, interest rates are likely to be left on hold just as the labor market is showing its first signs of weakness, which will weigh on the pound. Major support now stands at 1.4195 after GBP fell below key levels of 1.4250 and 1.4230.  Meanwhile, USD/CHF rose to a session high around 1.6673 after falling to a low of 1.6536 on Friday. Helping the dollar were comments from Swiss National Bank Chairman Jean-Pierre Roth who said the outlook for the U.S. economy is uncertain but could improve if the war in Afghanistan ended. ""The uncertainty is currently unusually great. But there is a certain chance now that the developments could come out better than feared. If and when it is true that the war in Afghanistan is over, that could give some important psychological impetus,"" he said. ""Switzerland is so dependent on world trade that of course we cannot escape from developments abroad,"" he said. Moreover, the SNB aimed to conduct monetary policy ""so that our interest rates are as low as possible in order to provide relief for the economy, but so that at the same time, we do not endanger price stability,"" he added. Inflation in Switzerland is below one percent.  On Friday, Roth said in an interview with the Financial Times that the Swiss franc's role as a safe-haven currency is declining because of the emergence of the euro. Thus Roth felt more at ease that the Swiss franc is reverting to the status of a normal currency as it becomes ""less important as a financial asset"". The Swiss National Bank has been dismayed by the appreciation in the Swiss franc as investors sought shelter amidst recent political uncertainty, thereby prompting the central bank to cut rates. Roth asserted that ""if we were to face large capital inflows we would have to respond through monetary policy and interest rates"" because ""it is an illusion to think that we have other instruments that we could use to curb inflows"". Upside capped at 1.6680 and 1.670. Support holds at 1.6535, 1.650 and 1.6480.  Today's US data is expected to show a decline in housing starts as the slowdown in the general economy starts to outweigh the benefits of record low mortgage rates. However, USD strength continues to stem from the belief that the US-backed war in Afghanistan is going better than anticipated and this is translating into a fall in uncertainty and a rise in confidence. Accordingly, dealers anticipate further gains on Wall Street this week, which is adding to the dollar's buoyancy.   	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

European majors got a break on Wednesday as currencies looked oversold against the dollar after heavy losses over the past week. Investors took profit from the dollar's rise to multi-week highs and shied away from taking new long positions ahead of tomorrow's European Central Bank meeting. On Tuesday, heightened fears over new anthrax threats reminded markets of the risks to the US economy, and gave a good reason for a minor correction. EUR/USD rose to a session high of 89.44 in European trade, up from an overnight 6-week low of 88.70, but lackluster trade failed to push the dollar significantly lower. Sterling rose over one cent from overnight 9-week lows just below 1.42 to a session high of 1.4306. However, there was no real enthusiasm to take out new long positions in the European currencies after the recent bout of losses against the dollar, and the still prevailing sentiment favors the prospects of the US economy over Europe and Japan.  Bank of Canada's surprise 75 bp cut on Tuesday is likely to make the ECB look like Ebenezer Scrooge tomorrow. The bold move won approval from FX traders who pushed the Canadian dollar higher across the board. The boldness also stands in sharp contrast the ECB's contention that it needs to worry about inflationary concerns and not growth. The cards are definitely stacked against the ECB, but the bank has been resisting the pressure. However, whether or not they do cut rates tomorrow is uncertain because the ECB is know for wrong-footing the market.  Correspondingly, economists polled by Reuters are split over the outcome of the ECB meeting, but most expect the central bank to trim its rates by at least a quarter point by the end of next month. Therefore, a 25 bp cut has already been priced into the market, which makes the prospect for a euro rally insignificant were the ECB to lower rates by just 0.25%. A more surprising 50 bp cut would trigger a substantial rise in the euro, possibly above the 90-cent figure. But that appears to be an unlikely outcome because ECB member remarks over the weekend gave the impression the bank was in no hurry to lower rates. In the absence of a cut, EUR/USD is expected to fall, targeting yesterday's low of 88.70 followed by the 88.25/50 area on its way to 87.25, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of this year's uptrend from 83.45 to 93.35.  Preliminary data from 3 German states on Tuesday suggested that the national inflation rate is falling towards the ECB's 2.0% target, while data from Italian cities suggested the overall Italian inflation rate is on course to slip to 2.5% in October from the prior month's 2.6%. As expected, today's data from Germany showed import prices declined further to -3.6% y/y in September from -0.9% last month. This bodes well for the inflation outlook in the Eurozone but may not sway the European Central Bank to cut rates this Thursday.  Unfortunately for the central bank, both the market and member economies are calling for a rate cut. That is what caused a bout of euro selling on Monday and Tuesday to a 6-1/2 week low of 88.70 cents. However, the ECB does not like being put in the position where its independence is questioned, and that is another reason the bank is likely to hold off on cutting rates tomorrow. In the meantime, trading appears subdued as dealers brace themselves for either ECB action or inaction. European money market rates were also steady in lackluster trade as dealers held their books closed ahead of the decision.  Dealers also waited on the sidelines ahead of a speech by US Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill later in the day. O'Neill is due to testify on the semi-annual FX report before the Senate Banking Committee at 10:00 AM, and markets are acutely aware of the risks to the dollar if the  strong dollar  policy is brought back into question. Chairman Greenspan is also scheduled to speak at 6:45 PM on globalization at the Institute for International Economics.  Sterling dropped sharply from highs around 1.43 to a European session low of 1.4259 following the CBI Q3 report showing business confidence among UK manufacturers plummeted to its lowest in three years in October. The latest quarterly industrial trends survey is the first where all the responses came in after last month's attacks on the United States, and the CBI cautioned that confidence could be unduly influenced in the short term by such dramatic events. Expected orders balance fell to -25 vs +1 in July. Monthly total orders fell -33 vs -31 in September. The business optimism balance fell to -54 in October from -22 in the last survey. The CBI also called for a 50 bp cut from the Bank of England, the first time in three years the CBI has called for such a large rate cut.  USD/JPY rose to a session high of 122.82 but failed to break heavy profit-taking orders above 122.80 yen. USD fell from overnight highs around 123 JPY and traded most of the day above support at 122.50. Stop-loss sell orders were thought to be lined up between 122.00 to 122.20 yen, which would push the dollar lower if triggered. EUR/JPY broke out of the 108.50 to 109.50 range, as it hit a session high of 109.67. However, the cross is likely to remain trading sideways if the euro cannot maintain its gains above the 89-cent mark.  Dealers will also look to see if Wall Street enjoys Wednesday better than it did yesterday in the face of earnings reports for Q3. So far, 85% of the companies reporting matched or exceeded projected earnings targets. Today's lineup before the bell are Honneywell, Viacom and Kodac, and very few key companies are reporting after the bell. Both Dow and Nasdaq futures are in positive territory.   After the market close, the Fed will release the October Beige Book after no release in September. Dealers will look to see if it points to continued economic weakness or if new orders for manufacturing is picking up. Manufacturing continues to be the primary drag on the regional economies, and the beige book noted in the July report that the impact has spread to other industries. Recall that it was this report that sparked this summer's decline in the dollar.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Traders look to break important psychological resistance at 135 yen but wary of possible comments from Fed Chairman Greenspan tomorrow.US Treasury Secretary O'Neill's comments overnight that only structural reforms, and not currency depreciation, would solve the Japanese banking quandary and increase productivity send the yen to a three year lows. O'Neill added that he does not believe Japan was deliberately weakening the yen. Nonetheless, analysts interpreted his comments to mean that the US would be tolerant of a weaker yen. Despite MoF Mizoguchi's denials that neither O'Neill or Shiokawa approved of yen weakness in their meeting, investors sold the yen as Finance Minister Shiokawa, Economics Minister Takenaka and Prime Minister Koizumi all reiterated that FX rates should be determined by markets. In addition, the MoF's Kuroda stressed that Japan did not intend to drive the yen down, though he suggested that a weak yen, which is reflective of Japan's poor economy, could help the situation. Kuroda also brushed aside concerns from Japan's Asian neighbors that the yen's depreciation would negatively impact their economies because they have more flexible exchange rate policies and stronger foreign reserve positions following the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis. Japan's customs cleared trade surplus fell 18.4% in December from a year earlier, to 667.2 bln yen. Japan's surplus with the US (its largest trading partner) was down 23.6% y/y to 526.9 bln yen. The trade surplus for the 2001 fell 38.3% from the previous year at 6.6115 trln yen, a third consecutive year of decline. Resistance is eyed at 134.63, 135.0 and 135.50. Support holds at 133.60, backed by 133.0 and 132.60.   EUR/USD is trading near its one month lows of 87.80 after European Central Bank president Duisenberg's testimony before the EU's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee suggested that a rate cut in the foreseeable future is unlikely. He further noted that the recent decline in confidence may have bottomed out. Duisenberg also had the temerity to say that he was uncertain that a US recovery would be quicker than one in the Eurozone, because while the Federal Reserve cut interest rates faster than the ECB, the US rates were higher from the outset. He remarked that monetary policy could impact growth in the short-run but not in the long run, and thus reiterated that the current level of ECB rates is considered appropriate. Support seen at 87.70 and 87.50-- the 31.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. Resistance is viewed at 88.90, followed by 89.10-- the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the same move, and 89.55.  The pound slightly recovered at 1.4232 after falling  to a 1-1/2 month low of 1.4222 against the dollar and to a 2-week low of .6213 against the euro, weighed by weak data and comments from an official indicating her support for euro membership. The UK trade deficit widened to 2.84 bln pounds in November from the previous month's deficit of 2.39 bln. Furthermore, the Confederation of British Industry noted in a quarterly survey that manufacturing output was declining at its fastest pace in 2-1/2 years and thus called on the Bank of England to enact another rate cut. The pound was hurt after British Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt commented on the benefits of joining the euro, including currency stability and cost transparency. Moreover, she expressed the opinion that there is something fundamentally wrong in the current euro/pound exchange rate when highly productive manufacturing plants were struggling to export profitably to the Eurozone. Support at 1.4221-- the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from the January 8, 2001 high of 1.5101 to the June 12, 2001 low of 1.3680. Next downward target is seen at 1.420 and 1.4160. Upside capped at 1.430, 1.4360 and 1.440.a small chance of a rate cut at the Jan 30 meeting, leaving the majority to believe rates will be held steady at a 40-year low of 1.75%.  The National Association of Manufacturers today praised US Treasury O'Neill in his remarks yesterday when he said that currency depreciation policies could not:""repair underlying  economic problems such as productivity or non-performing bank loans"".  NAM described O'Neill's words as being ""right on the money"" which were deemed to shed light on the 10% fall in the yen of the past 4 weeks. The remarks follow a letter to the Treasury last week citing numerous negative effects of the strong dollar, including loss of business share in global markets, increased layoffs of employees, and relocation of plants overseas.  Having said that, Secretary O'Neill still reiterated the US strong dollar policy as a way to avoid any uncontrollable decline in the US currency should his words to Japan may be misunderstood to be intentionally weakening the dollar. Mr Kuroda of Japan's MoF wrote today in the FT that the declining yen reflected the nation's ailing economic situation and did not emanate from deliberate government policies.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
(""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 8:00 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

"(02-59) Members' Group Long Term Disability Renewal","Notice No:  02-59
February 15, 2002



To:		NYMEX Division and COMEX Division Members

From:		Barry Loyal
		Human Resources Department

Subject:	Members' Group Long Term Disability Renewal


Effective March 1, 2002 the Members' Group Long -Term Disability plan will
be renewed with UNUM insurance company. As a result of poor claims
experience, the cost to maintain disability coverage for the membership has
increased dramatically. As a result, changes had to be made in order to
maintain this program for our Members.

The changes that will take effect March 1, 2002 are set forth below:

_ Mental/Nervous Disorder or Alcohol/Drug related disabilities would be
covered for 12 months instead of 24 months.

? The Elimination/Waiting period before one starts to receive benefits will
increase from 90 to 180 days.

? The final change relates to the offset of payments under the members'
disability policy should a member have other Group Disability insurance
policies. Commencing March 1, 2002 the policy will provide that if a Member
begins to receive benefits and has another Group Disability policy, payments
received under such other Group Disability policies would reduce benefits
received under the NYMEX policy. Please note that if you own an individual
policy that is not issued through a group or association it will not be
effected or reduced by any group policy.

These changes were necessary in order to keep our program in place for the
future. The rates that we were able to negotiate are only guaranteed for one
year and we hope that our claims experience improves so that we can maintain
this program at a competitive price for years to come.

For your information a summary sheet on the benefits offered members is
attached.

If you have any questions regarding these plan changes and how they might
affect you, please contact Warren Rosen at 212.949-9200. You may also call
me at 212-299-2203.

The widely followed IFO survey, due on Friday, is another significant indicator of the economic outlook in Germany, the Euro-zone's biggest economy. The latest Reuters poll projects the IFO index will decline to a new 5-year low of 88.1 from the previous 89.5. The index was at its highest levels at 107.3 in November 1990, and its lowest point of 76.7 was reached in 1982. The single currency is also undermined by market perception that the ECB is behind the curve in cutting interest rates to promote growth. Today's release of the Bank's October Bulletin echoed last week's statements by Bank Chief Duisenberg that the Bank is closely monitoring monetary developments. It reiterated that monetary developments showed no risks of inflation but still called for vigilance. But even if increased hints of a near-term rate cut might appear to ease the euro's undecisiveness, the mounting jobless situation in the Eurozone is also taking its toll on the region's economy. More than 650,000 jobs were lost over the last couple of months. EUR/$ faces resistance at the congestion area of 90.70-75, followed by 91.35, which is the 20-day moving average . Support stands at 90 cents backed by 89.70 and 88.38, which is the 50% retracement of the rise from 83.90 to 93.35.  The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said it would cut its 2002 growth forecast by half according to a preliminary report. US 2002 growth forecast revised to 1.3% from the earlier 3.1%, EU 2002 growth forecast revised to 1.5% from 2.7%, Japan 2002 growth down to -0.8% from earlier projections of 1.1%.   USD/JPY remained in mostly lethargic trade deviating little from its 200-day Moving Average of 121. The last 6 trading session had seen increasingly tight ranges reflecting the uncertainty on behalf of traders, reflecting risk aversion by Japanese traders to venture. The yen rose after the ex US Secretary of Treasury  Rubin said  a weak yen is not an answer to Japan's economic problems  and  solution lies in the area of structural reform, things like open credit markets and dealing with fiscal problems  Japanese Finance Minister Shiokawa said the yen is still strong and should weaken a bit more, which could hint further forex interventions ahead. Japanese govt. sold around $25 bln in yen in seven forex interventions to weaken its currency which is making exports less competitive and adding to more problems to already weak economy. The govt. plans to spend some 95 bln yen to boost subsidies for unemployed as part of its half-trillion yen spending for employment in the supplementary budget for fiscal 2001. Winter bonuses for Japanese employees are likely to decline on average by 3% , a fifth consecutive year of decline, which is likely to further weigh on spending. Two day meeting in Shanghai by ministers from 21 Pacific Rim economies will likely produce a  strong commitment  to free trade as a way to fight terrorism. Support starts at 120.80 backed by 120.50 and 120.20. Upside seen capped at 121.20-25, with follow-up buying testing 121.50 and 121.80.  Markets will consider tomorrow's release of the September Ifo survey from Germany (4 AM Eastern Time ,  8AM GMT) expected to drop to a fresh 5-year low of 88 from the previous 89.5. The report, this week's most important release from the Eurozone, should reflect a substantial period after the Sep 11 attacks, thus will likely show a fresh arrest of business confidence and expectations. 4   hours later, US markets will see the release of the September CPI, which is expected to rise by 0.6% from August's 0.1% with the increase mainly stemming from a temporary boost in gasoline prices. Also at 8:30 AM is the August trade data expected to show an improvement in the deficit to -$27 bln from -$27.9 .    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  March 4, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8692 $/JPY..132.00 GBP/$..1.4225 $/CHF..1.6994  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  by Darko Pavlovic  No key data.   The yen is trading above 132 vs. the dollar, after reaching a two week highs of 131.85 boosted by a 5.9% or 638 point surge in the Nikkei to a 6-month high of 11,450 due to yen repatriation ahead of the fiscal year end on March 31. If Nikkei continues to rise on Tuesday, which is likely, given the surge in US stocks today (The Dow skyrocketed 2.1% or 217 points to 10586 and NASDAQ rose 3.1% or 56 points to 1859) the yen could strengthen vs. the dollar to a year highs of 130.30. Investors were encouraged by signs that large Japanese banks, such as Mizuho that let construction company Sato Kogyo go bankrupt, were taking steps to address the issue of non-performing loans. Moreover, the Nikkei has been lifted by the government's announcement of more stringent requirements on short-selling stocks last week. Furthermore, investors welcomed news that the Bank of Japan had increased its monetary base by 27.5% in February, in its largest rise since the oil crisis in 1974, reflective of Japan's efforts to address its ailing economy. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that according to 98 company presidents and chairpersons surveyed late last month 70.4% think that structural reforms promised by PM Koizumi are ""slightly behind schedule . Some 61.4% cited ""elimination of nonperforming loans"" as the lagging area of structural reform, and over 90% are unsatisfied with progress made on bad loan disposals. Top officials from banking and life insurance industry groups said Monday that the government should stop the development of the state-run savings and life insurance systems, as they force private financial institutions' operations. A public postal corporation, to be set up in 2003, must watch its innovative plan of balancing the private sectors and bound the area of its operations. January workers' total cash earnings totaled Y302, 118 down 2.3% from a year earlier, according to preliminary data released Monday by the Ministry of Labor, due to the harshness in employment situation and signifying consumer spending could decline further in months ahead. Japanese Economic Minister Takenaka said that bank problems after special inspections would become main issue for Japan govt. Takenaka added that daily stock market price swings should not be yardstick for govt policy and  FinMin Shiokawa said would make more effort for specific anti-deflation measures. Shiokawa  also said Tokyo stocks won't rise decisively unless economy recovers. USD/JPY support is seen at 132.0, 131.75 and 131.50. Resistance is viewed at 134.0, 134.40 and 134.80.  EUR/USD is trading just below 87 cents after rising to a 1-week high of 87.13 after Eurozone business climate indicator climbed to its highest in 5 months to -0.86 in February suggesting an economic recovery is occurring. The EU's Rato noted the presence of signs of an economic pick up in the US and Europe, and thus he expects a recovery to consolidate over the next few months. In the meantime, the EU's Solbes also expressed his expectation for a gradual recovery in the first half of this year, since he believed the Eurozone economy bottomed last quarter. Solbes projected the European economies would post average growth rate of 1.5% in 2002. Upside capped at 87.20, 87.40 and 87.80. Support stands at 86.30, backed by the 86.0-cent figure, and 85.50.  Major data due from the US this week consist of factory orders, jobless claims, productivity, consumer credit, and the labor market report. Key Eurozone indicators include the Euroarea Services PMI, Euroarea unemployment, German Services PMI, French Services PMI, Italian Services PMI, Spanish industrial production, German manufacturing orders, German unemployment, ECB rate decision, Italian GDP and Dutch CPI. The main data releases from the UK are the purchasing managers survey for services, the CBI survey of distributive trades, the NTC/FRES report on jobs, housing starts and the Bank of England's rate decision. Highlights from Japan comprise the MoF corporate survey, trade balance, indices of business conditions, GDP, money supply and wholesale prices.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  JPY Gains on Nikkei Advance, USD Firm vs European FX  March 4, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8635 $/JPY..132.25 GBP/$..1.4164 $/CHF..1.7108  JPY Gains on Nikkei Advance, USD Firm vs European FX by Jes Black  No Key Data.   The yen soared Monday morning on the back of a 5.9% rise in the Nikkei to a 6-month high of 11,450. The rally caught many investors by surprise and added to Friday's corrective gains in JPY. The Bank of Japan also said that it flooded Japan's monetary base by 27.5% y/y in February, the largest rise since the oil crisis of 1974. While this move was welcomed by the stock market, traditional economics teaches that is a negative for the yen. But, in the run up to March 31 fiscal year-end, the government's attempts to sustain a floor under Japanese share prices will have a restrictive effect on foreigners selling of Japanese shares over the coming weeks.   Last week saw another strong sell off in USD/JPY after being rejected around 135.00. USD/JPY broke trendline support around 133.50 on Thursday and has yet to recover. Now, a break of key support at 132.00/131.80 seen as bearish implication for the pair and would open up a downside target of 130.45. But downward momentum is expected to bottom today, which could lend support to the pair above the key 132.00/131.80 area. Upside capped at 133.0, 133.50 and 133.70, 134.00/10, 134.70/85 and strong resistance at 135.15. Support holds at 132.20 and 131.80.  Adding to yen strength was this weekend's failure of construction contractor, Sato Kogyo, which has been taken as a positive sign that non-performing loans are at last starting to be tackled. But, today's rally was mostly the result of the government's short-sighted policy to reduce stock market manipulation and urge domestic pension funds to buy along with adding funds to the stock buy-back scheme.  This, the government hopes, will avoid a financial crisis ahead of fiscal year end. If it keeps the Nikkei at or above 10,000, it would avoid the need for an infusion of taxpayers' money to help rid banks of non-performing loans. The government dislikes the idea of another public injection, as it would amount to an admonition of failure and be politically unappealing. But putting an artificial floor under Japanese share prices is likely to prove short-lived as dealers expect any gains to give way to a new wave of selling in the new fiscal year in April, which would lead back to yen weakness.  Moreover, with repatriation poised to slow near the end of March and net outward investment to resume thereafter dealers expect to see further yen weakness in the weeks to come allowing USD/JPY to target 140 once the 135.00/20 major resistance band is broken.   EUR/USD was unchanged after a better than expected rise in consumer confidence data which the European Commission said confirmed its forecast that the economic recovery in the Eurozone would begin in the first quarter of 2002. But the slight increase in consumer confidence to minus 9 from minus 11 only translated into a meager 0.2 rise in the overall economic sentiment survey to 99.2 in February from 99.0. Weighing on the whole was business sentiment which did not change at minus 14, disappointing the consensus estimate of an improvement to minus 11.9.  EUR/USD gave up earlier gains and fell back towards last week's 3-week low of 86.25. Traders were not encouraged by Eurozone prospects and sentiment is again turning bearish enough to target a move through 86.30/15 on its way to its 6-month low of 85.63. Support is seen at 86.30, 86.15, and 85.60. Resistance is viewed at 86.60, 87.10, and 87.85.  Meanwhile, the focus this week will be the BoE and ECB which both meet on Thursday this week. Stronger than expected E12 PMI data last week and a further gain in consumer confidence are likely to reinforce the ECB's resolve to keeps rates unchanged this week.  The BoE is also likely to keep rates unchanged after UK February manufacturing PMI rose unexpectedly above the 50-mark last Friday indicating manufacturing has recovered from yearlong contraction. However, sterling is likely to remain weakened by EMU expectations, and because of the fact that BoE Governor George again tried to talk down the sterling strength. Moreover, the strong performance of US stocks on Friday is likely to underpin USD as investors switch back into risk seeking mode. European majors should suffer from this shift as the Swiss franc loses its safe haven luster and sterling loses investors seeking safety in the FTSE.    GBP/USD tried to add to Friday's recovery from a 3-week low of 1.4110 but only reached a high of 1.4218, lower than Friday's high of 1.4230. Cable subsequently fell back to a day's low of 1.4159, just above support seen at 1.4150. Resistance eyed at 1.4180 and 1.4230. A break of 1.4110 would put 1.4045 under pressure and be seen as a bearish signal.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Markets hope that Japanese government will present to American counterparts a concrete proposal how to deal with bad loans issue and deflation, but many believe that the plan will be a disappointment. Traders expect that PM Koizumi will emphasize that yen should be left to markets and Bush is likely to defend strong dollar policy. The yen was hurt after Japanese Financial Services Minister Yanagisawa said that the government is not going to save banking system loaded with trillions of bad loans, which further sparked pessimism about the future economic outlook. But Economic Minister Takenaka said the government should disclose the results from inspection of bank's bad loans prior to March 31 ( the end of fiscal year in Japan). Takenaka added that it is possible that the government will inject public funds into banks by March 31 to help them refill their capital. As of September 30, bad loans totaled 37.4 bln yen. On Friday, Japanese bankruptcies ballooned to a record level of 19.3% but the yen benefited by downward pressure on the dollar, as well as yen repatriation ahead of the fiscal year book closings on March 31. USD/JPY support is seen at the 132-yen level, backed by 131.70 and 131.20. Upside capped at 133.0, 133.35/40 and 133.70.  EUR/USD is trading around 87.30 as the sentiment towards the single currency turned negative on apprehension that Eurozone inflation in January is likely to be revised higher after data from Portugal, Greece and Germany showed that consumer prices rose respectively to 3.5%, 4.4%, and 2.3% y/y in January. The rise in inflation diminishes the European Central Bank's inclination to lower rates in the near-term, even though growth in the Eurozone continues to be sluggish. Finally, the euro may be supported ahead of the US holiday weekend on short covering. Resistance is seen at 87.50, followed by 88.20 and the 200-day moving average at 88.50. Key support holds at 86.80, 86.45/50-- the 61.8% retracement of the most recent climb starting on Feb. 1, and 85.50.  Looking forward to this week, key US indicators consist of housing starts and permits, CPI, jobless claims, international trade, index of leading indicators, Philadelphia Fed survey and the Federal budget. Eurozone highlights include industrial production, Germany's ZEW economic sentiment survey, Italy's ISAE consumer confidence survey, Spanish GDP, German PPI, German import prices, German CPI, Italian industrial orders, Euroarea balance of payments, Euroarea foreign trade, French GDP, Italian CPI and Spanish CPI.

"(NMS 02-73) REMINDER -- Timely Allocation of Trades","Notice to Members #02-73
March 14, 2002


To:	All NYMEX Division Members, Member Firms and Floor Clerks
	All NYMEX Division Clearing Members

From:	J. Robert Collins, President

Re:	REMINDER -- Timely Allocation of Trades



	Please be reminded that, pursuant to NYMEX Rule 9.04(M)(2), Clearing
Procedure, all trades executed on the NYMEX Division Trading Floor must be
allocated within one hour after the Exchange supplies the initial transfer
information.  A Floor Member is required to submit all transfer information,
including a customer account number, clearing member number and customer
type indicator code to the Clearing Member within this time period.  Timely
trade transfer information is extremely relevant for all Clearing Members
for the purpose of risk management.

Floor Members

	The Compliance Review Committee has been working with the Compliance
Depart-ment on a program for attaining compliance with this requirement.
Commencing on Monday, March 18, for the week ending March 15, 2002,
Compliance Staff will be issuing weekly advisory notices to Floor Members
who fail to allocate at least 75% of their transactions within one hour, as
required by Rule 9.04(M)(2).  We hope that this program, utilizing the
advisories, will alert Floor Members to allocation problems and effectively
achieve acceptable timely allocations prior to the formal implementation of
any other disciplinary action.

Clearing Members

	Floor Members have pointed out that trades cannot be allocated in a
timely fashion if incomplete information is relayed by the customer at the
time of order placement.  We are, therefore, requesting that Clearing
Members remind their customers that account information must be supplied to
the Floor Member promptly in order to ensure that trades are allocated in a
timely fashion.

* * * * * * * * * * *

	Any questions or problems should be brought to the attention of
either David Schneiderman, Director, Trade Practice, at 299-2857, or Russell
Cloughen, Associate Director, Trade Practice, at 299-2880.

The yen is little changed vs. the dollar trading around 132.65, after markets got little direction from Bush-Koizumi meeting. All eyes are on Bush's speech at Diet (Parliament) at 11:30 PM EST. In a speech he will deliver to the Diet U.S. President will likely state strong hopes that Japan will regain a competitive edge and will indicate Japan's prospective to achieve high economic growth. The yen briefly hit 132.90 against the dollar on gaff by President Bush that he had discussed ""devaluation"" with Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi. Not long afterwards, the yen corrected against the greenback once it was discovered that President Bush had confused the term devaluation with deflation. The two leaders also spoke about the problems facing Japan's economy, such as deflation and bad loans, and structural reforms to address those problematic areas. Koizumi once again vowed to stave off a financial crisis, while defending his administration by saying that reform measures could not be accomplished in only one year. Three economic ministers expressed their disapproval with injections of public funds into banks actually seeing no need to dismiss worries about policy confusion inside the cabinet during Bush's visit. Government officials were concerned that the disagreement about financial system stability would negatively affect the Japan-U.S. relationship. Finance Minster Shiokawa, who first hinted at the option of mandatory public fund injunctions, said he shares the same opinion with Yanagisawa. Support stands at 132.40, 132.0 and 131.70. Resistance is eyed at 133.0, 133.35/40 and 133.70.  EUR/USD is trading around just above 87 cents, sparked by Bundesbank's head Welteke confidence that the Germany economy would recover this year. Welteke explained that a German upturn in 2002 would arise from a fall in inflation, low interest rates and exports, helped as well by the end of the inventory liquidation and weakness in construction. Earlier in trading, the single currency was hurt by a report from the Swedish government warning that the Eurozone may not be a stable ""hard currency"" area, nor a low inflation and low interest rate environment as many are hoping. In addition, traders are anxious ahead of tomorrow's Eurozone industrial production data. Support is viewed at 86.80 and 86.45/50. Resistance is seen at 87.50, followed by 88.20 and the 200-day moving average at 88.50.  This week's key US indicators consist of housing starts and permits, CPI, jobless claims, international trade, index of leading indicators, Philadelphia Fed survey and the Federal budget. Eurozone highlights include industrial production, Germany's ZEW economic sentiment survey, German GDP, Italy's ISAE consumer confidence survey, Spanish GDP, German CPI, Italian industrial orders, Euroarea balance of payments, Euroarea foreign trade, French GDP, Italian CPI and Spanish CPI. Major data releases from the UK comprise money supply, balance of trade, Bank of England's MPC minutes, and the CBI Industrial Trends survey. Key economic indicators from Japan are general household spending and the index of tertiary sector activity.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Current account surplus 2.9% of GDP in Oct-Dec Japan says govt 1% FY GDP forecast needs outcome of +1.6% in Jan-March Japan says calendar 2001 GDP down real 0.5% y/y Recent changes in the law concerning the short-selling of stocks, as well as increasing confidence of a US-led global economic recovery spurred the re-allocation of assets from the US to Japan and other markets. In addition, rumors that the Bank of Japan was in the market also fueled the currency's rise, in spite of warnings from the MoF's Kuroda and Muto that Japan would be monitoring for speculative and excessive moves. There is a possibility that MoF could warn of possible intervention if the yen continues to strengthen. Foreigners bought a net 114-bln yen in Japanese shares last week, the biggest amount in seven weeks. The currency also strengthened due to repatriation talks ahead of March 31, the end of fiscal year in Japan. For the past five weeks, Japanese investors have been net sellers of foreign securities. Japan's January index of leading economic indicators in January stood at 75.0, above the 50 mark, assuming the economy may hit bottom and improve in coming months. The lagging indicator for January came in at 16.7, while the coincident indicator was 33.3.Rating agency Fitch IBCA said Japan's near-term sovereign risks are small for government bonds and other debt securities issued or guaranteed by the government. The firm currently rates Japanese long-term bonds double A. But Fitch remains bearish, saying Japan's massive fiscal deficit remains on an ""unsustainable medium-term path."" PM Koizumi promised on Thursday to take all required steps to revive Japan's sagging economy, but added there are no ''quick fixes.'' ''There is no change in my policy that the economy will not recover without reform and to promote structural reforms,'' Koizumi said. Resistance seen at 128 and 128.50. Support at 127 and at the 200-day moving average of 125.0.  EUR/USD is trading around 88.10 after reaching a 1-1/2 month high of 88.39 cents, shrugging off the European Central Bank's decision this morning to keep rates steady at 3.25%. Markets had anticipated the central bank would take no action due to growing signs of Eurozone economic recovery and rising inflationary pressures. ECB President Duisenberg repeated that he expects inflation to fall below 2% ""in the course of the coming months"", helped by falling producer prices that will be reflected in CPI, and by moderation in M3 components. Nonetheless, he warned that for inflation to stay below its limit would depend on wage moderation, which is crucial to growth in jobs and stable prices. EUR/USD faces resistance at its 200-day moving average of 88.50. Next upward target is seen at 89.0 and 89.40. Support is viewed at 87.40, backed by 87.0 and 86.65.  The pound gained a cent to peak at a 1-1/2 week high of 1.4313 against the dollar, after dropping to a 2-session low of 1.4184 cents in reaction to the Bank of England's expected decision to keep rates unchanged at 4.0% this morning. On its part, the IMF recommended the Bank of England should be ready to adjust monetary policy in either direction, noting the need to monitor escalating home prices and consumer debt. The IMF forecasted UK growth in 2002 at 1.8%, noting the slowdown would be brief but subject to risks. Next key upward target is seen at the 200-day moving average of 1.4333, followed by 1.4370 and 1.440. Support holds at 1.420, 1.4170 and 1.4130.  In his testimony to the House of Representative, Greenspan altered his speech slightly as he stated that the US economic expansion is ""well underway  and that an array of influences unique to the current cycle are likely to moderate their pace. He indicated encouraging signs that demand trends are strengthening but the size of the pickup is uncertain, especially since business investment elsewhere, including aircraft, will most likely remain weak. Thus he commented that a US recovery almost certainly would not match the average growth of past recessions, which have typically averaged around 7%.  Tomorrow's release of the key US employment labor report is expected to show the creation of 5K to 10K in non-farm payrolls, though some private forecasts expect the creation of 100K. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 5.8% from 5.6%, while average hourly earnings are seen up 0.3% from 0.0%.Key Eurozone indicators include Italian GDP and Dutch CPI. Highlights from Japan comprise GDP, money supply and wholesale prices.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  February 20, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8700 $/JPY..133.77 GBP/$..1.4271 $/CHF..1.6997  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  by Darko Pavlovic  At 6:50:00 PM Japan Dec Tertiary Index (exp -1.5%, prev 1.7%) Japan Dec All ind. index (exp -0.5%, prev 0.4%)  The dollar is likely to test 134 yen on Tokyo's Thursday trading following the rise in US stocks and optimism about the world's biggest economy.  In Asian trading, the Japanese currency had risen on reports that Bank of Japan Governor Hayami had asked Prime Minister Koizumi to consider injecting public funds into the ailing banking sector, although government spokesman Fukuda later denied. Markets will eye speech from former finance minister for international affairs Sakakibara alias Mr. Yen for his most of the times accurate predictions about the economic outlook. The speech is due at 1:00 AM EST. Japan Dec all industries activity index rose 1% from the previous month. The core component of tertiary sector index rose 0.7%. For the Oct-Dec quarter the all industries index fell 0.7% from the previous quarter. The tertiary index was up 0.1% In the immediate-term, the yen's losses are likely to be limited by repatriation before the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31, after which point, the currency is seen to tumble further in the absence of crucial reform initiatives. The mid sized builder company Haseko's shares had been temporarily suspended in Tokyo trading after media reports that the company will ask creditors to covert 150 bln yen in debt to equity. The lower house Budget Committee will hold public hearings on the fiscal 2002 budget next week, clearing the way for the budget's passage in the full lower house as early as March 5. Subsequent to passage in the lower house, the government and the coalition parties expect to have the full upper house approve the fiscal 2002 budget on about March 20. The January consumer sentiment index rose 5.4 points from the previous month to -31.2, its first improvement in two months. Of respondents, 9.5% reported improved circumstances, up 2.4 pts from December, and 40.7% reported a worsening in their financial state, down 3.0 pts. The BoJ Hayami was reluctant on Feb. 15 meeting to increase its outright monthly govt. bond purchases due to negative side effects on long term rates. The Finance Minister Shiokawa has frequently said he would like the BOJ increase its JGB buys to Y1.0 trillion from the current Y800 billion. Resistance is eyed at 134.0, 134.45 and 134.85. Support holds at 133.20, 133.0 and 132.50.  EUR/USD is trading just below 87 cents as the euro failed to profit on stronger than expected Italian ISAE Consumer Confidence Survey which gained 1.6 points to 126, showing that customers felt the most optimistic in 12 years since unemployment has been falling. Market participants believe that Euroarea consumption will have to replace weak business spending in order to avoid a recession in the Eurozone. The ISAE commented that consumers were ""more positive about the near-term prospects for the economy"", adding that they did not anticipate significant inflationary pressures. Support is viewed at 86.80, 86.45/50 and 86.10. Resistance is seen at 87.85, 88.10 and the 200-day moving average at 88.5  Cable fell after Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee meeting minutes showed that two of the nine members voted in favor of a 25-bp rate cut. Markets wait for tomorrow's release of UK retail sales that are expected to edge up 0.6% m/m or 5.8% y/y in January. The pound could renew its climb should the data show strong levels of consumption that would induce the central bank to raise interest rates. Support stands at 1.4225, 1.420 and 1.4150. Upside capped at 1.4340, 1.4365 and 1.440.  Markets will first assess tomorrow's US international trade balance, which is expected to widen to  28.3 billion in December from the previous deficit of  27.8 billion as sluggish global demand takes its toll on US exports.Then traders will look at tomorrow morning's release of the Index of Leading Indicators that is forecasted to post a more moderate gain to 0.5% in January from the previous increase of 1.2% due to improvements in jobless claims and in the ISM manufacturing survey.    This week's other key US indicators consist of jobless claims, Philadelphia Fed survey and the Federal budget. Eurozone highlights include German CPI, Italian industrial orders, Euroarea balance of payments, Euroarea foreign trade, French GDP, Italian CPI and Spanish CPI. The last data release from the UK this week is the CBI Industrial Trends survey. The remaining economic indicator from Japan is the index of tertiary sector activity.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Trade (exp -28.8 bln, prev -29.4 bln) At 9:45:00 AM US Jan Univ of Michigan Sent prel (exp 89.3, prev 88.8)  The dollar held onto its gains on Friday, going into the US session up about one percent against the majors since Monday. USD rose steadily despite a roughshod week on Wall Street that fluctuated with the mixed data and sentiment. The Dow fell nearly 300 points by mid-week before rallying overnight on more upbeat data and earnings announcements after Wednesday's sell-off.  In Tokyo trade, USD/JPY surprised the market with a rally to a 1-week high of 133.03 after holding above support at 132.40 overnight. The move bodes well for a resumption of its rally after a weeklong decline stabilized around 131.80 on Tuesday as corrective yen buying slowed. USD is now targeting last week's 3-year high of 133.37. Support is seen at 132.40 and 131.80, the 61.8% and 38.2% Fibonacci retracements of the move from 133.37 to this week's low of 130.85. Resistance is seen at last week's 3-year high of 133.37 and only a break of this level is seen bringing back the bull, dealers say.  EUR/JPY regained the 117 level after hitting an overnight low of 116.01. Again, moves in the JPY will be important to watch as most of EUR/USD losses on Tuesday and Wednesday came on the back of a steep fall in EUR/JPY to a low of 115.67 from a high of 119.37 last week, or a 3% drop. Since EUR/JPY rise was steeper than that of USD/JPY there was a steeper reversal. Support is now seen at 116.50 followed by key support at 115.60. Resistance is seen at 117.00 and 117.50. A close above 116.50 will be needed in order to maintain its bullish momentum, dealers say.  Overnight comments from Japan's PM Koizumi and FinMin Shiokawa showed their reluctance to talk about the yen, except to say that it was for markets to determine the appropriate levels. However, BoJ Governor Hayami interjected that no central bank likes a weak currency and that it was important for Japan to maintain a strong yen. Hayami also said other central banks have questioned Japan's yen stance, but that the BoJ is not tolerating a weak yen, nor the MoF. These remarks failed to stem the yen's fall as markets see further weakness ahead for the JPY ahead of painful reforms.  EUR/USD hovered in a tight 20 pip range around 88 cents as lack of European data kept currencies movements to a minimum in London trade. Markets are also eyeing this morning's US economic data as well as a key meeting between representatives of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and the US Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs Taylor to discuss the consequences of a strong dollar. Therefore, dealers were careful not to get to enthusiastic about the dollar ahead of today's meeting given that when this happened last July, USD fell because the administration appeared uncertain over the strong dollar policy.  NAM Vice President Vargo argues that the strong dollar policy is hurting US exports and slowing down the recovery of the US economy. Vargo thinks that the dollar is currently overvalued because of its strength against the major currencies in spite of the US slowdown. However, manufacturers are unlikely to get the US administration to change its policy given the need to continue to finance the US current account deficit with foreign inflows of capital. A fall in USD would stem that flow. Moreover, the US administration is expected to continue to let JPY fall in order to keep Japan from falling into a deflationary spiral as many economists fear.  In fact, the first data to be released today is the international trade figures for November. The large deficit is expected to fall slightly, as it usually does in a recession, to 28.8 from 29.4 billion. Like past recessions, imports are expected to decrease faster than exports as a consequence of the global slowdown.   Markets will be more interested in knowing how the consumer perceives the economic outlook and the University of Michigan's confidence survey is forecasted to rise to 89.3 in the preliminary January reading from the previous 88.8. This would be the fourth consecutive gain, but today's consumer sentiment data isn't expected to move markets unless it surprises on the up or downside.  Meanwhile, the majority of major earnings announcements came to pass this week. Overnight, Microsoft saw strong sales that topped Wall Street expectations, prompting a rebound in US stocks. Positive earnings from Citigroup, Compaq, General Electric, Apple Computer and Sears, as well as the rebound in the Philadelphia Fed survey pushed the Dow up by 1.4% or 137 points to 9850 and NASDAQ by 2% or 41 points to 1985. But US stock futures look poised to spoil those gains with Dow down 59 and Nasdaq down 25. Today's key release includes Sun Microsystems which is expected to show a small loss in Q4.  GBP/USD fell to key support around 1.4330 in European trade after plunging to a 5-week low of 1.4300 overnight. But losses were mitigated by sterling's strength against the euro, which was trading near an overnight 3-week low near 61.20 pence. Since EMU mania subsided EUR/GBP is now back to trading around Jan 1 levels. However, cable's position will remain weak if it cannot maintain above 1.4440 after it fell from last Monday's 2-week high of 1.4513, a 2-cent drop in 4 days. Resistance is seen at 1.4390, 1.4440, 1.4480, 1.450 and 1.4550. Key support at 1.4330, the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 1.4060 to 1.4606. A break of that level would call upon 1.43 on its way to 1.4267, the 61.8% retracement of the same move.  USD/CHF fully recovered from Wednesday's 1% sell off to a low of 1.6445. Swissy regained support at 1.6540 and successfully broke back through resistance at 1.6680 on its way to a day's high of 1.6702 in London trade. Gains are seen capped at this week's high of 1.6730, which marks the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 1.6955 to 1.6355. Support is seen at 1.6540 and 1.6510. Major trendline support is seen at 1.6460.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's        Interest Rates  US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%        [IMAGE]   	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview January 9, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8916 $/JPY..133.02 GBP/$..1.4384 $/CHF..1.6569  Japanese Forex Trading Preview by Darko Pavlovic  No key data.   USD/JPY is trading near its three years high around 133.15 boosted by fresh comments from Economic Minister Takenaka who said currency levels should be left to the markets, sparking a new yen sell. Takenaka is currently in the US and markets are looking for any indication from Washington that will tolerate further yen weakness. The yen retraced off its 3 year lows after Japan's chief government spokesman Fukuda, said the currency's 9% drop against the dollar during the past two months was   a bit rapid.'' Fukuda's comments raised speculation the government would try to slow the decline, ahead of Prime Minister Koizumi's trip to Southeast Asia. Japanese officials are in favor of a weaker yen to increase exports and help draw the economy out of recession. Officials from South Korea's Finance and Economic Ministry who expressed his discontent with the weakening in the yen because it created depression in other Asian markets. The BoJ is likely to adopt asset-backed commercial paper as a tool in its open-market operations when they meet next Tuesday and Wednesday. The BoJ wants to raise wariness about credit risk that could start to arise in late March, the end of fiscal year in Japan. A total of 22 third-sector companies went bankrupt in calendar 2001, most of them in regional tourism and leisure industries. Koizumi left Japan on Wednesday morning for a weeklong tour of five Southeast Asian nations, which include Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore and deliver a speech on Japan's Southeast Asia policy in Singapore. According to the Ministry of  Telecommunications Japan will be able to create 1.85 million jobs by 2005. Resistance is seen at 133.40 and 134.50. Support is viewed at 132.20, 131.50 and 131.0.   The euro is trading around 89.15 after falling to a one and a half week lows of 88.66 after Eurozone business climate fell to a 5-1/2 year low of -1.23 in December from -1.20 in Nov. The greater-than-expected upward revision in Q3 labor costs and earnings to 3.3% from the previous 2.7% was also cause for concern. Finally, German Chancellor Schroeder's statement that the German government would soon announce measures to promote low wage job creation without hurting deficit goals worked more to undermine the euro than shore up the currency. The single currency benefited from fall in the US stocks, which retreated into negative territory late in the trading session on a combination of rumors and a large sell-order. The Dow fell 56 points to 10094 and NASDAQ finishing down 10 points to 2044. For most of the day, equities had been boosted by Cisco's announcement that it anticipated an increase in its market share and planned to make acquisitions to diversify its product line. Upbeat outlooks from Oracle and Coach also helped lift shares. Initial support is seen at 89.0, backed by 88.80 and 88.60. Upside capped at 89.55, 89.80 and 90.0.  The Federal Reserve is planned to meet for its monetary policy meeting on January 29-30 in the peak of earnings season. While there are some bears who expect gloomy results in the first quarter compared with the previous one, other investors are bullish about the equity markets' outlook given that so far earnings expectations have been fairly optimistic.  This week's major US indicators comprise jobless claims, import and export prices, wholesale trade and PPI. Key Eurozone economic releases include Euroarea GDP, ECB monthly bulletin, German industrial production, German foreign trade, Spanish industrial production, Dutch manufacturing production, French GDP, French current account, French CPI, Dutch CPI and Spanish CPI. Highlights from Japan consist of wholesale prices, money supply and the ESRI Tokyo consumer sentiment survey. The major event of this week will be the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting on Thursday, although no rate cut is expected.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   2.5%  0.15%  3.75%  4.5%  1.75-2.75%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  October 22, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8914 $/JPY..122.36 GBP/$..1.4244 $/CHF..1.6590  Japanese Forex Trading Preview by Darko Pavlovic  No key data.   The dollar rose to a nine week high vs. the yen and six week high vs. the euro, lifted by the rise in US stock market and optimism that the economy will rebound due to aggressive Fed rate cuts this year. The euro fell to $0.8897 against the dollar, weakened by last Friday's release of the German Ifo survey which tumbled to an 8-year low of 95.0 from 89.5 in its largest drop in 28 years. Today a number of German institutes admitted their conviction that Germany is on the brink of a recession and therefore they lowered the GDP forecasts for 2001 to 0.7% from 2.1% and for 2002 to 1.3% from 2.2%. The institutes also slashed Eurozone growth estimates for 2001 to 1.5% from 2.6% and for 2002 to 1.8% from 2.6%. In conclusion, the German institutes supported the ECB to cut rates by 25-bp to lower their rates to 3.5% by the end of the year in order to redress the economic contraction in the European nations. The euro will likely come under intense pressure this week due to market consternation that the European Central Bank is unlikely cut rates at their monetary policy meeting this Thursday. Finally, Welteke stated that the ECB does not pursue an exchange rate goal but rather stability, adding that central bankers ""always like a strong external"" exchange rate. Welteke remarked that the euro was undervalued and said the dollar and the pound are probably overvalued. Support is viewed at 89.0, 88.50 and 88.15. Resistance is seen at 90.20, 90.80 and 91.20.  The yen fell to a 9-week low of 122.58, amid pessimism towards Japan's economy after the release of two pieces of data that confirmed the deterioration in the Japanese economy. The tertiary sector index fell to -0.1% in August, as the all industries index also registered in negative territory at -0.2% and thus suggested GDP would be poor. Japan's trade surplus also declined 43.1% y/y to 3.305 trillion yen. Both pieces of data caused markets to refocus on Japan's weak fundamentals, which will put downward pressure on the yen in the near-term. The BoJ branch managers warned that regional economic situation in worsening led by slowdown in production and exports on capital spending, employment and income. The September 11 terrorist attack and mad cow disease have emerged as new factors weighting on the economy. Finance Minister Shiokawa said he will consider the proposal from New Komeito to reduce the amount of inheritance tax on smaller firms. Under new proposal, inheritors of small and midsize companies would pay only 50% of the tax on company assets such as land, buildings and machinery if they continue the business for five years. The FSA urged major banks to boost their capital and increase management transparency. The Resolution and Collection Corp. paid 1 yen per loan for 53.5% of the bad loans bought from city banks and others as of Sept 30. Since the RCC mostly pay below the market price, banks usually bring the loans they already gave up completely. Upside capped at 122.70, 123.0 and 123.30. Support stands at 121.20, 121.0 and 120.80.  The pound dropped over one cent to a fresh 9-week low of 1.4213 against the broadly stronger dollar rather than on intrinsic weakness in the UK currency as it traded near its session high of .6240 against the euro. Resistance is eyed at 1.4325, 1.4350 and 1.4420. Support stands at 1.4250, 1.4215 and 1.4185. The Swiss franc hit a 5-week low of 1.6640 against the dollar, but pared some loses in reaction of another confirmed anthrax case and possible anthrax-related fatalities. Upside capped at 1.6615, 1.6640 and 1.6670. Support holds at 1.6440, 1.6410 and 1.6380.  Dow Jones rose nearly 1.9% or 172 points to 9377, boosted by the better-than-expected earnings reports from 3M. NASDAQ rose by 2.2% or 36 points to 1708, as traders await reports from semiconductor firms Altera Corp. and Vitesse Semiconductor Corp after the closing bell, and other bellwethers like Compaq tomorrow.  The major indicators due from the US this week include the Employment Cost Index, durable goods, existing and new home sales, and the University of Michigan Confidence Survey. From the Eurozone, key data due for release are German PPI, Italian CPI, ISAE Industrial and Consumer Confidence Survey, French CPI, Italian Foreign trade, Euroarea M3 data and foreign trade. Markets await the ECB rate announcement on Thursday October 25, even though the central bank is unlikely to ease monetary policy. Noteworthy data from the UK comprise the CBI Industrial Trends Survey and Q3 GDP. Highlights from Japan consist of corporate service prices, consumer prices and commercial sales.

Event New York Fed Pres McDonough to speak at 1:15 PM, Minneapolis Fed Pres Stern to speak at 4:00 PM.  USD started the week lower across the board following the Asian markets reaction to last Friday's comments by Fed Chairman Greenspan, where he pointed out that the optimistic view of economy has not yet been reflected in the real fundamentals. Therefore, markets are wondering whether earnings warnings this week will depress Wall Street after US equities ended a down week on a down note on Friday. Signals from Greenspan is that it's no shoe in that the economy will come out of the slowdown and return to fast growth also mean that markets will look to this week's US data for hints as to the Fed's next move at its monetary policy meeting on January 30.  EUR/USD rose to a day's high of 89.53 before paring gains in European trade to a day's low of 89.22. Weakness against the pound and yen weighed on the EUR/USD rate as the single currency tested support at 61.50 pence and 117.35 yen.  The euro barely held above last Friday's low of 117.25 and failure to hold above 117.50 could be a bearish sign for the euro, especially since much of the euro's recent strength against the dollar has been derived from its strong gains against the yen. However, further weakness is not seen unless EUR/USD falls below support at 89.10.  EUR/USD continues to move within a channel from 88.70 to 89.50 as it hovers around the key 89.10 level, which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. This level is significant in that it reflects an equilibrium in supply and demand condition between euro and dollar. Today, the pair briefly tested resistance at 89.50, but was rejected. Moves higher are not seen by the market as indicating strength given the euro's difficulty to remain above 90-cents.  Given the mixed data from the Euro area and the US, investors are seen waiting on the sidelines ahead of the latest round of earnings reports from the US for better direction. Dealers will watch to see if U.S. markets are getting ahead of themselves in anticipating a U.S. recovery, meaning that share prices may be overvalued. Until we see corporate earnings improving, share prices aren't likely to rise. Moreover, companies are likely to put all their bad news into Q4 reports for a clean slate in 2002, stock analyst say.  On Friday, Greenspan said a key feature of the recent downturn was a lack of business investment. He said that when it does recover, spending will not resume at breakneck speed. Instead, the present cycle will be driven by a return of corporate profits and capital investment. But those levels aren't expected to reach the levels it did in 1999 and early 2000 when companies were preparing for the Y2K date change and spending large amounts of money on IT investment. This chimed with Richmond Fed president Broaddus who said last week ""there's a good chance that the US economy may be at least a little softer than the consensus"" expectations and predicted ""a more gradual recovery from the recession than in most other post-war business cycles.   Although a restrained economic assessment by Greenspan initially weighed on the dollar, markets may interpret it as slowing the recovery in the euro area as well, which would weigh on the euro.  Sterling rose to a day's high of $1.4505 continued to trade near a day's high of 61.55 pence despite November industrial production, which fell more than expected at -0.7% m/m and -5.4% y/y. The manufacturing numbers were disappointing , but not surprising given the attention paid to the UK's ""two speed"" economy which BoE officials have spoken of in the past. The data confirms the recessionary state of the sector.   GBP was supported by weekend comments from PM Blair concerning EMU entry. Blair's cautionary remark that there must be an examination of the economic benefits of joining the euro before his government could recommend membership helped push EUR/GBP to a low of 61.55. GBP is now close to its 2001 opening level around 61 pence after falling as far as 62.80 at the start of the year. GBP/USD resistance is seen at 1.450 and 1.4550. Support holds at 1.4370, 1.4340 and 1.4320.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt. Analysis BoE inaction Lifts GBP, Comments Hurt CHF        Articles & Ideas  Greenspan Widens Door for One More, But...

(1)  I thought you said that there were specific transactions in the U.S. entities.  I need a list of trades booked in the names of Enron Credit Inc. and Enron North America Corp.

(2)  I need someone to walk me through the numbers appearing on the charts which you sent me.

(3)  I don't understand what happened with the Anker Coal position.  I know that London used that entity for the purpose of transferring this position to ECTEF Inc.

I have not received anything from anyone in London or anywhere else regarding positions, etc.

I did speak with a Weil bankruptcy lawyer and there were many issues especially with respect to ENA positions (and I don't know where the high value credit positions are booked).  They believe that we may have structuring issues working through London and not directly with a purchaser.

Can you send the information over here?

"(01-386) Copper and Aluminum Options Expiration Operational Proce	dures","Notice No. 01-386
November 20, 2001


TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing
Members - Shortened Hours
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the December 2001 options contract for Copper (HXZ1)
and Aluminum (OAZ1) is Tuesday, November 27, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


The following schedule of operational procedures is based on the recently
announced shortened trading hours.

Trading in the December 2001 Copper and Aluminum Options Contracts will
cease at 1:00 P.M. and 1:10 p.m. respectively on November 27, 2001.  All
Brokers and Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions
to exercise or abandon such Options by 3:00 P.M.

On Tuesday, November 27, 2001, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special ""OLTE"" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Tuesday's submissions and processing will be
available on Wednesday morning November 28, 2001.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
(""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

   Sara,

   Per your conversation with Phil Levy, attached please find our proposed
   amendment to the Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement currently
   in
   place between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.  I
   have reviewed the definition of ""Specified Swap"" as defined in Part 1(2)
   of
   the Schedule and it does not appear to include foreign exchange
   transactions.  Therefore, I have modified the definition in the
   amendment.

   Please review the amendment and, if satisfactory, arrange for the
   execution
   of two copies.  Both copies should then be returned to my attention at
   270
   Park Avenue, 40th Floor, New York, New York 10017.  In addition, once
   executed, I would appreciate your faxing me a copy at 212-270-7368.
   Once I
   receive the originals and have them executed by Chase, I will return to
   you
   one fully executed original for your files.

   If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.  My
   telephone number is 212-270-2673.

      Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
      amending
      the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

      Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose
   the
      language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

      I trust this will now close the open issues.

      I look forward to hearing from you

      Kind regards

      Daniel:

      Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
      relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.
      If
      you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
   and
      we
      can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber
   of
      Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime
      brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore,
      are
      not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do have
      other
      business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
      limitation
      of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

      ""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or
   from
      any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect,
   special,
      punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage.""

      Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of
   the
      office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

      All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
      executed
      together with the terms of business letter.

      Regards.  Sara

         Sara

         The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
      relationship
         with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues that
      relate
         to
         the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects with
   the
      PB
         relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

         Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately
         addressed
         in the documentation as drafted.

         I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as
   possible
      so
         we
         can try to get this wrapped up today.

         Kind regards

         Daniel:

         Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the PB
         conflict
         because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with
   Par.8
         requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the
      Terms
         of
         Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts
   prevail.
         Are
         you agreeing with this analysis?

         Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to
   conflict
         with
         the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the
   PB
         (except
         for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It is
      Enron
         Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit
   the
         Terms
         of Business in the same manner.

         Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
      suggest a
         different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the the
         remaining
         documents.

         Thanks.

            Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke.
   Arbitration -
         more
            appropriate to general terms of business which principally
         contemplate
            the
            regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the

      of

            I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

            Daniel:

            Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
      ""Agreement"")
            with my colleague Angela Davis.

            I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter
         relating
            to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we
   discussed
      but
            were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

            (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par.
   14
      of
            the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the possible
   use
      of
            arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in
   the
         OSLA)
            so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of
      the
            Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to
   English
         courts,
            I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which
   will
            prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

            (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
      manner
         as
            Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe
   that
      you
            and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
      shouldn't
            these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

            I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of
   the
            account documentation.  Regards.

December 26, 2001

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:	J. ROBERT COLLINS, JR., PRESIDENT

RE:		EXCHANGE TO EXTEND NATURAL GAS TRADING HOURS TOMORROW

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will extend trading in its natural
gas futures and options contracts to 2:45 PM from their regular closing time
of 2:30 PM. in response to a change in schedule, due to the holidays, of the
release by the American Gas Association (AGA) of results of its weekly
storage survey report.

The rescheduling of the announcement coincides with the expiration of the
January natural gas futures contract.  The Exchange had previously announced
that trading in natural gas futures and options will be extended until 2:45
whenever the expiration of natural gas futures occurs on a Wednesday, the
regular release date of the AGA report.

"Changes are afoot","Dear Sara,
Our upcoming exhibition of Kirk Hayes' wonderful paintings 
(his first show in Houston) will mark our 25th anniversary, 
and it will also be our final exhibition in Houston ! 
 
Early this summer, Gary and I will move the gallery and our residence 
to southern Arizona.  We've had a wonderful 25+ year run in Houston 
and we're sad to be leaving our many friends and supporters, 
but new adventures beckon.  We're looking forward to many visitors 
once we get settled.  More details to follow regarding our new location, etc.... 
Our final schedule is as follows-
14 Artists  through February 23
FotoFest: Doherty, Sparagana & Stautberg  March 1-30
Our 25th anniversary Swansong event- 
Kirk Hayes: new paintings  April 5-May 4

Let me know if there's anything you can't (or shouldn't) live without.    
Best, Kathleen

"(02-68) Request for assistance in communicating the importance of	 the weekly natural gas storage report to the Department of Energy","
Notice #  02-68
March 5,  2002
 
To:               All  NYMEX Division Members
                    NYMEX Division Member Firms
 
From:          J. Robert Collins, Jr., President
 
 
Re:        Request for assistance in communicating the importance of the  weekly natural gas storage report to the Department of  Energy
 
 
The U.S. Department of  Energy Energy Information Administration (EIA) will take over the release of the  weekly natural gas storage report from the American Gas Association this  spring.  Since its inception in  1993, the survey has been an important source of on-going changes in the supply  and demand of natural gas, and plays an important role in the transparency of  the market.  While at the present  time the report is released during open outcry trading hours, the Exchange has  reason to believe that the EIA is leaning toward releasing the numbers in the  late afternoon or on the weekend.   Officials at the EIA have said they believe this will minimize the  volatility in the marketplace.
 
It is the firm belief of the  Exchange that releasing the weekly storage report in the off-hours will only  increase market volatility upon the resumption of open outcry trading, will  limit market transparency, and would put many market participants at a  disadvantage.  In the interests of  market transparency and fairness, the Exchange is concerned that the report be  released during open outcry trading hours when the market is most liquid, and  has suggested a time of 10:30 A.M. 
 
The Exchange has made  its position known in written comments to the Department of Energy.  EIA Administrator Mary Hutzler has said  that the Exchange appears to be the only interested party that feels strongly  about releasing the data during regular trading hours. 
 
It is important that market  participants, particularly commercial entities, contact the EIA on this  issue.  I urge you and your  customers to call Ms. Hutzler, (202) 586-6351, and cordially explain how  important it is to have the information made available during regular daytime  trading hours, preferably 10:30 A.M.  Please make the following  points:
 
?  The weekly inventory report is an  important source of information regarding changes in the supply and demand of  natural gas.  It is currently  released to coincide with regular daytime trading hours of the natural gas  futures market. 
 
?  Wide participation in the New York  Mercantile Exchange natural gas futures market by commercial buyers and sellers  from all segments of the industry has made the futures contract the North  American pricing benchmark.
 
?  The release of the report in the late in  the afternoon, or early in the morning when the trading floor is closed, will  put most market participants at a distinct disadvantage to those firms who have  trading desks manned round the clock.
 
?  The release of the information in the  off hours could also increase volatility at the opening of the market -- having  the opposite of the desired effect.
 
?  In the interests of fairness and market  transparency, it is vital that the statistics continue to be released according  to current practice, during daytime trading; one of the most active times of the  day is shortly after the market open, or about 10:30 A.M.        
 
If you prefer to fax Ms.  Hutzler at (202) 586-0329, or email mary.hutzler@eia.doe.gov, we have provided  the following recommended language:
 
 
Ms. Mary  Hutzler
Administrator  
Energy Information  Administration
U.S. Department of Energy  
Washington, DC  
 
Dear Ms.  Hutzler:
 
Since its inception in 1993,  the American Gas Association's weekly inventory survey has been an important  source of on-going changes in the supply and demand of natural gas, and has  fulfilled an important role in assuring the transparency of the market.  We understand that the reporting  function will be assumed by the Energy Information Administration this spring,  and wish to urge that in the interest of market fairness and efficiency that the  weekly report continue to be released during regular daytime trading hours of  the natural gas futures market.
 
Wide participation in the  New York Mercantile Exchange natural gas futures market by commercial buyers and  sellers of gas from all segments of the industry has made the futures contract  the North American pricing benchmark for this important energy resource.  For this reason, we feel that it is  vital that the statistics continue to be released according to current practice,  during regular daytime trading hours, the most active trading period.  Typically, one of the most active times  of the day would be shortly after the market opens, about 10:30 A.M.  
 
A release of the inventory  figures in the late afternoon or on the weekend would primarily benefit the  major companies that can afford to man round-the-clock trading desks because  they will be able to react immediately, while smaller firms will have to wait  until the market opens on the following business day.  It has been our experience that the  release of market-moving news in the off-hours often increases market volatility  at the market open.
 
We urge you to maintain the  current practice of releasing this information during daytime  trading.
 
Thank you for your  consideration.
 
                                                                                        Sincerely,

>>Here is a great story that one of my Veteran buddies sent me this 
>>morning..... thought I would pass this along... 
>>One day, when I was a freshman in high school, I saw a kid from my 
>>class 
>>was walking home from school. His name was Kyle. It looked like 
>>he was 
>>carrying all of his books. I thought to myself, ""Why would anyone 
>>bring 
>>home all his books on a Friday? He must really be a nerd."" 
>> 
>>I had quite a weekend planned (parties and a football game with my 
>>friends tomorrow afternoon), so I shrugged my shoulders and went 
>>on. 
>> 
>>As I was walking, I saw a bunch of kids running toward him. They 
>>ran at 
>>him, knocking all his books out of his arms and tripping him so he 
>>landed in the dirt. His glasses went flying, and I saw them land 
>>in the 
>>grass about ten feet from him. He looked up and I saw this 
>>terrible 
>>sadness in his eyes. 
>> 
>>My heart went out to him. So, I jogged over to him and as he 
>>crawled 
>>around looking for his glasses, and I saw a tear in his eye. As I 
>>handed 
>> him his glasses, I said, ""Those guys are jerks. They really 
>>should get 
>>lives."" 
>>He looked at me and said, ""Hey thanks!"" There was a big smile on 
>>his 
>>face. 
>>It was one of those smiles that showed real gratitude. > 
>>I helped him pick up his books, and asked him where he lived. As 
>>it 
>>turned out, he lived near me, so I asked him why I had never seen 
>>him 
>>before. He said he had gone to private school before now. 
>>I would have never hung out with a private school kid before. We 
>>talked 
>>all the way home, and I carried some of his books. He turned out 
>>to be a 
>>pretty cool kid. I asked him if he wanted to play a little 
>>football with 
>>my friends. He said yes. We hung out all weekend and the more I 
>>got to 
>>know Kyle, the more I liked him, and my friends thought the same of 
>>him. 
>>Monday morning came, and there was Kyle with the huge stack of 
>>books 
>>again. 
>>I stopped him and said, ""Boy, you are gonna really build some 
>>serious 
>>muscles with this pile of books everyday!"" He just laughed and 
>>handed 
>>me half the books. 
>>Over the next four years, Kyle and I became best friends. When we 
>>were 
>>seniors, we began to think about college. Kyle decided on 
>>Georgetown, 
>>and I was going to Duke. I knew that we would always be friends, 
>>that 
>>the miles would never be a problem. He was going to be a doctor, 
>>and I 
>>was going for business on a football scholarship. Kyle was 
>>valedictorian of our class. 
>>I teased him all the time about being a nerd. He had to prepare a 
>>speech 
>>for graduation. I was so glad it wasn't me having to get up there 
>>and 
>>speak. Graduation day, I saw Kyle. He looked great. He was one 
>>of 
>>those guys that really found himself during high school. He filled 
>>out 
>>and actually looked good in glasses. He had more dates than I had 
>>and 
>>all the girls loved him. Boy, sometimes I was jealous. 
>>Today was one of those days. I could see that he was nervous about 
>>his 
>>speech. So, I smacked him on the back and said, ""Hey, big guy, 
>>you'll 
>>be great!"" He looked at me with one of those looks (the really 
>>grateful 
>>one) and smiled. ""Thanks,"" he said. 
>>As he started his speech, he cleared his throat, and began. 
>>""Graduation 
>>is a time to thank those who helped you make it through those tough 
>>years. Your parents, your teachers, your siblings, maybe a 
>>coach...but 
>>mostly your friends. I am here to tell all of you that being a 
>>friend to 
>>someone is the best gift you can give them. I am going to tell 
>>you a 
>>story."" 
>>I just looked at my friend with disbelief as he told the story of 
>>the 
>>first day we met. He had planned to kill himself over the weekend. 
>> He 
>>talked of how he had cleaned out his locker so his Mom wouldn't 
>>have to 
>>do it later and was carrying his stuff home. He looked hard at me 
>>and 
>>gave me a little smile. 
>>""Thankfully, I was saved. My friend saved me from doing the 
>>unspeakable."" I heard the gasp go through the crowd as this 
>>handsome, 
>>popular boy told us all about his weakest moment. I saw his Mom 
>>and dad 
>>looking at me and smiling that same grateful smile. Not until that 
>>moment did I realize it's depth. 
>>Never underestimate the power of your actions. With one small 
>>gesture 
>>you can change a person's life. For better or for worse. God puts 
>>us 
>>all in each other's lives to impact one another in some way.

[IMAGE] Forums Discuss these points in the Forums:  Forexnews Forum       Technicals Live Charts Analysis available from: Cornelius Luca   J.P. Chorek   Technical Research Ltd.   Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  European Traders Stuff Stocking With USD, Not EUR For Xmas  December 24, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8804 $/JPY..129.82 GBP/$..1.4357 $/CHF..1.6707  European Traders Stuff Stocking With USD, Not EUR For Xmas by Jes Black  No Key Data; Federal Holiday  A steady flow of buy orders in thin holiday trade pushed USD higher following an initial sell off in Asian trade. USD/JPY rose above its opening level to a new high 3-year high of 129.87 in quiet European trade. JPY was also weak against the euro, but it held more than two yen above Friday's 2-year low at 116.65 per euro. Meanwhile, EUR/USD edged below Friday's close at 88.67 to a 2-week low of 87.78 as traders cut exposure to the single currency ahead of the Christmas holiday.  The euro's slide picked up speed in late European trade and plunged to a 2-week low of 87.78 cents, down almost one cent on the day. EUR/USD also fell further below 88.75, which marked the upper bound of the descending channel resistance of the move from its September high of 93.26. This is a bearish signal and indicates that like the pound, the European currencies' brief 2-week break of their downtrends vs the dollar may come to a close. EUR/USD also fell below 88.42 which marked the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 83.50 to 93.26. Next support is seen at 87.50.  Moreover, USD/CHF soared to a day's high of 1.6708 despite speculation that the Swiss franc could be a safe haven over the holidays. Rediscovered optimism in the dollar reversed the Swiss franc's rise to last week's high of 1.6280 as safe-haven flows were seen boosting CHF. Last week saw money flow out of emerging markets following the announcement Argentina's debt crisis, which fed fears of default. However, Argentina's debt default and the possibility of further terrorist attacks in the coming week failed to much of a positive effect on the franc which held steady against the euro around 1.4690. USD/CHF resistance is seen at1.6680. Support stands at 1.6550, 1.6585 and 1.6465.  No economic releases are scheduled for today or tomorrow, but the key economic news for the US this week includes November durable goods orders, Redbook retail average, Jobless claims and Consumer confidence. From the Eurozone, major economic due for release include French PPI, France's INSEE industry survey, Italy's labor force survey, Euro area balance of payments, Euro area M3, French unemployment rate. From Japan there is industrial production, retail sales, CPI, household consumption and unemployment data.  Last week's US data showed a series of better than expected data, which rekindled optimism that the US economy was showing signs of recovery. Supporting the dollar was the third consecutive rise in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey to 88.8 in the final December reading from the preliminary 85.8. The dollar had risen against the major currencies due to better-than-expected US jobless claims and Philadelphia Fed survey that sparked hope of a turnaround in the US economy. This contrasted with lower than expected data from the Eurozone and the Bank of Japan's seventh straight month of lowering their assessment of the economy. Recovering faith in the US was enough to render the downward revision of Q3 GDP to 1.3% a mute point and was also enough to offset a 0.7% fall in consumer spending and a 0.1% fall in personal income.  GBP/USD resisted further losses at the hand of a falling EUR/USD, but was dragged below Friday's 10-day low of 1.4344 to a fresh low of 1.4331. Sterling was able to resist dollar strength as it climbed to a fresh 5-week high of 61.30 pence against the euro. GBP/JPY also managed to maintain above the 186 level after a sharp sell-off on Friday brought it off of 2-year highs around 188.26. However, GBP/USD outlook is bearish as 1.46 proved tough resistance last week and the pair has since resumed its descending channel path after crossing below 1.4455. Friday's close below this level could be a confirmation of a false break higher. Resistance is seen at 1.4445, the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 1.4830 to 1.4060, followed by 1.4500/10.  Sterling is seen supported against the euro by Friday's remarks from Bank of England Governor George who said that there was a serious risk from a one size fits all monetary policy and that the persistent weakness of the euro was creating problems for the British economy. This highlighted the risk of the UK joining the euro given the ECB's reluctance to stimulate the economy despite the global downturn. EUR/GBP fell to a 5-week low of 61.30 pence, support seen at 61.00.  USD/JPY edged even closer to the key 130 mark and was undaunted by Japanese Trade Minister Hiranuma comments that a further drop in the yen was undesirable. Hiranuma's judgment is important because dealers will remained focused on any remarks coming out of Japan after last week's remarks showed little concern for a weaker yen. Dealers noted that the welcoming of a weaker yen could put JPY under further pressure in thin holiday trade this week. But Hiranuma's comments highlighted the fact that the focus from here will be how Japanese, US and Chinese officials react if USD/JPY passes 130 because of the trade implications of such a weak yen.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  USD Regains Footing vs European Majors and Yen  March 12, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8733 $/JPY..128.53 GBP/$..1.4163 $/CHF..1.6797  USD Regains Footing vs European Majors and Yen by Jes Black  At 8:55:00 AM US Weekly Redbook Sales (exp n/f, prev 0.7%) At 9:00:00 AM US BTM/UBSW Weekly Sales (exp n/f, prev -0.8%) At 10:00:00 AM US February Richmond Fed Survey Shipment (exp n/f, prev 4) US February Richmond Fed Service Revenues (exp n/f, prev  8) At 11:00:00 AM US Weekly ISI Company Index (exp n/f, prev 42.1)  The dollar staged a comeback on Tuesday, breaking key resistance levels against the euro and sterling, while climbing to a day's high of 128.95 yen in London trade. The stabilization against the yen makes calling the short-term direction difficult ahead of FY-end in March, but most dealers point out that current levels mark good entry points to go long USD/JPY over the medium term. Meanwhile, today's gains against the European majors put their recent rallies in question.  Data from the Eurozone today contrasted with last week's upbeat figures from the US. Euro area 2001 Q4 GDP showed an expected contraction of 0.2%, putting it up a mere 0.6% from a year earlier. The data had little impact on EUR/USD but did highlight the growth divergence after the surprising revision in US Q4 GDP from 0.2% to 1.4%.   EUR/USD broke below key support at 87.35, which marks the 50% retracement of the move from 86.29 to 88.39, and fell to a 1-week low of 87.20. More importantly, the pair now lies below 87.30, which is the trendline support of the bull move from 86.29. A break of 87.20 would call upon support at 87.10/00, and a break of that key support would damage the bullish sentiment and force many dealers to call 88.39 the high and look for possible new lows below 86.29. Resistance seen at 87.60, which marks the 61.8% retracement of the move from 86.29 to 88.39.  The larger than expected decline in UK industrial production data also helped the dollar gain ground today against the pound. Data from the UK was expected to show industrial production rose slightly in January by 0.1% after falling 10 of the previous 12 months. Instead, production contracted by 0.5% m/m to bring the annual rate down to -5.2% from -4.6%. Manufacturing data also contracted 0.4% m/m and 6.1% y/y in January. Today's data contrasts with the sharp break back above the key 50 level in the US ISM survey on manufacturing which gave dollar bulls a reason to sell GBP/USD.  GBP/USD broke below key support at 1.4180/85 and quickly fell to a new day's low of 1.4117 as it tripped stop loss orders along the way to a 1.5-week low before recovering to around 1.4150. Cable breached 1.4135 which marks trendline support from the 1.4043 low of this year. Support is seen at 1.4140 followed by 1.4110. Resistance at 1.4220, 1.4250, 1.4300 and the 200-day moving average of 1.4333.  USD/CHF bounced off support at 1.6780 which is the 50% retracement of the rise from the year's low of 1.6356 to the year's high of 1.7222. However, it could not regain its 200-day moving average of 1.6840 after it slipped below this level last week. Next support seen at 1.67, backed by 1.6680--the 61.8% retracement of the aforementioned move. Upside faces initial pressure at 1.6840 followed by 1.6885-the 38% retracement of the move. Next target seen at 1.6935-40.  Against the yen, the dollar climbed back from an overnight low of 127.75 to a session high of 128.95, but offers from Japanese exporters and speculators capped gains and held the pair below Monday's high of 129.15. USD/JPY rose to a day's high as profit-taking in the Nikkei's four-day rally of 5% last week pushed shares back 2% on Tuesday. There still remains doubt as to whether the Nikkei can maintain its recent gains after the March 31 fiscal year end and whether the spectacular rise in yen on speculative trading will come undone over the next few weeks. BoJ Governor Hayami alluded to this on Friday when he said he expected the market to be stable through the end of March, but did not say what could happen afterwards.  USD/JPY was also supported by further indications from Japanese officials that the yen's sharp rise last week was problematic for the Ministry of Finance which prefers a stable currency. Economics Minister Takenaka reiterated today that the yen's recent rise was too rapid and his comments were expected to keep speculators at bay. This followed Zembei Mizoguchi, head of the finance ministry's international bureau, who warned on Monday the authorities were prepared to take intervene in the markets if necessary.  This morning's announcement by the Japanese Government Pension Investment Fund had little effect on the yen despite it showing the fund would shift its weighting to 8% foreign bonds from 6% and reduce its holding of domestic stocks and bonds in response. Dealers say the 9 trillion yen in new money will likely be put in foreign assets too.  USD/JPY is now supported at 127.75, which marks the 38.2% retracement of the 115.75-135.15 move. On Monday, it provided a solid base for a corrective rally in the pair to a high of 129.15. However, speculators who had been on the sidelines have poured in to go long the yen. Therefore, USD/JPY could still target 125.28, the 50% retracement of the same move. More importantly, the yen is approaching its 200-day moving average of 125 for the first time since November. Resistance is seen at Monday's high of 129.15 followed by 129.65, 130.65 and 131.65 which mark the 38.25, 50%, and 61.8% retracements of the move from 134.95 to 126.32.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

November 19, 2001

TO:
All Members, Staff and Occupants of One North End Avenue

FROM:
Vincent Viola, Chairman
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:
On-Going Air Quality Testing


Air Quality Update
Air quality testing within One North End Avenue has been and will continue
to be the first priority of this Exchange.  As we previously indicated, the
Exchange has engaged Ambient Group, Inc., an extremely reputable independent
laboratory specializing in this area, to monitor the Exchange's air quality.
The Exchange has also taken a pro-active approach on testing for dangerous
chemicals outside the building.  Air quality tests were performed on
September 14th, 20th, 26th, October 4th, 9th, 12th, 18th, 23rd, 26th, 30th,
November 6th,  8th and, to date, all results have been well below the EPA,
OSHA, ASHREA, and ACGIH levels.

The air samples collected were tested for over 300 types and/or isomers of
chemicals including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for asbestos
structures, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, Acenaphtene, Acenaphthylene,
Anthracence, Benz (a) anthracene, Benz (a) pyrene, Benzo (b) fluorathene,
Benzo (ghi) perylene, Benzo (k) fluoranthene, Chrysene, Dibenz (a,h)
anthracene, Fluoranthene, Flourene, Indeno (1,2,3 cd) pyrene, Napthalene,
Phenanthrene, Pyrene, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead, Manganese,
Nickel, Silica and Zinc.

Ambient Group, Inc., has also secured a high-volume air sampling monitor
that tested for air borne chemicals outside the building including
chlorinated dioxins, PCBs, brominated dioxims and polycyclic hydrocarbons
(PAHs).  The results from these reports indicated that the levels of these
individual compounds are below their respective standards and guidelines.

All test results are posted and made available to all building occupants on
a weekly basis.

Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact Elliot
Zuckerman, Property Manager, at (212) 299-2242.

"(02-20) AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 9.05 (MARGINS)","
January 11,  2002
Notice No.  02-20
 
TO:                           NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING  MEMBERS
 
FROM:                    J. Robert Collins, Jr., President
 
SUBJECT:               AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 9.05 (MARGINS)
_________________________________________________________________________________          
 
Please  be advised that the Exchange has amended Rule 9.05, which governs Clearing  Members' use of money  market mutual funds to meet original margin requirements on the NYMEX  Division.  The amendments are shown  below and become effective today.   
 
Previously,  a Clearing Member's participation in any approved fund or any group of approved  funds offered by the same issuer was limited to the greater of $250,000 or 25%  of the Clearing Member's total original margin obligations.  
 
By  comparison, the new rule amendments delete this restriction, in effect allowing  a Clearing Member to meet 100% of its margin requirements with shares in one  money market fund.   
 
However,  the Clearing Member's participation in any such fund will be limited to 5% of  that money market fund.    
 
With regard to Rule 9.05, the Exchange continues to require that a money  market fund must be approved by the NYMEX Board and also must comply with CFTC  Regulation ? 1.25. 
 

AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX Rule  9.05 (Margins)
 
(asterisk indicates additions; bracketing indicates  deletion)

 
Rule 9.05             Margins
 
(E) Clearing Members may  meet original margin calls by depositing:
 
(4) Shares in a money  market mutual fund that complies with CFTC Regulation 1.25 and that has been  approved by the Board, subject to the following  conditions:
 
(i)                   for purposes of original margin,  such shares will be valued at 95% of market value:
 
(ii)                a Clearing Member's  participation in any approved fund [or any group of approved funds  offered by the same issuer] shall be limited to [ the greater  of $250,000 or 25% of the Clearing Member's total original margin  obligations ]    *   no more than 5% of that  fund;   *
 
(iii)              no more than 25% of the total assets of  an approved money market mutual fund may be used to meet original margin  obligations at the  Exchange.

"(01-353) Approved Amendments to COMEX Rule 4.94, ""Settlement Pric	e Procedures for Copper Contracts""","Notice to Members No: 01-353
October 23, 2001

TO:		ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
		ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBER FIRMS
		ALL COMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM: 	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	Approved Amendments to COMEX Rule 4.94, ""Settlement Price
Procedures for Copper Contracts""


The Exchange has complied with regulatory requirements by filing with the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission amendments to COMEX Rule 4.94,
""Settlement Price Procedures for Copper Contracts"".  The approved amendments
to Rule 4.94 modify the settlement price procedure for the current delivery
month by taking into consideration, not only the weighted average price
(rounded to the nearest minimum fluctuation) of all outright transaction
that occur in the closing range, but also the weighted average for all
spreads executed and all spread bids and offers actively represented between
the most active month and the current delivery month during the final thirty
minutes of trading.

A copy of the amended Rule 4.94 is attached.  These Rule amendments will
become effective on Monday, October 29, 2001.

Should you have any questions please contact Michael Campanelli at
212-299-2072, Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608 or Ploumi Efkarpidis at
212-299-2334.

Approved Rule Amendments
(Asterisk indicates additions: bracketing indicates deletions)

Rule 4.94	Settlement Price Procedures for Copper Contracts.

	(A)(i) The term ""base month"" shall mean the March, May, July,
September, and December delivery months; (ii) the term ""most active month""
with respect to this rule and the rules of COMEX Chapters 11 and 17 shall
mean the base month that is not the current delivery month, with the
greatest reported open interest on the official COMEX daily open interest
report.

* (B)   The settlement price for the current delivery month shall be
comprised of the weighted average price (rounded to the nearest minimum
fluctuation) of all outright transactions that occur in the closing range
combined with the weighted average price of all spreads executed between the
current delivery month and the most active month and all spread bids and
offers between the current delivery month and the most active month actively
represented during the final 30 minutes of trading.  If no outright
transactions occur in the closing range or no spreads are executed or there
are no spread bids and offers actively represented during the final 30
minutes of trading in the current delivery month, the settlement price shall
be the last trade price, unless during the closing range a bid higher or
offer lower than the last trade price is made.  In such event, such higher
bid or lower offer shall be the settlement price. *

	[(B)] *(C) *  The settlement price for the [current delivery month
and the] most active month shall be the weighted average price (rounded to
the nearest minimum fluctuation) of all outright transactions that occur in
the closing range.  If no outright transactions occur in the closing range
of [either the current delivery month and] the most active month, the
settlement price [for the applicable month] shall be the last trade price,
unless during the closing range a bid higher or offer lower than the last
trade price is made.  In such event, such higher bid or lower offer shall be
the settlement price.

	[(C)] *(D)*  In all other delivery months, the settlement prices
shall be determined based upon spread relationships between and among
contract months, which relationships shall be determined in the judgment of
the Settlement Price Committee with:  (a) greater weight given to spreads
executed late in the trading day in large volumes, and (b) lesser weight
given to (i) spreads traded in lesser volumes, (ii) spread bids and offers
actively represented late in the trading day, and (iii) spread transactions,
bids and offers from earlier in the trading day.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no settlement price shall be established that would be lower than
the best outright bid, or higher than the best outright offer, that:  (a)
was for at least 20 contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and
had remained available for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes
of trading of that trading day.

	[(D)] *(E)*  If any settlement price, determined pursuant to
Paragraph [(C)] *(D)*, is inconsistent with transactions that occurred
during the closing range for other delivery months of the same futures
contract or with other market information known to the Committee, the
Committee may establish a settlement price at a level consistent with such
other transactions or market information.  In such event, the Committee
shall prepare a written record of the basis for any settlement price so
established.

"America Fights Back - The Latest","To Our Readers:

ABCNEWS.com has the latest on what's making headlines in the United States
and around the world:

The new government of Afghanistan will commit as many as 15,000 troops to
aid the United States in its search for Osama bin Laden and members of al
Qaeda, the deputy defense minister said today.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/STRIKE_MAIN.html

The fuses for the explosives authorities say were in the shoes worn by
Richard Reid on a trans-Atlantic flight may have been too moist to light,
preventing the man from carrying out a suspected plot to blow up the
plane.  Reid is due in federal court in Boston today for a detention
hearing, where federal prosecutors are expected to ask that he be held
without bail.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/airplane_explosives011228.html

ABCNEWS.com wishes you and your family a happy and healthy new year.  The
year 2001 will forever be remembered for one day: Sept. 11. In a moment,
the world shook and life as Americans had known it changed forever.
ABCNEWS.com takes a look back at that defining day and the other headlines

Stay with ABCNEWS.com for the latest on the war on terrorism, the attacks
on Taliban and al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan and the anthrax
discoveries. Here's what making news right now:

In his first overseas trip since the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush is
shoring up support for the international fight against terrorism from key
Asian leaders at a summit in China.
http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/STRIKE_MAIN.html

A CBS News employee in Dan Rather's office has tested positive for the
skin form of anthrax. This news comes as U.S. Capitol office buildings are
swept for anthrax bacteria after dozens of Capitol Hill employees tested
positive for exposure to the potentially deadly bacteria.

Fed Survey (exp 12.9, prev  14.7)  The dollar edged higher against the European majors and surged higher against the yen this morning. However, dealers expressed nervousness about going long the dollar after two tumultuous days on Wall Street that whipsawed the greenback back and forth. Wednesday's recovery in US equities helped the dollar regain investor confidence.   But key data from the US today could undermine any further dollar gains.   EUR/USD fell to a 2-day low of to 86.84, but failed to target support at 86.60/50. Dealers warn that action is becoming increasingly volatile and directionless, but gains and losses are seen tracking Wall Street carefully. Therefore, most dealers see the recent EUR/USD rebound as a further correction from its bear trend since September. This reflects the view that US equity losses are also a temporary phenomenon. But despite  Enronitis  gripping the market for over a month now, it remains the main story on the Street.   Therefore, EUR/USD could stage another recovery given Japan's economic woes and Wall Street's accounting concerns. While some traders expect a pullback towards 86.50, others see the possibility of a run towards 87.50 88.00, 88.60 and even 88.80. But if the pair was to fail breaking the last resistance zone, it could resume its downtrend from there.   In London trade the dollar rose to a day's high of 134.04 yen today while EUR/USD languished around a low of 116.07 until rebounding to a day's high of 116.74 and carrying EUR/USD back above 87-cents. So, also watch the EUR/JPY cross for its divergence from USD/JPY (since USD/JPY gains are seen capped at 135) where a move higher could boost EUR/USD.  Weighing on the euro today was a surprise 0.4% fall in French consumer spending in January which sent the yearly rate to 1.2% from 3.8% and pushed the euro to a day's low of 86.84. Meanwhile, mixed data from Italy had little effect on the market. Italy's December industrial sales rose 0.3% m/m, but fell an unadjusted 6.8% y/y in 2001. Industrial orders also fell 3.5% y/y. Italian cities reported preliminary consumer price inflation data for February up 2.5% y/y from 2.4%.  Data from the UK also dragged GBP/USD below yesterday's low of 1.4261 after back to back surprise declines in UK retail sales worried dealers. Retail sales fell for the second month in January, down 0.3% m/m to bring the yearly rate down to 4.2%. GBP/USD fell  to a day's low of 1.4237, just above key support at 1.4235. Dealers realized this was the first time retail sales had fallen two consecutive months since 1998. The drop left some wondering if sales which peaked at 7% annually in November are now going to level off as the Bank of England had hoped. This would put off future interest rate hikes and weigh on the pound. Support stands at 1.4225, 1.420 and 1.4150. Upside capped at 1.4340, 1.4365 and 1.440.  EUR/GBP also rose on sterling weakness to a day's high of 61.17. But, the EMU debate had little effect on sterling today as the market comes to grips with PM Blair's commitment to a referendum and the Chancellor Brown's skepticism.   Meanwhile, USD/JPY surged to a 10-day high of 134.25 after a large buy order drove the yen lower across the board. Earlier, USD/JPY had a brief rally to 134.04 after Former Japanese Finance Minister Sakakibara, aka Mr. Yen reiterated today his belief that the dollar could reach 150-160 yen towards year end. Sakakibara says Japan is in a state of economic crisis and this could spread to the financial sector soon. USD/JPY then eased back towards support at 133.40/50. Resistance is seen at 133.70, 134.00 and 135.00. Support is seen at 133.40, 133.00, 132.65 and 132.35.  Sakakibara's view is widely held by the markets and reflects a growing unease with Japan's lax position towards reform and their inability to come up with a coherent plan that tackles deflation and the financial sector. Markets grew weary with Japanese rhetoric on Tuesday after listening intently last week to a number of assurances to shore up the financial system and tackle deflation. The market was also disappointed by Japan's shying away on the injection of public funds into the troubled banking sector. Even though the yen fell, the Nikkei jumped 4.7% today on hopes that corporations would continue to write off bad debt and that the government would combat deflation.  Dealers are likely to remain on the sideline ahead of important economic news from the US later in the day and will keep eyes glued to Wall Street's performance. Weekly jobless claims due at 8:30 AM are expected to be unchanged from the previous week at 373,000, while January lead indicators, due at 10:00 AM, are forecast to rise 0.5% from 1.2% last month. Markets will also focus on today's US international trade balance, which is expected to widen to -28.3 billion in December from the previous deficit of 27.8 billion as sluggish global demand takes its toll on US exports.  But today's key data is the Philadelphia Fed survey of manufacturing activity for February, which is expected to decline to 13.0 from the previous 14.7. Yet, improvements in the NAPM component could be a boost.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Can we have a short meeting to identify our immediate path for trade termination?  I'm not certain of the critical steps required before we can begin to respond.  

I have a short list of questions.

I apologize if you covered this in yesterday's meeting.  Thanks.

US non-farm payrolls rose for the first time since July 2001 and by its largest amount in a year to 66k in February from the previous revised 126k, marking a positive development in the heretofore struggling labor market. Moreover, in contrast with forecasts, the US unemployment rate also declined for the second straight month to its lowest since October 2001 to 5.5% in February from the previous 5.6%.  The Japanese currency had been held back by jawboning comments in the previous Asian session, as Japanese officials expressed their displeasure with the yen's week-long rally and its largest surge against the greenback in two years. Japan's Economics Minister Takenaka and the MoF's Kuroda warned that the Finance Ministry could take action against rapid currency fluctuations.   Nonetheless, the yen is likely to find strength on repatriation ahead of the fiscal year-end on March 31, despite dismal economic conditions. The latest GDP data showed that growth fell 1.2% q/q in Q4 for the third straight quarter, and once the artificial support is eliminated, analysts believe a fall in the yen is inevitable. However, Japanese assets may see further inflows as institutions have begun looking more favorably to non-US assets in light of glimmers of a US-led global recovery.  LDP Secretary General Taku Yamasaki remarked that he would strive to ensure that the economy would bottom by next fall at the very latest. And indeed there is much reason to hope for a brighter Japanese economic outlook. The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that the Cabinet Office is purportedly planning to leave out the term  worsening  for the first time in 10 months in its March economic assessment report, in what would be the first upward revision in its economic outlook since June 2000. According to insiders, Economics Minister Takenaka is expected to comment that although  the economy is still struggling, there appears to be improvements in certain areas . Consumer spending and capital investments continue to show signs of weakness, whereas the decline in exports looks to have eased as the US economy exhibits signs of a recovery. In addition, another area of improvement in Japan's beleaguered economy is seen in the inventory adjustments in electrical machinery and other goods.    This week's US economic highlights include wholesale trade, retail sales, jobless claims, business inventories, import/export prices, current account balance, PPI, industrial production, and the University of Michigan consumer confidence survey. Key Eurozone indicators consist of GDP, German foreign trade, French CPI, Spanish retail sales, Spanish CPI, ECB monthly bulletin, French employment, French industrial production, Italian industrial production, French trade balance, and Italian CPI.

"FW: Oil Prepay Rollover","Dan:  Neither credit nor legal has ever received info about the ""Cayman branch"" (if it is a branch) so we have never assessed that entity in full.  Treasa and Raj were trying to avoid use of that entity and trying to stick with CSFBI.  Sara

Subject:	RE: Oil Prepay Rollover

As I do not have any details of this deal, I cannot comment on the need for a carve out of margining rights. The only issue that I have been aware of is the Cayman branch possibility.  My comment on that to bothe Raj and Teresa was that if it is in fact a different legal entity (as determined by legal) then I will need financial information to make an assessment of this entity.  If it is a branch and part of CSFB International, which is sometimes the case with financial institutions, we would have recourse to CSFB International and it would be confirmed under the existing document. 

Regards,
Tanya

Raj:  CAVEAT:  I never heard back from Tanya about whether the CSFB confirmation would have a carve-out for margining pursuant to the master agreement.  Bob was going to send me the format he drafted for  the prior CSFB deal but which was never executed so that I could incorporate that language.  Tanya may agree to allow this trade to margin under the agreement just like the confirm which terminated 9/12/01.

Sara/ Bob, 

Further to my discussions with Sara yesterday evening, and in the absence of any email from both of you to the contrary, I conclude that the confirms as they stand now should be OK from a legal perspective, subject to the credit approval of the entities. As I mentioned yesterday, Treasa's contact at CSFB here is trying to retain CSFB International as the counter-party as was the case for the 2000 transaction earlier. 

Thanks very much for your help. 

Regards

Rajaram Jamadagni

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]   Japanese Forex Trading Preview  February 13, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8712 $/JPY..132.98 GBP/$..1.4285 $/CHF..1.700   Japanese Forex Trading Preview by Darko Pavlovic  At Japan Dec Current Account (exp 730 bln, prev 1125 bln)  At 11:30:00 PM Japan Dec Ind prod. m/m (exp 2.1%, prev -1.7%)   The dollar slightly eased vs. the yen, trading around 133.00, off from its highs in New York trading of 133.45, boosted by strong US retail sales and more warnings to Japan from rating agencies. US retail sales (core) posted its largest increase since March 2000 and excluding autos soared 1.2% in January from the previous revised 0.7%, higher than expected rise of 0.4%. Accounting for the majority of the gain in core retail sales was a 5.1% surge in gasoline sales in January from the previous revised -3.2%, marking its steepest rise since February 2000. The yen was hurt after Moody rating agency announced it might lower Japan's government domestic rating by up to two notches from the current Aa3. Yesterday, Standard & Poor's said that it was considering changing its rating on Japan's debt unless Japan showed clear progress in structural reform and economic recovery. Japan Dec unadjusted current account surplus rose 42% from a year earlier to 971.8 bln yen. The current account surplus for 2001 fell 12% from the previous year at 11.06 trln yen, while trade surplus for the year plunged 32% to 8.52 trln yen. Currency markets will be listening for any comments that may emerge from President Bush's trip to Japan on February 17. Rumors are circulating that Japanese authorities may announce at that time a bail out package for Japan's banks, especially in light of the recent warnings by Moody's and S?of further downgrades. In its February economic report the government said that ""the Japanese economy continues to deteriorate"", keeping its general economic assessment unchanged for the third straight month. The assessment was unchanged in the areas of private consumption and capital spending while estimation for industrial production was upgraded. PM Koizumi asked his economic ministers to draw up a comprehensive package of measures to fight deflation. . The BoJ Governor Hayami said that Japan's financial system remains stable and central bank will take action if necessary, but there is no need to increase government bond purchases now. Resistance is eyed at 134.0, 134.60 and 135.0. Support is seen at 133.0, 132.50 and 132.20.   EUR/USD fell to one-third cent to a 2-session low of 87.08, due to unexpected rise in US retail sales and market expectations that the US economy is getting out of recession faster than the European one. ECB Vice President Christian Noyer said that the single currency is extremely undervalued vs. the dollar and could strengthen without damaging European economies, but his remarks had no impact on the euro. Upside capped at 88.0, 88.50 and 89.0. Support holds at 87.0, 86.65 and 86.40.  Tomorrow's release of US business inventories is likely to show a slight improvement to -0.5% in December from the previous month's -1.0%, helped by a rise in retail inventories to -0.2% from the previous -1.0%. The change in inventories is seen to bring down Q4 GDP from its preliminary reading of 0.2% q/q. Meanwhile, import prices are expected to rise to -0.1% in January from -0.9% in December, due to increasing oil prices.  This week's other major US economic releases include jobless claims, PPI, industrial production and the University of Michigan confidence survey. Key Eurozone indicators consist of the ECB monthly bulletin, German retail sales, Dutch GDP, German CPI and HICP, French employment, French trade balance, French industrial production and Italian industrial production. Highlights from Japan comprise the balance of payments, industrial production and Tokyo department store sales.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

(exp -0.5%, prev -1.4%) At 2:00:00 PM US Fed Beige Book (exp n/f, prev n/a)  The dollar added to gains in European trade as the euro fell to fresh lows against the dollar, yen and pound. Weighing on the single currency was sharp losses in the euro/yen to a fresh 3-week low of 115.67 since hitting a 2-year high of 119.71 on January 2. This spilled over into EUR/USD losses as key stops were triggered on its way to a fresh 3-week low of 88.04. The single currency was also down against the Swiss franc after dropping sharply in after-hours US trade on Tuesday, giving way to speculation the euro fell victim to Spanish banking losses in Argentina.  Despite dollar gains and euro losses, markets will remained focused on today's data and earnings announcement for further direction. Tuesday marked the start of earnings season and even though most companies beat poor Q4 expectations, the markets responded more to the general outlook and pushed shares up only slightly. Therefore, data will dictate as well this week. Economists forecast more improvements, and therefore, the dollar is likely to find support as long as the data meets or exceeds expectations.  Today's data includes business inventories, industrial production figures, the Beige book and CPI. Business inventories are expected to continue to decline in November, adding to the inventory correction which will be positive for the economy and the market. Industrial production is expected to be flat in December after the improvement in manufacturing PMI. This comes after four consecutive declines. The CPI report for December is expected to show that inflation trends are still tame, with a rise of 0.1% m/m. Markets will also look to the Fed's Beige book for their assessment of the current climate.  The key earnings announcements for today include General Motors at 8:00 AM, followed by Continental Airlines. It will also be a big day for tech stocks with Yahoo!, Advanced Micro Devices, Apple Computer, Compaq Computer, and Macromedia all reporting after the bell.  EUR/USD fell to a fresh 20-day low of 88.04 after falling below the key 89.10 level, which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. This level is significant in that it reflects equilibrium in supply and demand conditions between euro and dollar, indicating investors are unsure as to the future direction the pair will take. Moves higher are not seen by the market as indicating strength given the euro's difficulty to remain above 90-cents.   Moreover, yesterday's close below 88.60 is a bearish sign for the euro and an inability to regain that level will likely call upon further losses. But moves in the JPY will be important to watch as most of EUR/USD losses come on the back of a steep fall in EUR/JPY to a low of 115.67 from a high of 119.37 last week, or a 3% drop. That's double the losses incurred by USD/JPY. In the meantime, EUR/USD would have to break back above 89.50 for any hope of a near term recovery.  GBP/USD fell to a fresh one-week low of 1.4357, down from Monday's 2-week high of 1.4513 as losses vs JPY and losses in EUR/USD weighed on sterling as well. However, GBP was supported by weekend comments from PM Blair concerning EMU entry. Blair's comments have allowed GBP to keep EUR under pressure around 61.23 pence after falling as far as 62.80 at the start of the year. However, failure for GBP to maintain above 1.4440 will bode poorly for cable. Support is seen at 1.4360 and 1.4340 and 1.4320. Resistance is seen at 1.4390, 1.4440, 1.4480, 1.450 and 1.4550.  Meanwhile, JPY was little changed after the Bank of Japan Policy Board kept monetary policy unchanged with a current account deposit target at 10-15 trln yen. However, the central bank also decided to expand the range of eligible collateral for its money market operations as a new way of supplying funds to the money market. The BoJ was not expected to do something unorthodox which would give the impression that they were deliberately weakening the yen. Therefore, the buying foreign assets may not be an option if the market continues to push JPY lower.  USD/JPY rose to a day's high of 131.65, up from overnight lows around 130.80 after that support level held. Corrective yen buying was anticipated given the highly oversold position of the yen in recent weeks as it fell 10 points in 6 weeks to a 3-year low of 133.37 against the dollar. Any correction in USD/JPY will have to hold above 130.40 to maintain its bullish trend, dealers say.  EUR/JPY was not as lucky, only rising to a day's high of 116.24 before paring gains to a new 3-week low of 115.67. EUR/JPY losses were more pronounced as it broke out of its steep 2-month up trend from around 106 to a 2-year high of 119.71 on January 2. Since the euro's climb was steeper than that of the dollar against the yen, it was more vulnerable to a deeper retracement than USD/JPY. That was the case after EUR/JPY broke below support at 116.50. Resistance is now seen at 116.50 followed by 117.00 and key resistance at 117.50. A close above 116.50 will be needed in order to maintain its bullish momentum, dealers say. Key support is seen at 115.60.  Helping JPY was a declaration from Finance Minister Shiokawa that Japan was not intentionally guiding the yen lower and that that regional concerns about the weaker yen were a misunderstanding. But the impact was muted, as Japan's government maintained its bleak view on the economy the December monthly report, citing record-high unemployment and increasingly frequent bankruptcies. JPY was also weighed by Japan's Econ Min Takenaka who said the movements in FX markets have not been extreme.  In other news, Argentina's central bank intervened in the floating peso market overnight to prop up the currency when it weakened to near 2.0 pesos/dollar.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  USD and JPY Rangebound Ahead of Greenspan and Japan  February 25, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8735 $/JPY..133.89 GBP/$..1.4290 $/CHF..1.6918  USD and JPY Rangebound Ahead of Greenspan and Japan by Jes Black  At 10:00:00 AM US Jan Existing Homes (exp 5.2 mln, prev 5.19 mln)  The dollar recouped about half of Friday's losses against the euro and sterling but remained mired in recent ranges ahead of this week's key policy meetings and economic data. Fed chairman Greenspan is set to speak on Wednesday and upbeat US data are expected to allow the chairman to take an optimistic tone. But accounting concerns have so far constrained the dollar despite signs of a nascent recovery.   EUR/USD fell to a day's low of 87.33 but maintained above support at 87.35/40. A break of 87.40 targets 87.00/10 followed by 86.50. But the dollar could come under further pressure if investors were seen to be avoiding the US market. Therefore, a key factor for EUR/USD this week is corporate sentiment and the direction of US equities. Dealers will closely scrutinize capital flow data to the US and Eurozone. Worries could send the dollar lower across the board and possibly toward 88.80 against the euro in the near term, despite positive economic data from the US. Resistance is seen at 88.00, 88.60 and even 88.80. But if the pair was to fail breaking the last resistance zone, it could resume its downtrend from there. This reflects the view that US equity losses are also a temporary phenomenon and that a rise in the euro is not a reflection of its own strength.   Tuesday's German Ifo business survey will also be key to the euro's near term direction as markets expect a rise to 87.3 in February from 86.3. Business confidence probably improved again but has yet to reach the pre-September 11 level of 89.3. However, expectations have greatly improved, as evidenced by last week's surge in the German ZEW sentiment survey to 50.2 from 35.9 in January, which foretells a significant improvement over the next 6 months.  GBP/USD fell to a day's low of 1.4284 as it came under increasing pressure against both the euro and dollar. GBP/USD fell half a cent to a day's low of 1.4287, while sterling also fell to a low of 61.25 pence agaisnt the euro. GBP/USD support seen at at 1.4285, 1.4235, 1.4200 and 1.4150. Upside capped at 1.4340, 1.4365 and 1.440. Sterling remains weak after back-to-back surprise declines in UK retail sales were seen as a sign that the UK's two-speed economy may be converging finally. With consumer spending falling and manufacturing slowly rising, it stands in sharp contrast with the upbeat outlook for the US. GBP also likely to remain under pressure after PM Blair has stepped up the EMU propaganda machine, which can weigh on the pound because markets anticipate the pound to join at a lower value. Moreover, fears of pension reform that could divert asset away from UK investments, and a possible tax hike to pay for health care reform are two other factors weighing on sterling.  Meanwhile, the yen rose on short covering today ahead of this week's two key events in Japan. First, the Japanese government is expected to finally release its anti-deflation package on Wednesday, along with proposals for dealing with non-performing loan disposal. Dealers will look for any new easing measures taken by the Japanese to tackle deflation. But Should Japanese officials think that the coming global recovery will allow them to muddle through and not enact tough love reforms, then the market is likely to be disappointed and sell the yen.  Then, the Bank of Japan meets on Thursday to set monetary policy, and dealers think the central bank may increase its purchases of Japanese government bonds to 1 trillion from 800 million. However, this is not expected to satisfy the FX market, which has come to view liquidity as more or less a mute point amid rampant deflation and lack of demand. Therefore, the yen is in a lose-lose situation because if the BoJ takes no action the yen is likely to weaken on disappointment. Or, if the BoJ does inject more liquidity, the yen could, as in the past, weaken in reaction. Upside capped at 134.50, followed by 134.85 and strong resistance at 135.15. Support holds at 133.20, 133.0 and 132.50.  Meanwhile, the dollar will continue to trade hesitantly amid Wall Street whims and Greenspan's key semi-annual testimony to the Congress on Wednesday. Markets will look for any hints that the chairman is becoming more bullish on the prospects for the US recovery and whether the Fed may begin to raise interest rates sometime this year.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  JPY Soars To Spectacular Heights On Speculative Flows  March 7, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8763 $/JPY..128.82 GBP/$..1.4203 $/CHF..1.6803  JPY Soars To Spectacular Heights On Speculative Flows by Jes Black  At 7:00 AM BoE MPC meeting (exp 4.0%, prev 4.0%) At 7:45 AM ECB meeting (exp 3.25%, prev 3.25%) At 8:30:00 AM US Q4 Unit Labor Costs rev (exp -1.4%, prev -1.1%) US Q4 Productivity Rev (exp 3.9%, prev 3.5%) US Jobless Claims (exp 370k, prev 378k) At 3:00:00 PM US Jan Consumer Credit  (exp -3.1 bln, prev -5.1 bln) At 10:00 AM Fed Chairman Greenspan speech before Senate Banking Committee.   The dollar recovered from sharp losses against the European majors in London trade but extended its slide against the yen on Thursday as speculators who had been on the sidelines poured in to go long the yen. Japan's Nikkei also continued its climb and the government's resolve to boost Japanese assets ahead of March 31 is likely to fend off any negative news that comes its way. JPY added to its weeklong gains exploding through key options positions to hit 10-week highs of 128.68 and 112.87 against the dollar and euro.  JPY has recovered sharply from its last test of 135 resistance vs USD, rising over 4% in the past 7 trading days and the dollar is now threatening chart support at 127.75, which marks the 38.2% retracement of the 115.75-135.15 move. This should provide a solid base for a corrective rally in USD/JPY but supporting the yen were signs that US fund managers would increase their exposure to Japan just as government officials have created an artificial floor under share prices through stricter short selling laws. Combined with repatriation fears ahead of March 31 further yen gains cannot be ruled out. Support seen at 128.60, 128.00 and 127.75. Resistance is eyed at 130.50, 130.90, and 131.50.  There was little buzz ahead of today's two monetary policy meetings from the Eurozone and UK as both are expected to keep rates unchanged at 3.25% and 4.0% amid signs that the economic malaise is over.   Today's better-than-expected 0.1% rise in Swiss GDP avoided expectations of recession and points to signs the Swiss economy may also be past the worst, making it less likely the central bank will pare interest rates for a fifth time in a year when policy makers meet on March 21. The Swiss Purchasing Managers' index on industrial activity in February rose last week to an eight-month high, and the KOF institute's leading economic indicators gained for the first time in almost two years in January. USD/CHF maintained around 1.68 after a brief fall to 1.6735.  With increased confidence, German Fin Min Eichel said today that economic growth in the euro zone could reach a rate of 3% by the end of 2002. Eichel's comments come ahead of today's ECB meeting at 7:45 AM, where the market expects no rate change due to improving conditions. A jump in Germany's Ifo business climate index to a six-month high, improved purchasing managers' surveys and other indicators all back the ECB's view that the economy should regain momentum later in the year.  Sterling is also trading steady ahead of today's Bank of England monetary policy committee meeting. The majority of economists believe that the BoE will keep rates steady at 4.0%, particularly after the central bank governor Eddie George made comments with the intent of dampening market hopes for interest rate hikes later in the year.  Sharp USD/JPY losses on Thursday added fuel to the euro's fire as it climbed to new highs of 61.70 pence and 88.13 cents. But a subsequent plunge in EUR/JPY to a new 3-month low of 112.65 wiped out most of the euro's sharp gains against the dollar and sent it back to support around a day's low of 87.55. Maintaining above this level will be key for the euro in order to take out 88.10 cents which is the 50% retracement of this year's move 90.63 to 85.63. From there, the euro faces its next resistance at 88.50. Support is viewed at 87.0, backed by 86.65 and 86.30.  GBP/USD broke through tough resistance at 1.4245 and hit a new high of 1.4313 despite added gains in EUR/GBP from trendline support at 61.15 to a new high of 61.70 which has kept sterling under pressure. But sterling gave back most of those gains and fell to a day's low of 1.4220. Therefore, resistance is still eyed at 1.4240/50, 1.4280 and 1.430. Support holds at 1.4180 and 1.4130.  Despite a falling dollar, stock markets powered higher this week amid increasing confidence in an economic recovery after being held back by Enronitis for the last couple months. But growing confidence in a simultaneous global recovery has sent some investors overseas in search of higher returns given the high prices of US equities. This has put European and Japanese assets in demand and is sapping strength from the capital inflow dependant dollar.   Today's data is expected to confirm upbeat projections and key US productivity data should be revised higher in line with the recent upward revision in GDP Q4. Likewise, chain store sales growth is expected to be strong again in February, indicating continued consumer resilience.  Fed Chairman Greenspan is also due to testify before the US Senate Banking committee at 10:00 AM. Today's speech by Greenspan on monetary policy is not likely to deviate from last week's guarded optimism, but given the recent spate of data, Greenspan may sound more upbeat.  Friday's key US labor market report will also keep dollar bulls anxiously awaiting further signs of recovery which may pull the greenback out of rangebound trading. But the dollar's recent failure to benefit from strong data and Wall Street's gains has left dollar bulls feeling uncertain.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

(exp n/a, prev -1%)  Sterling rose to day highs across the board ahead of the Bank of England's rate decision at 7:00 AM, which left rates unchanged at 4.0% as expected. Investors considered the BoE's decision evidence that strong consumer spending was driving growth in the UK. GBP/USD rose more than one cent to a high of 1.4462 from an overnight low of 1.4340, but remained within a channel from 1.4340 to 1.4480. Against the euro, sterling rose to a high of 61.73 pence, but resistance at 61.70 held, which should keep sterling's gains in check. However, follow-up buying in GBP was subdued as markets generally expected no rate cut from the BoE.  The euro also rose to a day's high around 89.35 cents ahead of key Eurozone data today, but fell following a surprise drop in German data. November industrial output fell 1.8% m/m after strong declines in the previous months to bring the y/y down 4.8%. The decline beat the consensus forecast for a fall of 0.2% and was very negative, but possibly not surprising given the amount of attention paid to Germany's manufacturing woes. Nevertheless, the fall is likely to put Q4 GDP at or near 0% and will put the ECB in a bind to cut interest rates in February.   EUR/USD price action continued to move within a channel from 88.70 to 89.50 as it hovers around the key 89.10 level, which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. Overnight, the pair briefly tested resistance at 89.50, but was rejected. Now, failure to maintain above 89.10/20 would probably call for a test lower to 88.70 followed by 87.60, which marks the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the same move. Moves higher are not seen by the market as indicating strength given the euro's difficulty to remain above 90-cents.  Meanwhile, the yen pared earlier gains despite concerns voiced by Japanese officials today that the yen's slide was too fast. Dealers were quick to buy USD/JPY near the 132.00 level after its recent fall from a new 3-year high of 133.37. PM Koizumi said at visit to Malaysia that Japan was not lowering the yen intentionally and that FX rates should be decided by markets.  However, Malaysian PM Mahathir said he was watching with interest the impact of a yen fall on the Chinese yuan and ASEAN currencies.   Concern over the yen's 10% decline over the past 2 months corresponds with PM Koizumi's 7-day tour around Southeast Asia, which began on Wednesday. Although US monetary officials have expressed a desire to let markets determine FX rates, countries such as China and Korea have voiced concern about Japan exporting their deflation to the rest of the area. Overnight remarks by an official from South Korea's Finance and Economic Ministry that the weakening in the yen could create malaise in other Asian markets, hints that for political reasons Japanese officials are now likely to remain quiet until the PM returns.  Therefore, in the absence of further encouragement by Japanese monetary officials for a weaker yen, a period of consolidation would not be unusual. But any correction in USD/JPY would likely hold around 130-132 dealers say. EUR/JPY rose to a day's high of 118.76 but needs to hold above yesterday's low of 117.50 or it may target last week's lows around 116.90 and the 2-week low of 116.50. Upside is seen capped at 118.75 and last week's 2-year high of 119.71.  Despite the yen's reprieve from further losses, market sentiment remains very bearish. A recent report from the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research says that JPY will come under further pressure in March once the market realizes that Japan is on the road to default if it does not reflate the economy. The Economic Outlook report contends that the government is expected to incur an unsustainable debt burden of $1 trillion in protecting depositors from the collapsing banking system in March when deposit insurance is revoked and Japanese investors likely make a run on the bank, thereby bringing collapse.  Ex-Japanese Minister of Finance Sakakibara, aka Mr. Yen, also said he sees the yen possibly falling to 150-160 per dollar towards year end. However, Sakakibara warned of possible intervention if the dollar rises above the psychological level of 140 yen. Mr. Yen said that yen weakness would permeate through to other Asian currencies which should gradually weaken vs dollar along with yen. In reference to Bank of Japan policy, he said the bank should keep easy monetary policy including more JGB purchases, but warned that excessive government spending would be ineffective and could lead to a collapse in the JGB market.  USD/CHF surged to 1.6619 after testing a session low of 1.6527 in early European trade. Trendline support at 1.6500 followed by 1.6410 should hold for further test higher, as rumors that the SNB may have been intervening to weaken the franc helped the currency slide to a low of 1.4833 vs the euro as well. The SNB is trying to talk the franc lower as a cheaper franc would boost export prospects and ease the economic pains facing the country. However, the SNB is unlikely to dramatically lower interest rates to do so. Swiss National Bank Vice-Chairman Gehrig reportedly said in an interview on Wednesday that the SNB's next move could be either up or down. This surprise comment caught markets off guard and given that the economy should show flat growth in H2 2002, as well as the central bank's dissatisfaction with the current strong CHF exchange rate.  Meanwhile, markets will be looking for signs of economic recovery in the US and more gains on Wall Street after yesterday's sour finish. The dollar strengthened across-the-board yesterday, encouraged by the rally in the US stock market for most of the day stemming from positive comments from technology bellwethers Cisco and Oracle. Even though the gains in equities dissipated by the close of trading, the greenback managed to hold onto its gains against the majors. But, dealers will watch to see if U.S. markets are getting ahead of themselves in anticipating a U.S. recovery.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

[IMAGE] Forums Discuss these points in the Forums:  Forexnews Forum       Technicals Live Charts Analysis available from: Cornelius Luca   J.P. Chorek   Technical Research Ltd.   Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  February 5, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8677 $/JPY..133.79 GBP/$..14150 $/CHF..1.6973  Japanese Forex Trading Preview  by Darko Pavlovic  No key data.   The yen had its biggest fall in four months vs. the dollar of 134.29 after Nikkei fell to 18 years low and S?downgraded the ratings for seven large Japanese banks. Another rating agency Moody's was reviewing seven major life insurance companies for possible downgrades. The Japanese currency remained beset by pessimism after opinion polls showed that support for Prime Minister Koizumi was waning, and thus may hinder the implementation of critical structural reforms. The yen fell 1.5% to 134.29 from 132.35 yen a 1 1/3 slide. The most current poll showed that only 49% of the public supports Koizumi, down from 72% last month. As the U.S. President Bush's visit to Japan approaches in mid-month it is likely that Bush would give additional support for the structural reform initiative led by PM Koizumi. But some analysts believe there is a shift in a US stance from bad loans cleanup to economic growth. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill who visited Japan last month said to his counterpart Shiokawa that the U.S. wants to see Japan return to a growth. The FSA submitted to the ruling LDP a report stating that the banks' disposals of bad loans should be completed within two to three years, as planned. The government plans to clear about 12 trillion yen worth of loans out of the 20 trillion yen in bad debts held by large banks by the end of September 2002. New bad loans created since October 2000 should be disposed of by September 2003.In yesterday's trading December index of leading economic indicators stood at 30.0 below 50 mark for the seventh straight month, suggesting the economy continues to suffer from declining consumer spending and capital investment while industrial output remains weak. As the BoJ starts its two day meeting this Thursday and Friday there are some market rumors that the central bank could adopt a positive inflation target. USD/JPY resistance is eyed at 134.0, 134.40 and 134.80. Support is seen at 132.0, 131.50 and 131.25.  EUR/USD is trading around 86.80, falling from a one week highs of 87.30 in spite of better-than-expected showing in the Eurozone Services index that broke above the key 50-level to 51.0 in January from the previous 49.2, thus denoting an expansion in the sector. The EU business climate indicator also improved to -1.03 from -1.21, marking its strongest reading since last September. Bank of France Governor Trichet remarked later that French growth would be better in January than in December 2001, corroborating the optimism suggested by the indicators.The euro was hurt after  Bild newspaper  announced that German January unadjusted unemployment rose by 326,000 to 4.29 mln, thereby lifting the unemployment rate to 10.4% in January from 9.6% in December. Support holds at 86.35, 86.0 and 85.55-- the 71.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.95. Resistance is viewed at 87.50, 88.0 and 88.30.   Tomorrow morning's release of US Q4 productivity is forecasted to surge to 2.9% from the previous 1.5%, as a result of a reduction in hours worked. Meanwhile, unit labour costs are seen to fall to its lowest level since Q4 '99 to 0.7% in Q4 '01 from the previous 2.3%. Recall that strong US productivity has been attributed as the main reason behind the dollar's sustained strength despite the US economic downturn and the current account deficit. Thus markets will be awaiting the productivity data to determine whether the dollar's strength is justified.  This week's other key US indicators include jobless claims, consumer credit and wholesale trade. From the Eurozone, major economic releases consist of German unemployment, ECB rate decision, German manufacturing orders, German industrial production and Dutch CPI. UK indicators comprise the NTC/FRES Report on Jobs, housing starts, industrial production and the Bank of England's rate decision. Highlights from Japan are the ESRI Tokyo consumer sentiment, money supply, wholesale prices and machinery orders. Over the weekend, currency traders will be carefully monitoring any developments at the G7 meeting in Toronto for any mention of the weak yen or strong dollar policies.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

The quality of the reports is not good.

NAPM) (exp 51, prev 49.6)  The yen challenged overnight 2-week highs of 131.80 against the dollar and pushed to a day's high of 114.40 against the euro despite upbeat economic data from the US and Eurozone over the past week. Yen strength is based on hopes and fears and not sound economic fundamentals. But the dollar's recent failure to benefit from strong data and Wall Street's surge has left bulls feeling uncertain. Therefore, currencies continue to trade familiar ranges with trends hard to find.  The European majors gave back some of their overnight gains against the dollar despite positive services PMI data from the Eurozone and UK. E12 services index expanded for the second month in a row rising to 51.5 in February from 51.0. New business also rose to 50.6 from 49.7, indicating the first rise in new business since the summer. The news raises hopes that a Eurozone economic recovery is around the corner. The data showed France and Italy leading the recovery, while the rate of decline eased in Germany.   More importantly, unemployment improved to 8.4% in January despite how weak output has been. Coupled with stronger than expected E12 PMI data and a further gain in consumer confidence the ECB is expected to keeps rates unchanged at 3.25% on Thursday. In fact, financial markets are already pricing in a quarter percentage point ECB rate rise by June. The German DIW institute head also doesn't expect more ECB rate cuts in this cycle, saying the next move is up.  Bank of France head Jean-Claude Trichet reiterated on Tuesday his view that a strong euro was ""in the best interests"" of the euro zone economy. But traders were hard to convince as they pushed EUR/USD to a day's low of 86.73 after twice failing to maintain above 87 cents. The pair gave up overnight gains and could fall back towards last week's 3-week low of 86.25 if it is unable to break resistance at 87.15. Traders are not encouraged by Eurozone prospects and sentiment is again turning bearish enough to target a move through 86.30/15 on its way to its 6-month low of 85.63. But technical indicators are mixed. Support is seen at 86.60, 86.30, 86.15, and 85.60. Resistance is viewed at 87.10, and 87.85.  GBP/USD also fell to a day's low of 1.4204 after twice failing to break strong resistance seen at 1.4240. Resistance is eyed at 1.4240, 1.4280 and 1.430. Support holds at 1.4180 and 1.4130. A break of 1.4110 would put 1.4045 under pressure and be seen as a bearish signal. Sterling was also unable to leverage good services PMI data into gains after Britain's dominant services sector expanded for the second month running in February to 51.5 from 51.0. The figures also support the consensus estimate that the BoE, which also meets on Thursday, will keep rates unchanged this week at a 38-year low of 4.0 percent.  Moreover, indications from today's PMI data show that both input prices and prices charged in the UK and E12 have fallen over the last month, which will reassure central bank members that monetary tightening to contain inflation is not a pressing concern.  Meanwhile, JPY resumed its recent rise and targeted the key 131.85 mark against the dollar today for the second time this week. Its difficult to ascribe a good fundamental reason from the strength. But traders attribute it to Monday's 5.9% rise in the Nikkei to a 6-month high of 11,450, repatriation fears and hopes that Japan may finally tackle its non-performing loan problems. Recent measures to support Japanese asset prices also gives Japan's capital-weak banks a needed (if artificial or temporary) boost ahead of mark to market fiscal year end on March 31.  Were USD/JPY to break key support at 132.00/131.80 it would have a bearish implication for the pair and would open up a downside target of 130.45. But the recent sell off may have bottomed again at the 131.80 mark, where stop loss orders are being protected. Upside capped at 133.0, 133.50 and 133.70, 134.00/10, 134.70/85 and strong resistance at 135.15. Support holds at 132.20 and 131.80.  Despite USD losses across the board on Monday, US stocks soared on hope that the US economy is on the verge of recovery based on recent affirmative economic data. The Dow skyrocketed 2.1% or 217 points to 10586 and NASDAQ rose 3.1% or 56 points to 1859. Therefore, dealers will look to see what today's services PMI data says in US. Both European figures showed modest gains after breaking back above the 50 mark into expansion in January. US non-manufacturing ISM survey is expected to break above the key 50-level to 51.0 in February from the previous 49.6, thereby indicating growth in the services sector. While this is a positive confirmation for the improvement in the US economy, reaction in FX markets is likely to be muted ahead of Thursday's monetary policy speech by Greenspan and Friday's key US labor market report.

"(02-29) Silver and Gold Options Expiration Operational Procedures","Notice No. 02-29
February 4, 2002

TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing
Members

The expiration date for the March 2002 options contract for Silver (SO H2)
and Gold (OG H2) is Friday, February 8, 2002.

	GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.


	TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


Trading in the March 2002 Silver and Gold Options Contracts will cease at
1:25 P.M. and 1:30 P.M. respectively on February 8, 2002.  All Brokers and
Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions to exercise
or abandon such Options by 3:30 P.M.

On Friday, February 8, 2002, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 4:00 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special ""OLTE"" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:30 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Friday's submissions and processing will be
available on Monday morning February 11, 2002.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
(""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:30 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

Store Sales (exp n/f, prev -0.3%) At 12:30:00 AM Japan Sept Supermarket Sales (exp n/f, prev -5.2%)  The dollar reached a two-month high vs. the yen of 123.03 but later in the trading pared its gains and is trading around 122.60 yen after newly reported anthrax cases. The yen weakened vs. the dollar after government survey released overnight showed Japanese consumer confidence tumbled 4 points to its lowest level in three years to 36.9 in September, amid negative perceptions regarding employment and income. In addition, the yen fell against the dollar and euro after a statement by Toyota VP Araki that the firm plans to exchange almost $20 billion worth of cash reserves from yen into other currencies in order to increase investment outside of Japan. A Toyota spokesman later stated that the reserves could vary depending on Toyota's investment plans. However, such a large transaction would further weaken the yen. The Finance Ministry revealed that trade surplus fell 43% in the first half of this compared with the same period last year, due to fluctuations in the business cycle and increased strength in other Asian countries. Also supporting the falling trade surplus is decline of the US economy, the biggest Japan export partner. The ruling party in Japan is planning to propose a plan to strengthen the role of the Resolution and Collection Corp. held up over the time limit of bad loans disposal: LDP is pressing for three years limit while Komeito party has advocated for five years deadline. Support stands at 122.45, 122.27 and 121.87. Upside capped at 123.30, 123.50 and 123.85.   The single currency benefited from more anthrax scare in the US, rising form a six-week lows to $0.8900 in spite of further decline in euro zone economies. Italian business confidence fell to its lowest level since 1962, to 84 in September from the previous 96. Also the euro was undermined by flow in insurance payments from European insurers to the US after the September 11 attacks. Traders are likely to sell the euro ahead of Thursday's ECB meeting because of its apparent reluctance to cut rates by 25-bp to shore up growth in the flagging European economies. But today's release of preliminary inflation from Germany and Italy indicated that price pressures are easing and will therefore give the ECB flexibility to reduce rates before the end of the year. Data from 3 German states suggested that the national inflation rate is falling towards the ECB's 2.0% target, while data from Italian cities suggested the overall Italian inflation rate is on course to slip to 2.5% in October from the prior month's 2.6%. Resistance is seen at 89.20, 89.55 and 89.80. Support is viewed at 88.60, 88.20 and 87.80.  The swiss franc fell vs. the dollar but later recovered due to anthrax after the European Union defined limits on the use of Swiss financial aid to bail out SwissAir in accordance with the EU's transportation agreements. Overnight, the Swiss franc plunged to a new 6-week low of 1.6682 as markets mulled the Swiss franc's image of safe heaven currency that was tarnished by the SwissAir insolvency. Any subsequent appreciation in the Swiss franc arising from safe-haven flows will likely expedite further rate cuts. The SNB has already eased rates twice to around 2.25%, and economists forecast another 50-bp reduction in store before December to bring its target rate down to 1.75%. Support is seen at 1.6565 and 1.6525. Upside capped at 1.6640, 1.670 and 1.6740.   The White House's Hubbard noted that it is too soon to say that the US economy is in a recession, even though Q3 and Q4 GDP are ""particularly adversely affected"" by the September 11 attacks which could have a potential long-lasting effect on business and consumers. Therefore, while the probability of a US recession has risen ""substantially"" since the attacks, Hubbard tempered his statement by remarking that any US economic downturn will likely be ""quite modest"". US stocks retreated from positive territory after news of more anthrax cases, sending the Dow down 36 points to 9340 and NASDAQ down 3 points to 1704.      	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Issing said that the Central Bank should focus on restraining inflation and the ECB President Duisenberg, in a separate statement said that controlling inflation remain bank's  main focus . Overall market sentiment was not improved by Fed Chairman Greenspan's testimony to Congress indicating the US economy faced weakness. The White House's Lindsey said today the US will probably see ""small negative"" GDP in Q3, therefore making it likely the US economy will have 2 quarters of negative GDP and officially be in a state of recession. Further fueling market concern about the US economic outlook that sent the stocks lower were confirmation that 31 of Senator Daschle's staff tested positive for anthrax exposure and a new possible case of anthrax contamination of New York Governor Pataki's Manhattan offices. Eurozone HICP fell to 2.5% y/y in September from the previous 2.7%, drawing near the ECB's 2.0% interest rate target. The single currency can continue to weaken vs. the dollar after Friday's Ifo business climate index, which is expected to decline to a new 5-year low of 88.1 from the previous 89.5. A weak Ifo reading will renew the pressure on the ECB to cut rates to address falling demand, and should the ECB choose to prioritize price stability over growth, the euro will likely suffer as a result. Upside capped at 90.65, 90.90 and 91.25. Support stands at 90.10, 89.90 and 89.60.  The dollar eased vs. the yen trading around 121.25, after reaching overnight levels of 121. 79 just a bit off its one month high reached on Tuesday, amid markets speculation that Japanese authorities would once again attempt to depreciate their currency by buying foreign assets. Finance Minister Shiokawa stated his desire the Bank of Japan would halt a protracted decline in prices by continuing its monetary policy easing. Shiokawa's comments followed those from Bank of Japan governor Hayami who said it was inappropriate for Japan to set a target on providing liquidity and that monetary easing would have little impact while Japan's structural problems remained. President Bush urged Japan to accelerate its economic reform package, including disposal of bad loans. Shiokawa said that 30 tlrn yen bond issuance cap may not apply to war on terrorism. Shiokawa added that he is still not sure how much money Japan will need to help the US led military campaign against Afghanistan. Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum decided to start in November the next round of multilateral talks under the WTO. Resistance is seen at 121.80, 122.0 and 122.50. Support at 121.0, 120.50 and 120.15.   US stocks plummeted on new cases of anthrax, shrugging off the upward momentum generated by positive earnings reports from IBM and Intel. Dow plunged by 1.6% or 151 points to 9232 and NASDAQ fell by 4.4% or 75 points to 1646 in its largest daily drop since April 23. Major economic data due this week from the US include the Philadelphia Fed Survey, CPI and international trade. Economists in a recent Reuters survey expected the Philadelphia Fed Survey due for release tomorrow to plummet to -15.3 in October from -7.3 in September, corroborating the dire straits of the manufacturing sector which has contracted for 10 straight months by remaining below the zero level. In a separate Reuters poll, economists predicted that Friday's release of CPI will reflect the rise in oil prices and climb to 0.3% in September from the previous 0.1%. Most economists believe that inflationary pressures remain subdued because of the economic slowdown. Mild inflation will allow the Federal Reserve to continue to ease monetary policy to address the US contraction that likely worsened after the September 11 attacks. Key indicators from the Eurozone are the ECB monthly bulletin and Germany's IFO business climate survey. From the UK, markets await economic data this week including money supply, balance of trade and retail sales.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

The dollar has gained 4.4% vs. the single currency and 6.2% vs. the yen since September 11. The yen is likely to be further undermined vs. the dollar on Monday trading after Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed that September industrial output fell 2.9% from a month earlier, worse than the markets forecasts of 2.5% drop. The ministry noted that industrial output continues to be on a declining trend. Future movements about the outlook for final demand will be highly scrutinized. Analysts believe the July-September GDP will contract for the second straight quarter to bring the Japanese economy into a recession, following the decline in April-June GDP to -0.8%. Government officials said they were in the midst of compiling lowered economic forecasts to reflect the global downturn worsened by last month's terrorist attacks. The Bank of Japan will meet for a regular policy-setting meeting on Monday, but is unlikely to take action as it waits for the government to implement structural reforms to salvage the recession-bound economy. The Nikon Keizai Shimbun noted that more consumers are spending less as the economy worsens and unemployment rises bringing the index to its lowest level since 1991.The government is plans to open the mailing service to private businesses in a step-by-step manner in fiscal 2003. The privatization of the postal services is one of the key reforms initiated by PM Koizumi. The ruling LDP candidates won the House of Representatives by elections in Miagi and Shiga prefectures on Sunday, helping the ruling party recuperate its simple majority in the 480 seat lower house, which lose in a general election last year. Support stands at 122.60, 122.32 and 122.0. Resistance is eyed at 123.35, 123.65 and 123.90.   The euro is trading around $0.8930 undermined from Friday's release of Eurozone M3 data, which skyrocketed to 7.6% in September from 6.7%. The 3-month moving average also rose to 6.9% from the previous revised 6.5%. The Bank of France's Trichet expressed his confidence the euro would appreciate. Analysts believe that the ECB's reluctance to ease monetary policy even in the face of an economic downturn is likely to put the euro under considerable selling pressure and see $0.8850 as major support.  However, statements from ECB officials would seem to suggest the bank is mulling over a rate cut in the future, particularly as price pressures continue to subside, and new evidence confirms the deteriorating economic performance of the Eurozone. German Chancellor Schroeder said Friday, we must do everything possible to encourage investment that will create jobs. Support is viewed at the 89.0-cent figure, followed by 88.50 and 88.20. Upside capped at 89.50, 89.80 and 90.10.   This week the key US indicators are the Conference Board Consumer Confidence survey, Real GDP, Chicago Purchasing Managers Survey, personal income and consumption, National Purchasing Managers Survey, and the labor market report. From the Eurozone, economic highlights include France's INSEE industry survey, PPI, CPI, French unemployment, and Euroarea PMI.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

I have not received anything from anyone in London or anywhere else regarding positions, etc.

I did speak with a Weil bankruptcy lawyer and there were many issues especially with respect to ENA positions (and I don't know where the high value credit positions are booked).  They believe that we may have structuring issues working through London and not directly with a purchaser.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's        Interest Rates  US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%        [IMAGE]   	 [IMAGE]  EUR/USD Collapses to 6-Month Low as Dollar Reins Supreme January 25, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8663 $/JPY..134.34 GBP/$..1.4139 $/CHF..1.6976  EUR/USD Collapses to 6-Month Low as Dollar Reins Supreme by Jes Black  At10:00:00 AM US Dec Existing Homes (exp 5.2 mln, prev 5.21 mln)  The ice finally broke under EUR/USD this morning after tripping stop loss orders around 87.35 on its way to a 6-month low of 86.70. The euro suffered a one-two punch this week on disappointing remarks from ECB president Duisenberg which contrasted with upbeat comments by Fed Chairman Greenspan. Markets were pleased by Greenspan's admission that he believes the worst has past. But players were unenthusiastic by Duisenberg's assertion that interest rates are on hold for the time being and that Germany's rising budget deficit was a further concern. By straight-jacketing Germany, the ECB has nearly assured markets that the economy's engine of growth will continue to lag behind the rest of the Eurozone.  EUR/USD has plunged nearly 2.5% since Duisenberg's comments on Wednesday. But the break below key channel support at 87.40/50 brought about a technical decline to a new 6-month low of 86.70. Support at 86.80 must now hold to avoid targeting 86.50 on its way to 85.55 the 71.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.95. Temporary moves higher are not seen by the market as indicating strength, and are regarded as selling opportunities, dealers say. Follow up support is seen at  87.0 and 86.80. Resistance is viewed at 88.15, 88.60 and 89.10-- the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96.  Sterling and the Swiss franc dropped in tandem with the single currency against the dollar after breaking below support at $1.4200 and 1.6775 francs respectively. EUR/GBP was the only upside to an otherwise tragic day for the single currency as it rose to a 3-week high of 61.21. Across the board sterling weakness sent GBP/USD to a 7-week low of $1.4165 while GBP/JPY fell 1.5 yen to a day's low of 190.86. GBP/USD also suffered a technical defeat today after breaking below 1.4220/00. Support is seen at 1.4160 followed by 1.4113 which marks the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of last years move from 1.3680 to 1.4829.  USD/CHF rose to a one-month high of 1.6937 and now faces resistance at the December 26 reaction high of 1.6945. A move beyond 1.6945, which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement of last year's July high of 1.8221 to the September low of 1.5670, will be key for further gains in Swissy. Support is seen at 1.6880 and 1.6840.  USD/JPY also rose to a new 39-month high of 134.93 in Tokyo trade as falls in the yen have lead to asset sales by foreigners which has lead to a vicious cycle of further yen weakness. Moreover, fears that Japan's sovereign-debt rating will soon be downgraded has convinced most dealers that there is further weakness in store for JPY. Resistance is seen at 135.00 followed by 135.40 and 136.00. Support is seen at 134.50 and 133.80.  The fundamentals behind today's move reflect growing optimism about a turnaround in the US economy. Thursday's testimony by Fed Chairman Greenspan showed a rare admission of error in his previously downbeat assessment of the economy. Greenspan said that the forces restraining the US economy are diminishing and activity is beginning to firm. But he also projected that the US is close to zero GDP growth and that there will need to be signs of business investment and strong consumer demand for the recovery to gather momentum.   The only domestic economic release of note today is the National Association of Realtors' existing home sales report, which is expected to show that housing activity weakened slightly by 0.1% in December to bring the total to 5.2 mln from 5.21.  Today's earnings announcements are not as heavy as the past two days and include Ericsson LM Telephone and Lockheed Martin.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

In thin trading due to US holiday, market focus is shifting to a meeting between the US Treasury Secretary O'Neill and Japanese Finance Minister Shiokawa scheduled at 7:15 pm EST. Although traders do not expect the forex to be the main topic of the conversation, some think that O'Neill might say something to approve the present government policy over weak yen. In yesterday's trading the BoJ published the minutes of their November 29 meeting, showing members voted 8-1 to ease monetary policy. Moreover, a Japan MoF official urged debate on BoJ buying of foreign bonds as a way to weaken the yen. Given BoJ Governor Hayami's increasing concern with deflation, it is likely that the central bank could soon increase the money supply, allowing the yen to depreciate further. The number of Japanese corporate bankruptcies in 2001 was the second highest since the 1945 while total liabilities fell 30.8% from the record high in 2000. The number of corporate failures last year jumped sharply after Mycal went bust and business sentiment deteriorated in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the U.S. in September Japan's Financial System Minister Yanagisawa stressed PM's Koizumi's determination to take every possible measure to avoid volatility in the financial system during a Monday meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill. During the meeting, Yanagisawa told O'Neill that Japan now has a secure safety net, after going through the 1998 financial crisis. Yanagisawa also referred to a system that allows the government to inject up to 15 trillion yen worth of public funds in case of a financial crisis. Concerning the issue of bad-debt disposals, Yanagisawa told O'Neill that the Japanese government aims to take final steps to separate bad loans from banks' assets in two to three years. Moody's announced Monday it has changed the rating outlook for 10 major Japanese banks from stable to negative, due to concerns over probable negative effects of the planned April abolition of the government's full guarantee on deposits at failed lenders. Finance Minister Shiokawa said Monday the government plans to avoid a deflationary spiral with a second supplementary budget for fiscal 2001, which is also aimed at speeding up the economic structural reform initiatives of PM Koizumi. In December the government compiled a package of economic programs worth 4.1 trillion yen ''to accelerate economic structural reform and avoid the economy's deterioration with increasing speed along with continuing deflation . Support is seen at 132.0, 131.80 and 131.60. Resistance is eyed at 133.0 and 133.35.  EUR/USD is trading around 88.30 weighed by the third straight fall in Eurozone industrial production to -0.8% m/m in November from the previous -0.4%, or to -4.3% y/y vs. the previous -2.7% in its largest annual decline since July 1993. The data bodes poorly for Q4 GDP figures, and thus centers markets' focus on the European Central Bank. German FinMin Eichel said that German budgetary deficit policy did not face any criticism on Monday's euro group meeting. Eurogroup's Rato believed the ECB thought economic downturn scenario not too worrying. Rato added that appropriate policies have been adopted to help recovery. EU's Solbes said euro zone structural deficits would improve in 2002 and 2003 while the euro zone CPI is likely to fall under 2% in Q1. Although the Bundesbank's Welteke reiterated the ECB's insistence on keeping monetary policy unchanged, many analysts believe the ECB will lower rates by 50-basis points over the next few months now that inflation has fallen to the 2% target rate. In addition, all ears will be tuned in to European Central Bank President Duisenberg's testimony on Wednesday before the EU's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee for any hints about future interest rate cuts and the Eurozone economic outlook. Resistance is seen at 88.80, 89.50 and 90.0. Support is viewed at 88.0, 87.50 and 87.0.  The major event of this week will be Fed Chairman Greenspan's testimony before the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday since markets are anxious to hear his remarks on the economy and any clues they might glean about the central bank's monetary policy. In particular, economists believe that Greenspan's testimony may also be supportive to the dollar following a report in the Washington post that according to Fed sources, Greenspan ""sounded more pessimistic than intended about the prospects for U.S. economic recovery"". According to the sources, the Fed Chairman is likely to comment more positively about the current state of the US economy, and therefore markets are now pricing in less than a 30% chance of a rate cut at the Jan 30 meeting, leaving the majority to believe rates will be held steady at a 40-year low of 1.75%.  This week's other key US indicators include jobless claims and existing home sales. Fed Chairman Greenspan's testimony before the Senate Budget Committee will be the major event of the week, with markets cautious to hear his remarks on the economy. From the Eurozone, major data due for release consist of Euroarea foreign trade, HICP, French CPI, Italian industrial orders, Euroarea labor costs, German CPI, Italy's ISAE consumer confidence survey, ECB monthly bulletin, German PPI, Italian CPI, Italy's ISAE industrial confidence survey, Italian retail sales and Spanish PPI. Economic highlights from Japan comprise the trade balance, index of tertiary sector activity, corporate service prices and consumer prices.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Leading Indicator (exp -0.4%, prev -0.3%) At 2:00:00 PM US Sept Fed Budget (exp 28.6 bln, prev -79.9 bln)  The dollar added to last week's gains, rising across the board in both Asian and European trading this morning. EUR/USD revisited Friday's low of 89.67 while the dollar continued to test heavy resistance around 121.70 yen. Dealers drove the dollar higher for both internal and external reasons. Helping the dollar was the US equity market's resilience last week in the face of the first barrage of Q3 corporate earnings reports. Anthrax scares also failed to move the market by the end of the week, thereby helping the dollar despite the obvious risks of bio-terrorism. With the risk-aversion problem fading for the dollar, dealers have reassessed relative growth rates amongst the majors and found the US economy to have better long-term prospects.   Weakness in the other major currencies can be attributed to the underlying market perception that aggressive fiscal and monetary policy will pay off for investors who bet on the US recovery. Last Friday's German Ifo survey added weight to that view. The September survey posted the worst figure in 8 years and the biggest point decline in 28 years, as it fell to 85.0 from 89.5. This put the market on recession watch, as it reinforced fears of a possible contraction in German growth for Q4, which would put even Finance Minister Eichel's 0.75% 2001 growth target at risk. The Ifo report has also shaken confidence that the Eurozone economy would outpace the US over the near-term and has increased the risks of a contraction in the Eurozone, even though a technical recession is still unlikely. According to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development's latest release, the outlook for world economies is now the worst since 1982. US 2002 growth was revised down to 1.3% from the earlier 3.1%, while EU 2002 growth forecast was revised to 1.5% from 2.7%.   Falling economic growth has led to rising budget deficits and higher unemployment in the Eurozone. This has put the European Central Bank under intense pressure to lower rates, and it will again be at the forefront of investor thought when it meets this Thursday. But even though the Ifo survey was very bad, European Central Bank members did little to calm investors' nerves last week. This will likely keep pressure on the euro as markets gauge whether or not the ECB will appease politicians and businesses with another rate cut. However, even if the ECB were to lower rates, the market reaction could be muted because it has already been priced in for some time now. Therefore, the euro again finds itself in a lose/lose situation because the ECB has failed to be promote growth. Moreover, according to data released from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, since October 9, when EUR/USD was trading around 92.20, there has been a 20% unwinding of euro long positions by non-commercial accounts. But the market is still long euro and the heavy selling could continue if the ECB does not cut rates.  EUR/USD maintained above yesterday's low at 89.67. Follow-up support is seen at 89.43, the descending channel support line from 93.35, followed by 88.40, the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 83.48 to 93.45. EUR/JPY managed to recover most of Friday's losses, to regain the 109 level. Strong resistance is still seen at 109.50 but further weakness in the Japanese economy will help to push EUR/JPY higher.   The yen also fell against the dollar to a day's low of 121.70. A sharp year-on-year decline in Japan's trade surplus in September and a further drop of 0.1% in the MITI tertiary sector index sent the yen tumbling across the board. However, dealers say that the market has grown resistant to trading the yen lower because the constant stream of gloomy economic data is now expected. Therefore, more rangebound trade is expected in the yen this week.  GBP/USD hit a fresh two-month low of 1.4315 as traders also came to favor the US economy's prospects over that of the UK. Sterling has now confirmed its break below the 1.44 level, which is the key 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 1.37 to this month's 8-1/2 month high of 1.4836. A sustained break of the August 28 low of 1.4375 is seen increasing the bearish outlook for sterling. But, sterling's five-cent slide in two weeks may move into a stabilization period this week as investors contemplate the recent sell-off. Boding well for the pound is the fact that the Bank of England appears ready to ease monetary policy again in order to bolster economic growth. The decline in September inflation below the 2.5% target will provide the central bank with leeway to cut interest rates again by another 25-bp this year and the BoE's willingness to spur growth (unlike the ECB) will benefit the pound. Support holds at 1.4320, 1.430 and 1.4265. Upside capped at 1.4420, 1.4450 and 1.4480. Against the euro, the pound also fell to a one-week low of 62.73 pence.  USD/CHF regained Friday's highs around 1.6450 before easing back again, but is still seen supported above the key 1.64 level. The dollar's ability to maintain above 1.63 will be needed for it to maintain its bullish trend as it targets the 1.65 level. However, any major negative developments for the US, at home or abroad, would quickly translate into gains for the franc.  No key data was released from the Eurozone or UK today making trade quiet as dealers await the US leading indicators due at 10:00 AM. The negative impact from rising jobless claims and falling stock prices is expected to push the leading indicators figure down 0.4% in September after a 0.3% fall in the previous month.  Meanwhile, dealers will look to see if the dollar holds up as well as it did last week in the face of poor earnings reports for Q3. About half of today's earnings announcements will come after market close, thereby keeping trading volumes light in the regular session. One major sector represented in earnings announcements after the bell today is financials, like Moody's. Because of this, dealers may look to the war in Afghanistan for an indication of the effectiveness of the US ground operation as troops search for Osama bin Laden. The general lack of direction from Wall Street kept Asian and European bourses relatively unchanged today, albeit in positive territory. US futures are down slightly ahead of the open.

We have our own form of corporate resolutions.  It was being circulated for signature by the directors and I just received it back today.  I told Kelly Keneally when I sent the documentation to her that we were in the process of routing this for signature and that I would send her a certificate certifying these resolutions when completed.

Daniel:

What about the limitation of liability language which you suggested could
be similar to the PB agreement (your 9/20/01 email)?

      Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
      amending
      the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

      Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose
   the
      language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

      I trust this will now close the open issues.

      I look forward to hearing from you

      Kind regards

      Daniel:

      Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
      relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.
      If
      you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
   and
      we
      can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International Chamber
   of
      Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be non-prime
      brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and, therefore,
      are
      not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do have
      other
      business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
      limitation
      of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

      ""Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or
   from
      any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect,
   special,
      punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage.""

      Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of
   the
      office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

      All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
      executed
      together with the terms of business letter.

      Regards.  Sara

         Sara

         The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
      relationship
         with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues that
      relate
         to
         the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects with
   the
      PB
         relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

         Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are adequately
         addressed
         in the documentation as drafted.

         I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as
   possible
      so
         we
         can try to get this wrapped up today.

         Kind regards

         Daniel:

         Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the PB
         conflict
         because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with
   Par.8
         requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to the
      Terms
         of
         Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts
   prevail.
         Are
         you agreeing with this analysis?

         Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to
   conflict
         with
         the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the
   PB
         (except
         for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It is
      Enron
         Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit
   the
         Terms
         of Business in the same manner.

         Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
      suggest a
         different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the the
         remaining

            Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke.
   Arbitration -
         more
            appropriate to general terms of business which principally
         contemplate
            the
            regulatory rules to which we are subject (SFA rules). In the
   event
      of
            inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause
   A3).

            I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

            Daniel:

            Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
      ""Agreement"")
            with my colleague Angela Davis.

            I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter
         relating
            to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we
   discussed
      but
            were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

            (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J, Par.
   14
      of
            the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the possible
   use
      of
            arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration in
   the
         OSLA)
            so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of
      the
            Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to
   English
         courts,
            I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which
   will
            prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

            (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
      manner
         as
            Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe
   that
      you
            and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
      shouldn't
            these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

            I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of
   the
            account documentation.  Regards.

Prod. m/m prel (exp 0.5%, prev 1.5%)  The yen regains some ground vs. the dollar, after falling to a 2-1/2 week low of 135, due to remarks from Vice Minister Kuroda's that Japanese currency is unlikely to drop sharply. The yen was hurt on markets' disappointment that the final release of Prime Minister Koizumi's anti-deflation package offered few real solutions to tackle the severe problems facing the economy. The package called the BoJ to further ease monetary policy, which the central bank may do on today's meeting. (Increase bond purchases to 1 trln yen from current 800 mln). The government did not call for mandatory injection of public funds into banks, but rather opted to use that choice in case of a substantial financial crisis. As far as bad debt loans are concerned, the government asks RCC to play key role in bad loans cleanup. All together, anti deflation program is a disappointment and even high ranking LDP member Taro Aso said that he thinks  measures are insufficient . Now all eyes are on BoJ policy meeting tomorrow and their possible decision regarding bond purchases. If the Central Bank give in to govt. request, the yen is likely to weaken further. The repatriation flows are probably the only reason what keeps the yen from falling to 138-140 levels vs. the dollar but in two weeks when most of the overseas funds are brought home the Japanese currency will likely resume its fall. Japan Jan prel. ind. output fell 1% from the previous month (and worse than forecasts of 0.6% gain) Jan prel inventories down 1.1% m/m . Feb manuf. output seen up 4.7% m/m March manuf. output seen down 0.9% m/m Japan's METI said ind. output continues to be in a declining trend. Resistance is eyed at 135.0, followed by the 3-year high of 135.15. Support holds at 134.0, 133.60 and 133.20.  Today, Fed Chairman Greenspan's rationale behind his slight optimism was due to inventory behavior as a key sign that the economy is at a turning point, since as the inventory cycle runs its course, consumer spending and income could receive a lift. Greenspan remarked that although spending will increase, an economic pick up might be more limited than compared with past recoveries. He expects Q4 productivity to be revised higher, and revealed that the Fed's central tendency for US real GDP is between 2.5-3.0% in 2002. The Fed's central tendency for the PCE Price Index is roughly 1.5% this year, and its central tendency for the US unemployment rate in 2002 is between 6.0-6.25%.  EUR/USD is trading around 86.60 after declining to a session low of 86.26 against the dollar, weighed in European trading by an unexpected decline in German Q4 GDP to -0.3% q/q from the previous -0.2%. The German data posted its first annual drop of 0.1% for the first time since 1996. In spite of the dismal data, German Finance Minister Eichel commented that the economy had already reached a bottom, and consequently, he believes that all indicators point to a surprisingly strong recovery. In spite of the slowdown in the Eurozone's largest economy, analysts do not believe the European Central Bank will change rates when it meets next week to determine monetary policy, especially in light of the rise in M3 to 8% from the previous 7.8%. Both the EU's Prodi and the EcoFin's Rato declared that the economy is in good shap and will recovery in the latter half of the year, thus negating the need for changes in current monetary and budget policies. Upside capped at 87.0, 87.40 and 87.80. Support is seen at 86.0, 85.50 and 85.0.   Currency markets will now look to tomorrow morning's releases of US GDP and Chicago PMI for further clues about the state of the US economy. Q4 '01 GDP is expected to be revised upwards to 0.8% from the advanced reading of 0.2%, boosted by stronger spending and helped by the better trade deficit. Later in the morning, traders will assess the Chicago PMI that will likely foretell of a breakthrough in the ISM PMI on Friday. Chicago PMI is forecasted to rise to 47.7 in February compared with the previous month's 45.1 as conditions in the Midwest manufacturing region continue to improve.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Watchers survey (exp 29  prev 29.6)  USD/JPY rose by three-fourth yen to a session high of 132.08 and Japanese currency weakened by more than three-fourth yen to a session low of 116.59 against the euro, after Finance Minister Shiokawa said overnight that Japan was not deliberately driving the yen down. The Bank of Japan expected decision to leave monetary policy unchanged had little impact on the yen. The BoJ raised current account deposit target at 10-15 trln yen. Therefore, the buying foreign assets may not be a viable policy option if the market continues to push JPY lower. The yen was also hurt after director general in the MoF Mizoguchi said the currency's fourth month slide is a result of poor Japanese economic outlook. Economic Minister Takenaka said that Japan's exports, is showing signs of bottoming and is starting to bounce back, although the overall economy continues to deteriorate. Minister's report announced that the economy is in its second straight month of contraction, with consumer spending and corporate capital investment remaining low. Takenaka was hopeful that the US growth would help recovery of Japan: ""I think the recovery of the U.S. economy will be faster than expected,"" the minister said. LDP Sec-General Yamasaki said that weak state of Japanese stock market reflect pessimistic outlook investors have about the economy. Yamasaki added that the government and the ruling coalition needed to have a clear outlook for the economy, saying that currently, the economy is in a ""deflationary recession."" Japan November current account surplus rose 19.4% fro a year earlier to 1.125 trln yen. The trade surplus shrank 16.9% to 640.1 bln yen.  Resistance is eyed at 132.70 and 133.20. Support holds at 131.0, 130.80 and 130.50.  The euro rebound to 88.45 after falling to a to a 2-1/2 week low of 88.04 cents due to alleged sell-off by Spanish banks in order to cover their exposure to the Argentinean financial crisis. The single currency rose lifted by the EUR/JPY rise and after EU's  Solbes remark that he believes the euro will bring better economic growth. Resistance at 88.50, 89.50 and 90.0. Support is viewed at 88.0, 87.50 and 87.0.  The release of yesterday's strong US retail sales figures sparked hope that the US economy is on the road to recovery. The dollar held fairly steady against the majors following the release of industrial production data that came in slightly below but within expectations. US Industrial production eased to -0.1% in December from the previous -0.3% for the fifth consecutive monthly decline. The Capacity Utilization rate slipped to 74.4% vs. the previous 74.5% to its lowest rate since April 1983. Similarly, US manufacturing output rose to -0.1% in December from the previous -0.2%, while its corresponding capacity utilization rate edged down to 72.8% from 72.9%. US stocks tumbled on negative earnings announcements by JP Morgan Chase and Intel Corp, which revealed that it would slash capital spending in 2002. The Dow plunged to its lowest level since late November 2001 by 2% or 211 points to 9712. NASDAQ fell by 2.8% or 56 points to 1944.  Tomorrow's US jobless claims are expected to rise to 426k from last week's 395k due to underfiled claims in California because of a new law. The rise may be offset slightly by the re-opening of auto factories after a winter close and decreased layoffs in the retail sector. Also due for release in the next US session is housing starts, which are forecasted to decline slightly to 1.6 million from the previous 1.645 mln though holding fairly strong. Housing permits are estimated to edge up to 1.6 million in December from the previous 1.595 mln.  The US Treasury Department announced Wednesday a plan to meet with the representatives of the National Association of Manufacturers to discuss the effect of strong dollar policy. Last week NAM Vice President Vargo requested a meeting with the US Treasury Undersecretary for Int. Affairs Taylor to complain that the strong dollar policy is hurting the exports and slowing down the recovery of the US economy. Vargo thinks that the dollar is currently overvalued. In the recent months the dollar has strengthened against major currencies despite the  US economic slowdown.       	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

I wanted to run this by you, since all of our templates are now under your review.  This is new language that I need to add to our templates -possibly after the ""rounding language"" section.  Once you approve this, I will make that change.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Brent Hendry just informed me that the following language should added to all financial templates.

Corrections to Published Prices.  For purposes of determining the relevant prices for any day, if the price published or announced on a given day and used or to be used to determine a relevant price is subsequently corrected and the correction is published or announced by the person responsible for that publication or announcement, either Party may notify the other Party of (i) that correction and (ii) the amount (if any) that is payable as a result of that correction.  If a Party gives notice that an amount is so payable, the Party that originally either received or retained such amount will, not later than three (3) Business Days after the effectiveness of that notice, pay, subject to any applicable conditions precedent, to the other Party that amount, together with interest at the Interest Rate for the period from and including the day on which payment originally was (or was not) made to but excluding the day of payment of the refund or payment resulting from that correction.

We can talk about this.

Thanks,
Melissa

The goal of moving the contract to terminated status has been accomplished and I doubt they will pay anything now considering we have agreed to begin settlement discussion.  Furthermore, I don't want to irritate the situation with them.

	As a reminder, position adjustments for both NYMEX and COMEX

prior to the first business day of the delivery month, and throughout the
delivery month.  Therefore, all position adjustments of concurrent futures
positions for the March 2002 metals contracts must be completed prior to
February 14, 2002.

	Additionally, position adjustments of concurrent futures positions
for NYMEX Division energy contracts are not permitted during the last three
trading days of the respective contracts.  Rules 9.04(P) and 4.37(A) are
attached.

	If you have any questions concerning this matter, please contact
Nick Galati at (212) 299-2920, Nick Falcone at (212) 299-2919, or Bonnie

NYMEX RULE 9.04 - CLEARING PROCEDURE

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may
not be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other
bookkeeping procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor
transactions in accordance with Exchange Rules. Provided, however, that a
clearing member will be exempt from this requirement if: (I) one side of the
concurrent position is established the business day prior to the date that
the offset memoranda are filed with the Clearing House; (II) a clearing
member filing such offset memoranda can satisfy the Exchange at its request
that the delay in effecting the offset is attributed to an error in the
filing of its clearing sheets; and (III) by 10:30 a.m. on the same date that
a clearing member files such offset memoranda, the clearing member also
files with the clearing house an updated and accurate Long Open Interest
Report.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 9.04(P), the current delivery month for
energy futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the third
business day, prior to termination of the respective futures contract,
including the termination date. The current delivery month in platinum and
palladium commences on the tenth (10th) business day prior to the first
business day of the delivery month.

COMEX RULE 4.37A - CONCURRENT FUTURES POSITIONS

(1) Concurrent long and short positions in the current delivery month may
not be offset by netting, transfer, expit, adjustment or any other
bookkeeping procedures, but each side must be offset by normal floor
transactions in accordance with Exchange Rules. Provided, however, that a
clearing member will be exempt from this requirement if one side of the
concurrent position is established the business day prior to the date that
the open positions are filed with the Clearing House.

(2) For the purposes of this Rule 4.37A, the current delivery month for
metals futures contracts commences on the open of trading on the tenth
(10th) business day, prior to the first business day of the delivery month.

"(01-437) NYMEX ACCESS and C-21 Frame Relays","Notice No. 01-437
December 20, 2001

TO:		All ACCESS/C21 Frame Relay Users

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	NYMEX ACCESS
 and C-21 Frame Relays


Thank you for your patience and understanding concerning the frame relay
equipment issue.  I'm pleased to inform you that the Exchange has made a
final decision on the disposition of this equipment.

Please be advised that AT&T will be contacting you shortly to arrange for
disconnection and removal of the router and modem only for those NYMEX
ACCESS
 and C-21 users connecting to our systems via frame relay.  This is
AT&T's equipment and they will arrange for its pickup.  Users are
responsible for the costs associated with any AT&T equipment that might be
damaged or lost.

All NYMEX ACCESS
 terminal holders must contact their telephone carrier to
arrange for the discontinuance of phone service to their terminal.  Since
the user set up the account with AT&T, they are responsible for contacting
the carrier and making arrangements for this service to be discontinued.
The Exchange will not do this.  This should be completed as quickly as
possible since the Exchange will not pay for any reimbursement costs
incurred after December 31, 2001.

Finally, with reference to the NYMEX ACCESS
 and C-21 terminal equipment
itself, the Exchange requires that NYMEX ACCESS
 and C-21 frame relay
holders write or email the NYMEX Customer Service Call Center (NCSCC) with
their intention to return the equipment to the Exchange at their own cost,
or to keep the equipment and continue using it for NYMEX ACCESS
  and / or
C-21 usage.

To contact NYMEX Customer Service, call: #1-800-438-8616 or e-mail:
CUSTCARE@nymex.com.
To send your response via post, please mail to:
New York Mercantile Exchange
Customer Service Department
World Financial Center
One North End Avenue
14th Floor
New York, NY 10282
Attention: Robert Dagistino, Director and/or Mildred Rodriguez, Business
Analyst

Should you decide to keep the equipment and continue to use C-21 and/or
NYMEX ACCESS
, please be advised that effective December 31, 2001 any
license granted to the C-21 and NYMEX ACCESS
 software programs or any
third-party software that may be accessed via the terminal equipment shall
terminate.  Any use of these software programs after that date or any
copying or re-distribution of these programs is strictly prohibited.  To
continue using the equipment, you must format the hard drive and install any
operating system that supports Internet Explorer 5.1 or greater.

Should you have any questions please contact the NCSCC at 1-800-438-8616 or
e-mail at CUSTCARE@nymex.com.

Thank you for your continued support.

Please be reminded that Thursday, February 28, 2002, is the First Notice

Furthermore, the manufacturers' group declared its desire to meet with the US Treasury next week to discuss the dollar's strength, since they believe it is hindering an economic recovery. The yen's depreciation has raised objections from other Asian nations concerned it will hurt growth by crimping their exports. December domestic wholesale price index remained unchanged from last month. The index is down 1.4% from a y/y for the 15th consecutive month of year on year decline. December M2+CD  rose 3.4% from a year earlier.Prime Minister Koizumi also added to the brouhaha about the yen's exchange rate by saying that Japan was not deliberately weakening the yen, but instead, markets were determining what was an appropriate level. In response, Malaysian PM Mahathir said he was watching with interest the impact of the yen's fall on the Chinese yuan and ASEAN currencies. Koizumi is currently visiting Southeast Asia and is likely to encounter scrutiny from regional trading partners who are undoubtedly wondering how low the yen will drop and thus hurt their export competitiveness, and whether it would spark a round of devaluations. Ex-Japanese Minister of Finance Sakakibara, known as Mr. Yen, also said in the previous Asian session that he expect the yen might fall to 150-160 per dollar towards year-end. However, Sakakibara warned of possible intervention if the dollar rises above the psychological level of 140 yen. In reference to Bank of Japan policy, Sakakibara said the bank should keep easy monetary policy including more JGB purchases, but warned that excessive government spending would be ineffective and could lead to a collapse in the JGB market. Support is viewed at 132.0, 131.50 and 131.0. Resistance is eyed at 132.70, 133.0 and 133.40.   The euro is trading around 89.10 after German industrial production came weaker than expected but did not move the single currency considerable. Industrial production fell below forecasts to -1.6% in November from the previous month's -1.2%, or to -4.8% y/y in November from the previous -3.2%. Economists fear that weakness in Germany could weigh on Eurozone GDP, which was revised to 1.4% in Q3 from the previous 1.3%. However, growth in Q4 could tumble to 0%, thereby putting pressure on the European Central Bank to cut interest rates in February to spur an economic recovery in the European region. Support is seen at 89.0, backed by 88.80 and 88.60. Upside capped at 89.55, 89.80 and 90.0.  This week's remaining US indicator is PPI, which is forecasted to rise to -0.2% in December from the previous -0.6% but remain below zero for the third straight month as energy and food prices continue to decline. Core PPI is projected to edge down to 0.1% in December from 0.2% in November, in a reflection of how overall inflationary pressures remain mild.     Markets will pay careful attention to Fed Chairman Greenspan's speech tomorrow for any mention about the US outlook, as it will be his first speech on the economy since last October. Highlights from Japan consist of wholesale prices, money supply and the ESRI Tokyo consumer sentiment survey.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's        Interest Rates  US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%        [IMAGE]   	 [IMAGE]  FX Trade Subdued, Markets Look To Greenspan January 11, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8919 $/JPY..132.09 GBP/$..1.4434 $/CHF..1.6586  FX Trade Subdued, Markets Look To Greenspan by Jes Black  At 8:30:00 AM US Dec PPI y/y (exp -1.6%, prev -1.1%) US Dec PPI m/m (exp -0.2%, prev -0.6%)  US Dec PPI ex food energy (exp 0.9%, prev 0.9%) Event: At 1:45 PM Fed Chairman Greenspan speech  FX markets were relatively quiet today as the majors kept within yesterday's ranges. European bourses were mixed and the lack of economic data kept traders away from taking decisive positions ahead of the weekend. Most subdued was EUR/USD, which continues to move within a tight range of 89.10 to 89.30. Meanwhile, markets listened to more remarks from Japanese officials that the yen's fall was nearing its limit. JPY rose to a day's high of 131.88 vs USD and 117.67 vs EUR, but failed to make a decisive break past the key levels of 131.50 and 117.50 which would herald more corrective yen buying.  Overnight, Japanese Trade Minister Hiranuma said that with the dollar approaching 135 yen, the pair was approaching is limit. On Thursday, Ex-Japanese Minister of Finance Sakakibara, aka Mr. Yen, also warned of possible Japanese intervention if the dollar rises above the psychological level of 140 yen. However, said he still sees the yen possibly falling to 150-160 per dollar towards year end.   The recent change in JPY sentiment from talking it lower to trying to stabilize its fall has two motivations. First, the Japanese dislike sharp falls in their currency and prefer gradual moves, which appear more stable. In addition to the yen's 10% decline over the past 2 months, PM Koizumi is currently on a 7-day tour around Southeast Asia, which began on Wednesday. Therefore, the political implications of a weak yen divisive, with ASEAN economic ministers worried that that the weakening in the yen could create malaise in other Asian markets. Therefore, for political reasons Japanese officials are now likely to remain quiet until the PM returns.  This temporary shift in sentiment has caused a bout of profit taking and a period of consolidation would not be unusual following the yen's steep fall. But any correction in USD/JPY would likely hold around 130-132 dealers say before the next push higher. EUR/JPY fell to a day's low of 117.76 but has importantly held above Wednesday's low of 117.50. Only a break of this mark would target last week's lows around 116.90 and the 2-week low of 116.50. Upside is seen capped at 118.75 and last week's 2-year high of 119.71.  CHF broke out of a tight 20 pip trading range against the dollar and rose to a day's high of 1.6578 following hawkish remarks from an Indian army chief over the prospect of war with Pakistan. EUR/CHF also fell to a low of 1.4785 from highs around 1.4840.  GBP/USD rose to a session high of 1.4452, but again failed to maintain gains above the key 1.4440 level. Sterling, like the euro, has continued to trade in a tight range against the dollar this week, thus reflecting the market's indecision about the rosy prospects for the US economy. Overnight, GBP fell from a high of 1.4460 to a low of 1.4370 despite strengthening against the dollar on Thursday after the Bank of England decided, as analysts expected, to leave interest rates unchanged at a 37-year low of 4.0% because of signs of robust consumer and housing spending. The BoE's decision underlines the better performance of the UK economy relative to other G7 nations. Nonetheless, the pound continues to be undermined by market speculation about the UK joining the EMU. Support holds at 1.4370, 1.4340 and 1.4320. Resistance is seen at 1.4465, 1.450 and 1.4550. Against the euro, resistance at 61.70 held today, which should keep sterling's gains in check.  Meanwhile, EUR/USD price action was subdued as it hovered in a tight 20 pip range of 89.11 to 89.31. The pair continues to move within a channel from 88.70 to 89.50 as it hovers around the key 89.10 level, which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. This level is significant in that it reflects an equilibrium in supply and demand condition between euro and dollar. Overnight, the pair briefly tested resistance at 89.35, but was rejected. Now, failure to maintain above 89.10/20 would probably call for a test lower to 88.70 followed by 87.60, which marks the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the same move. Moves higher are not seen by the market as indicating strength given the euro's difficulty to remain above 90-cents. But given the mixed data from the Euro area and the US, investors are seen waiting on the sidelines ahead of the latest round of earnings reports from the US for better direction.  Meanwhile, markets will be looking for signs of economic recovery in the US and more gains on Wall Street after two days of diverging finishes. On Thursday, the Dow fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq rose 0.1% ahead of next week's corporate earnings reports which overshadowed better-than-expected retail and economic data. Dealers will watch to see if U.S. markets are getting ahead of themselves in anticipating a U.S. recovery, meaning that share prices may be overvalued.  Markets will pay careful attention to Fed Chairman Greenspan's speech today for any mention about the US outlook, as it will be his first speech on the economy since last October.   Today's US indicator is PPI, which is forecasted to rise to -0.2% in December from the previous -0.6% but remain below zero for the third straight month as energy and food prices continue to decline. Core PPI is projected to edge down to 0.1% in December from 0.2% in November, in a reflection of how overall inflationary pressures remain mild.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's        Interest Rates  US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%        [IMAGE]   	 [IMAGE]  USD Recoups Losses, But Gains Limited on Market Holiday January 21, 2:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8834 $/JPY..132.64 GBP/$..1.4354 $/CHF..1.6619  USD Recoups Losses, But Gains Limited on Market Holiday by Jes Black  US Financial Markets closed for Market Holiday.  The dollar recouped the majority of its losses against the majors in light trade on Monday after profit taking trading pushed the dollar to a one-week low of 88.66 cents against the euro and a 4-day low of 132.05 yen. But currency movements stabilized after Tokyo caught up with the dollar sell off in Friday's US session and traders in London took a breather due to decreased volume ahead of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday in the U.S.   There was little economic data from Europe today to move the markets. But the euro area's industrial production figures for November showed a larger than expected decline to -4.3% from -2.7% in October, the biggest y/y drop since July 93. It was the third consecutive decline and raises the question of whether the European Central Bank will lower rates oat its next meeting on February 7 given that inflation is now at their 2% target rate.  Markets will also ponder the direction of US rates this week as Fed Chairman Greenspan is scheduled to speak before the Senate Budget Committee on Thursday. The much-publicized columnist, John Berry, wrote in Saturday's edition of the Washington Post that Greenspan ""sounded more pessimistic than intended about the prospects for U.S. economic recovery, according to several Fed sources."" Therefore, markets are now pricing in less than a 30% chance of a rate cut at the Jan 30 meeting, leaving the majority to believe rates will hold steady at 1.75%, a 40-year low. The dollar appreciated over 6% last year vs the euro and economists are now divided over whether a further rate cut would help the dollar.   EUR/USD rose to a 1-week high of 88.66 in Tokyo trade, after breaking through resistance around 88.50. The high also marked the 200-day moving average and was not broken after plunging below that level following last Tuesday's 2-cent drop. The single currency then eased slightly in London trade to support at 88.36. The real test will be on Tuesday to see if it can add to Friday's gains after falling 2% vs USD and JPY last week. The EU's statement on Friday that Eurozone GDP for 2001 could have fallen to a level between -0.3% and 0.1% is likely to keep pressure on the euro and only a break back above 89.50 is seen improving the chances of the single currency after it hit a 3-week low of 87.91 last Thursday. Key support is seen at 87.50, which marks the 31.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.96. Resistance is seen at 88.50 followed by 89.10, which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the same move. Yet, only a move back above 89.50 would give any hope of a near term recovery as temporary moves higher are not seen by the market as indicating strength given the euro's difficulty to remain above 90-cents.  USD rose to a day's high of 132.66 yen after profit taking on Friday's US session and Monday's Tokyo eroded after the dollar held above 132.00 support. USD is still off of Friday's 1-week high of 133.03 but profit taking from recent gains has not changed sentiment over a weaker yen. USD/JPY support is seen at 132.0, 131.80 and 131.60. Resistance is eyed at 133.0 and 133.35.  In Japan, the BoJ published the minutes of their November 29 meeting, showing members voted 8-1 to ease monetary policy. Moreover, a Japan MoF official urged debate on BoJ buying of foreign bonds as a way to weaken the yen. Given BoJ Governor Hayami's increasing concern with deflation, it is likely that the central bank will in the near future futher increase the money supply in some fashion, which would weaken the yen.   Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's remarked on Monday that he was not planning to discuss foreign exchange at his scheduled meetings with Japanese PM Koizumi and Financial Services Minister Yanagisawa later in the day. The yen's sharp fall in recent months has drawn increasing attention after last week's rumblings in SE Asia and China over a weak yen and Friday's complaints by the National Association of Manufacturers over a strong dollar making it difficult to compete with cheaper-priced Japanese goods. But O'Neill and the administration seem ready to tolerate a weaker yen if it means Japan has banks dump bad loans, accelerate reform and deregulate markets, like the US did.  GBP/USD pared earlier gains after hitting a high of 1.4418 in Tokyo and fell to a low of 1.4353 in London trade. Support at 1.4330 is seen as critical. It marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 1.4060 to 1.4606. A break of that level would call upon 1.43 on its way to 1.4267, the 61.8% retracement of the same move. Resistance is seen at 1.4440, 1.4480, 1.450 and 1.4550. Key support is at 1.4330.  Today's data from the UK showed UK public sector net cash requirement (PSNCR) jumped to 9.44 billion pounds in December from 5.4 the previous month. The figure was the biggest monthly shortfall since March 96. This does not mean public finances are in bad shape because Tres Sec Gordon Brown has accumulated surpluses in the past year. Moreover, public sector net debt outstanding was just 318 pounds, or 31.6% of GDP, which is very low figure compared to most other industrialized countries.   USD/CHF rose to a high of 1.6633 after it held above support at 1.6580 following a 1-1/4 centimes loss on Friday in the wake of EUR/USD gains. Technical weakness was also apparent after two attempts to break back through resistance at 1.6725 were thwarted. Support stands at 1.6590, 1.6550 and 1.6520. Upside capped at 1.6725, 1.68 and 1.69.     	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's       Interest Rates   US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   2.0%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.75-2.75%       [IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]  Recent Dollar Gains Give Way To Profit Taking  November 20, 7:00 AM: EUR/$..0.8830 $/JPY..122.90 GBP/$..1.4181 $/CHF..1.6523  Recent Dollar Gains Give Way To Profit Taking  by Jes Black  At 8:30:00 AM US Sept Int. trade (balance BOP basis) (exp -15bln, prev -27.1bln) US Sept Exports (exp 78.3 bln, prev 84.5 bln) US Sept. Imports (exp 93.3 bln, prev 111.6 bln) At 8:40:00 AM US Redbook (exp 1.5%, prev 1.7%) At 10:00:00 AM US Oct Leading Indicators m/m (exp 0.1%, prev -0.5%)  The dollar's rally stalled on Tuesday at 3-month highs around 123.45 yen and 87.70 cents to the euro following overnight comments from San Francisco Fed's Parry that a US economic recovery is unlikely until the end of the first half of 2002. Meanwhile, a confirmation from China that it would increase its allocation of euros in its FX reserves was supportive of the single currency. Some estimated the move may involve as much as 20 billion dollars, but the combined good news for the single currency and bearish news for the dollar still failed to put the pair back above key resistance at 88.40. USD/CHF also held above an earlier low of 1.6506 as it continued to correct from last week's dizzying 5.5-centime gain. USD gave way to heavy profit-taking as dealers also anticipated a possible decline in US equities on Tuesday following impressive gains overnight. Choppy trade ahead of a shortened Thanksgiving holiday week should add to volatility, but USD is not expected to lose its bullish trend any time soon. Ahead of the holiday, traders will look to today's trade data from the US as well as tomorrow's key Ifo survey from Germany.  Dealers will watch today's US trade data which is expected to show a narrowing of the deficit to $15 billion from $27.1 billion in August. Due to the accounting treatment of foreign insurance payments related to the WTC attacks, the deficit could shrink to around $14-15 billion compared to the $24-25 billion that is expected. The $11 billion in insurance payments would have a positive impact on nominal GDP for Q3 GDP due on November 30 and would give a psychological boost to the market. However, this is completely offset in the deflator and does not affect real GDP, which is still expected to fall around 0.9% in Q3. Therefore, since the adjustment for reinsurance claims in nominal GDP is fully offset by the GDP deflator, only the decline in exports which does not count the $11 billion in insurance claims will be counted towards real GDP. Trade flows were disrupted following the 9/11 attacks and reduced both imports and exports, but according to the commerce department, every $1 billion decrease in the September deficit is worth between 0.1 and 0.2 points on the real GDP growth rate.  Meanwhile, the leading indicators index appears to have risen in October by a slight 0.1% after falling 0.5% in September. However, this figure could be distorted upwards due to an irregularity in delivery times.   EUR/USD rose to a session high of 88.38 in European trade, but after its inability to hold onto gains above 88.40 last week, the pair is expected to edge back towards the 88-cent level. On Monday, the euro reached a 3-month low of 87.67 but maintained above key resistance around 87.45. Weighing on the single currency was the Bundesbank's November monthly report which indicated as expected that Q3 growth was flat to negative for the Eurozone's number one economy. No growth in Q2 (-0.003%) also contributed to a year on year growth rate of around 0.25%, down from 0.6% reported in Q2, thus showing that German growth rapidly deteriorated towards a technical recession.   GBP/USD rose to a session high of 1.4190 after trade data came in largely as expected with a September trade deficit of 2.25 billion pounds. Expectations were for a fall to 2.1 billion after August's 3.3 billion deficit. The fall in the September trade deficit was helped by a larger than expected surplus with the US. The figure alleviated some concern in the market since last week's comment by Bank of England member King who pointed out that the current account imbalances might lead to a weaker pound.   Nevertheless, cable continues to suffer from this comment as well as last Wednesday's inflation report by the Bank of England, which signaled a shift in market sentiment towards the pound. The market is now more aware of the weaknesses the UK faces due to the internal and external imbalances in the economy. Moreover, the market fears the Bank is more concerned about future inflationary pressures given that interest rates are now at a 40-year low. Therefore, with interest rates likely to be left on hold just as the labor market is showing its first signs of weakness, the pound has slipped from last week's high around 1.46 to yesterday's 3-1/2 month lows around 1.41. Dealers say cable's break of support at 1.4195 is bearish, and is now targeting the 1.4000 level. Resistance now stands at 1.4195 followed by 1.4220.  Meanwhile, USD/JPY edged back to key support around 122.75 after reaching a fresh 3-month high of 123.45 on Monday. This correction was expected after recent gains, but any selling back towards 122.50 or 122.00 sould not be enough to offset the overall bullish trend. Sentiment continues to underpin USD because of the renewed momentum in US equities as investors show an increasing appetite for risk. The yen also came under additional pressure from mounting worries about the Japanese banking sector ahead of a slew of earnings reports by major Japanese banks later this week. However, it is worth noting that Japanese banking problems can sometimes lead to yen appreciation if those institutions are having to repatriate foreign funds to cover losses. But, with little room for improvement in the Japanese economy until late next year, most market watchers see the yen heading for 125 now that it has successfully breached the 123 mark. Resistance is seen around 123.35/45. But USD/JPY support is expected to hold at 121.40/50, with any pullback towards the latter level seen as a buying opportunity, dealers said.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

Markets could regain optimism that there is still hope for Japan. Bush-Koizumi meeting did not produce any significant impact on forex, but disappointment that Japanese government did not come out with any major plan how to get the economy out of slump. The dollar hit one week high vs. the yen, after Finance Minister Shiokawa said that its not time yet to inject public funds into banks, further disappointing markets about any visible hope for reforms. Restoring the health of Japan's banking sector is one of the most important elements of Japan's structural reforms burdened with mounting bad debt loans. Additionally, head of the LDP task force on anti-deflation measures Aizawa called on the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy when it meets next week by purchasing 200-300 billion yen worth of foreign bonds, increasing its purchases of JGBs and adopting an inflation target. Nevertheless, the injection of liquidity into markets is seen as having a reduced impact on the Japanese economy since banks have made their lending criteria stringent and only severely distressed firms are seeking capital. Finally, the losses in yen will be limited by repatriation flows to Japan ahead of the end of the fiscal year on March 31. During his speech to the Diet, Bush expressed firm support for PM Koizumi's reforms and called for a revival of the Japanese economy. He said how wide-ranging policies such as tax cuts; deregulation and efforts to improve the liquidity of bad loans had helped revive the U.S. economy. Some senior LDP members took Bush's comments as guidance where Japanese economy should proceed. Support is seen at 133.20, 133.0 and 132.50. Resistance is viewed 133.70, 134.0 and 134.45  EUR/USD is trading around 87.60 after rising to a 1-week high of 87.82 in tandem with the 1-yen rise in EUR/JPY to a 1-week high of 117.15. The euro reached new heights on weakness in the dollar and yen, boosted by the fourth consecutive monthly rise in the expectations index of the ZEW German sentiment survey by 14.3 points to 50.2. The current conditions component, however, fell 3.1 points to  87.0. The expectations component of the ZEW indicator for the Eurozone also climbed 13.5 points to 56.6 in a sharp contrast with the current conditions component which edged up a mere 0.2 points to  72.6. ECB council member Quaden said euro is undervalued would rise in medium term, preferred gradual trend. Quaden said euro interest rates are at appropriate level.The single currency was underpinned as well by the rise in Eurozone industrial production to 0.8% in December from the previous month's -0.8% that suggests a turnaround in the sector, even though the annual rate edged up only slightly to -4.1% from the previous -4.3% in a reflection of the still contracting industry. In an interview with Bloomberg, ECB council member Ernst Welteke expressed his concern about Eurozone inflation and money supply, thus appearing to play down the chances for an ECB rate cut since the previous cuts had most likely not yet filtered through the economy. Welteke also questioned Germany's aim of attaining 2.25% growth rate in 2003, since it would depend on the state of the US economy along with the wage round between trade unions and firms. Upside capped at 87.85, 88.10 and the 200-day moving average at 88.50. Support is viewed at 87.0, 86.80 and 86.45/50.  Economists forecasted that tomorrow's release of US CPI most likely rose for the first time in four months to 0.3% in January from the previous  0.2%, while core CPI edged up to 0.2% versus the previous 0.1%. They cited rising gasoline, medical care and housing costs as the reasons behind the climb in consumer prices.  This week's key US indicators consist of CPI, jobless claims, international trade, index of leading indicators, Philadelphia Fed survey and the Federal budget. Eurozone highlights include German GDP, Italy's ISAE consumer confidence survey, Spanish GDP, German CPI, Italian industrial orders, Euroarea balance of payments, Euroarea foreign trade, French GDP, Italian CPI and Spanish CPI. Major data releases from the UK comprise money supply, balance of trade, Bank of England's MPC minutes, and the CBI Industrial Trends survey. Key economic indicators from Japan are general household spending and the index of tertiary sector activity.    	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

"RE: Jefferson Smurfit Corp.","Based on last night's mids...we show that ENA owes $21,541. Deals go out to 2004 and remaining tonnage is approx 22,500. Approx notional difference per ton of $26 seems to be a reasonable bid-offer spread (being that the fixed prices on the deals were $810 and $825).  Bob, do you agree with my assessment?  I cannot imagine 16 Bleached Folding Carton has much liquidity (what the hell is it???). Sara, you may want to forward the calcs to Bob...if we have any other 16 BFC deals (although I have a hard time believing we do) this may be a useful price point for other valuations.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.



	TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


Trading in the February 2002 Copper and Aluminum Options Contracts will
cease at 1:00 P.M. and 1:10 p.m. respectively on January 28, 2002.  All
Brokers and Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions
to exercise or abandon such Options by 3:00 P.M.

On Monday, January 28, 2002, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special ""OLTE"" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Monday's submissions and processing will be
available on Tuesday morning January 29, 2002.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.


CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
(""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the ""Scan Risk"" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 3 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Thursday, January 10, 2002.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN	(1 * $2,500)
=			$2,500
One Short Tier 3 NG or NN	(1 * $2,000)
=		- 	$2,000
Net Scan Risk		($2,500-$2,000)
=			$   500
Spread Rate		(1* $500)
=		+	$   500
Total Requirement
=			$1,000
Scan Risk Example Summary
Margin on a Spread Between a Tier 1 and Tier 3 Futures Contract
Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):
$1,000
Member Customer (Initial Margin):
$1,100
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):
$1,350


 Inter-Month Spread  Margins on Natural Gas and Henry Hub Swap Futures
Contracts
				Clearing

Tier 4 (7th   - 12th Nearby Months): 	 $250				$275
$237
Tier 5 (13th and greater):		$100				$110
$135

The inter-commodity spread margins will be $0 between Natural Gas (NG) and
Henry Hub Swap (NN) futures contracts. Spread credits between Henry Hub Swap
futures and all other NYMEX energy products will be the same as the Natural
Gas spread credits.
Should you have any questions regarding these changes, please contact Arthur
McCoy at (212) 299-2928 or Joe Sanguedolce at (212) 299-2855.  This notice
supersedes all previous notices regarding outright and spread margins for
the NYMEX Natural Gas (NG) futures contract and the NYMEX Henry Hub Swap
futures contract.

"Bus Pass and Parking Information","
FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month

Charts & News featuring Standard & Poor's        Interest Rates  US: Japan: Eurozone: UK: Switzerland:   1.75%  0.15%  3.25%  4.0%  1.25-2.25%        [IMAGE]   	 [IMAGE]  Japanese Forex Trading Preview January 13, 7:00 PM: EUR/$..0.8942 $/JPY..131.82 GBP/$..1.4492 $/CHF..1.6530  Japanese Forex Trading Preview by Darko Pavlovic  No key data  The yen gained against the dollar after Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed asked Japan to stem its currency decline, joining the chorus of Chinese and South Korean officials who already expressed their dissatisfaction with the recent yen fall. Japanese Trade Minister Hiranuma said Friday that the yen was nearing a downward limit of 135 yen per dollar. The recent rhetoric from Japanese officials about the yen's recent decline come as Prime Minister Koizumi's current visit to Southeast Asia. Seems that Japan is attempting to appease its Asian neighbors who have become increasingly vociferous as traders test the yen's downside. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi commented that the ""continued devaluation of the Japanese yen will have an adverse impact on the economic development and financial stability in Asia"", and expressed China's hopes that Japan would take a responsible attitude on the yen to prevent falls in other Asian currencies. Economics Minister Takenaka pronounced that the current exchange rate is not too far off from fundamentals, since in his view the Japanese economy could be faced with more downside in the next 3-6 months. Taku Yamasaki, secretary general of Japan's ruling LDP party said that while current tax rates will remain unchanged or be lowered for the time being, they may be raised in the mid- and long-term in order to achieve fiscal structural reform. U.S. President Bush will make his first official visit to Japan in the second half of February. His meeting with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi will possible be dominated by discussions on how to secure Japan's economic recovery and avert a global recession Support is seen at 131.0 and 130.80. Resistance is eyed at 132.20, 133.0 and 133.40.  On Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan stated the US economy is stabilizing though it continues to face ""significant near-term risk. Therefore, he cautioned against prematurely concluding that the forces restraining the economy have abated even though recent data has become mixed from ""unremittingly negative"". Greenspan noted that energy prices must continue to fall. He opined that the present cycle will be driven by corporate profits and capital investment. Finally, Greenspan commented that it is unclear whether the effects of September 11 on productivity are small or just delayed. Greenspan's speech likely mean that the Fed is maintaining an easing bias, thereby hinting possibly at another 25-bp rate cut to 1.5% at the next FOMC meeting on January 29-30. In fact, Fed Fund futures indicated a 60% chance of a rate cut this January following Greenspan's words. Looking ahead to this week, major indicators due from the US consist of retail sales, business inventories, CPI, industrial production, the Fed Beige Book, jobless claims, housing starts and permit, the Philadelphia Fed survey, international trade, and the University of Michigan confidence survey.   The single currency is trading around 89.43 deriving strength from Greenspan's cautious stance of the outlook of the US economy and Friday's remarks from EU's Prodi who saidthat the euro will be an attractive alternative to the dollar. Prodi also observed there are signs the European economic downturn may be short-lived. Traders will take their cues from next week's key Eurozone data including Spanish retail sales, German ZEW economic sentiment survey, French industrial production, German GDP, Italian CPI, Dutch GDP, Euroarea industrial production and Italian industrial production. Upside capped at 89.80 and 90.0. Support stands at 89.0, backed by 88.80 and 88.60.      	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.

The sharp rise in the dollar against the European majors over the past few trading sessions is based on the belief that this week's US data will show continued improvement. Moreover, President Bush's speech is expected to reflect a bullish outlook on the US economy. This has kept the dollar index hovering near the 120 level today, just shy of its 15-year highs around 121.00.  EUR/USD fell to a day's low of 85.93 in European trade following a failed attempt to break key resistance at 86.35. The single currency now looks vulnerable to fall back below 86.00 on its way to yesterday's 6-month low of 85.72. A break below this would then target 85.55, the 71.8% Fibonacci retracement of the move from 82.25 to 95.95. However, choppy trade over the next few days is likely and the market does not see temporary moves higher as indicating strength. Resistance is viewed at 86.35, 86.50, and the key 87.40/50 level which marks the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the same move.  In a newspaper interview published Tuesday, the ECB's Issing said most studies indicate that the euro is undervalued. However, Issing conceded that the central bank may have underestimated the impact of the US slowdown on the Eurozone economy. In the near term, Q1-Q2 2002 growth is likely to be flat growth and that the euro FX rate will be dependent on progress with EU reforms, which have been slow to make much headway, Issing said.  But holding back the dollar for the moment is the fact that much hope has again been pinned on hopes of a speedy US recovery. Therefore, not only will this week's economic data have to impress, but all eyes will be on the Fed's FOMC meeting which convenes on Wednesday. A strong majority expects the Fed to stay put on rates. But the focus will be on their outlook for the economy and whether they change the easing bias to neutral after an incredible 11 interest rate cuts last year to a 40-year low of 1.75%.   Another point of contention this week will be whether the G7 meeting in Toronto and the World Economic Forum in New York become a sounding board for big global interests to bash the recent resurgence in the dollar. Manufacturers are likely to complain that the state of the economy is now about at the same level just prior to the September 11 attacks, but the USD index is again trading near 15-year highs.  In fact, recent dollar strength gave way to corrective yen buying on Monday as USD/JPY fell 1.5% from its recent 40-month highs around 134.90. The euro and pound crosses fared worse and have fallen 3.75% and 2.5% respectively, since peaking at 2-year highs last Thursday.   BoJ Governor Hayami helped push the yen higher following a break in the usual weak yen rhetoric by MoF officials. Hayami reiterated his opposition to a weaker yen, arguing that a softer currency is not a solution to Japan's problems and that manipulating the yen lower would undermine Japan's credibility. However, Hayami's comments are not seen as carrying that much weight because it is widely known that the MoF conducts FX policy, not the BoJ.  Nevertheless, given the rapid fall in JPY over the past 2 months and the subsequent consolidation, some dealers warn of further corrective buying in the yen before a renewed fall will push JPY below recent lows. Some dealers expect a reversal in USD/JPY back as far as the 130 mark. But before that happens, current support at 132.80 and 132.40 will have to give. Meanwhile, the upside is capped at 134.00, 134.50, and 134.90.  Despite any technical correction in the JPY bear trend, the currency is more likely to succumb to its weak economic fundamentals. Today, Japan's unemployment rate climbed to a record high for the fourth straight month in December to 5.6%, up from 5.5%. It was the highest rate since unemployment records began in 1953. Separate data showed average spending down 4.4% in December from a year earlier. Moreover, GDP is expected to contract by 1% in this fiscal year (ending in March) and the government has forecast 0% growth for FY2002.  GBP broke out of today's tight trading range and fell to new day lows against the dollar and yen. GBP/JPY is now testing support around one-month lows of 187.00. Sterling has now dropped over 2.5% against the yen since last Thursday's 2-year highs around 192.20. GBP/USD also fell to a day's low of 1.4045, just above overnight 6-month lows of 1.4043. Support is seen here, followed by 1.3980 and 1.3930.  Finally, today's key data is the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence survey which is expected to rise to 95.4, from 93.7 in Decmeber. However, because it is scheduled one day before the FOMC decision on interest rates, the markets reaction is likely to be muted. Durable goods orders are also expected to rise by 0.9% in December after falling 4.8% previously. But inventory depletion is unlikely to lead to a sharp recovery.rd high for the fourth straight month in December to 5.6%, up from 5.5%. It was the highest rate since unemployment records began in 1953. Separate data showed average spending down 4.4% in December from a year earlier. Moreover, GDP is expected to contract by 1% in this fiscal year (ending in March) and the government has forecast 0% growth for FY2002.  On Monday, the Japanese government said that consumer sentiment remained weak in December amid rising corporate bankruptcies and record high unemployment. Deflationary pressure also persists as retail sales in Japan fell 5.7% from a year earlier in December for the ninth straight month of decline, showing how falling incomes and are weighing on spending as consumers become more uncertain about the economic outlook.  JPY is also likely to remain under pressure in the near term as ratings downgrades and rising bond yields steer investors away from Japanese assets. The Bank of International Settlements said Monday the outstanding balance of overseas loans and investment by Japanese banks was up some $40 billion from the end of June. Moreover, banks are unloading Japanese bonds in order to book profits before the fiscal year ends on March 31. Foreign investors have also sold bonds as the falling yen has created a currency risk too great for the scant return of Japanese bonds.  USD/CHF also remained above support at 1.7020 which is key for further gains. Follow up support stands at 1.6945, which marks the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the same move. On Monday, Swissy rose above resistance at 1.7075 to a new 5-month high of 1.7173. Swissy is now seen targeting 1.7245, which marks the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of last year's July high of 1.8221 to the September low of 1.5670.  	[IMAGE] Audio Mkt.
