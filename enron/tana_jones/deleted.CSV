Floor and Clearing
Members - Shortened Hours
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the November 2001 options contract for Aluminum (OA
X1) is Thursday, October 25, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.


TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


The following schedule of operational procedures is based on shortened
trading hours as described in Notice to Members # 01-333
(http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/2001/ntm_333.htm).

Trading in the November 2001 Aluminum Options Contract will cease at 1:05
P.M. on October 25, 2001.  All Brokers and Traders must inform their
Clearing Members of their intentions to exercise or abandon such Options by
3:00 P.M.

On Thursday, October 25, 2001, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special ""OLTE"" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Thursday's submissions and processing will be
available on Friday morning October 26, 2001.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
(""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 8:00 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

October 23, 2001

TO:		ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
		ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBER FIRMS
		ALL COMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM: 	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	Approved Amendments to COMEX Rule 4.94, ""Settlement Price
Procedures for Copper Contracts""


The Exchange has complied with regulatory requirements by filing with the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission amendments to COMEX Rule 4.94,
""Settlement Price Procedures for Copper Contracts"".  The approved amendments
to Rule 4.94 modify the settlement price procedure for the current delivery
month by taking into consideration, not only the weighted average price
(rounded to the nearest minimum fluctuation) of all outright transaction
that occur in the closing range, but also the weighted average for all
spreads executed and all spread bids and offers actively represented between
the most active month and the current delivery month during the final thirty
minutes of trading.

A copy of the amended Rule 4.94 is attached.  These Rule amendments will
become effective on Monday, October 29, 2001.

Should you have any questions please contact Michael Campanelli at
212-299-2072, Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608 or Ploumi Efkarpidis at
212-299-2334.

Approved Rule Amendments
(Asterisk indicates additions: bracketing indicates deletions)

Rule 4.94	Settlement Price Procedures for Copper Contracts.

	(A)(i) The term ""base month"" shall mean the March, May, July,
September, and December delivery months; (ii) the term ""most active month""
with respect to this rule and the rules of COMEX Chapters 11 and 17 shall
mean the base month that is not the current delivery month, with the
greatest reported open interest on the official COMEX daily open interest
report.

* (B)   The settlement price for the current delivery month shall be
comprised of the weighted average price (rounded to the nearest minimum
fluctuation) of all outright transactions that occur in the closing range
combined with the weighted average price of all spreads executed between the
current delivery month and the most active month and all spread bids and
offers between the current delivery month and the most active month actively
represented during the final 30 minutes of trading.  If no outright
transactions occur in the closing range or no spreads are executed or there
are no spread bids and offers actively represented during the final 30
minutes of trading in the current delivery month, the settlement price shall
be the last trade price, unless during the closing range a bid higher or
offer lower than the last trade price is made.  In such event, such higher
bid or lower offer shall be the settlement price. *

	[(B)] *(C) *  The settlement price for the [current delivery month
and the] most active month shall be the weighted average price (rounded to
the nearest minimum fluctuation) of all outright transactions that occur in
the closing range.  If no outright transactions occur in the closing range
of [either the current delivery month and] the most active month, the
settlement price [for the applicable month] shall be the last trade price,
unless during the closing range a bid higher or offer lower than the last
trade price is made.  In such event, such higher bid or lower offer shall be
the settlement price.

	[(C)] *(D)*  In all other delivery months, the settlement prices
shall be determined based upon spread relationships between and among
contract months, which relationships shall be determined in the judgment of
the Settlement Price Committee with:  (a) greater weight given to spreads
executed late in the trading day in large volumes, and (b) lesser weight
given to (i) spreads traded in lesser volumes, (ii) spread bids and offers
actively represented late in the trading day, and (iii) spread transactions,
bids and offers from earlier in the trading day.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no settlement price shall be established that would be lower than
the best outright bid, or higher than the best outright offer, that:  (a)
was for at least 20 contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and
had remained available for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes
of trading of that trading day.

	[(D)] *(E)*  If any settlement price, determined pursuant to
Paragraph [(C)] *(D)*, is inconsistent with transactions that occurred
during the closing range for other delivery months of the same futures
contract or with other market information known to the Committee, the
Committee may establish a settlement price at a level consistent with such
other transactions or market information.  In such event, the Committee
shall prepare a written record of the basis for any settlement price so
established.

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations, COMEX Division

RE:		Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day


Please be reminded that Monday, December 31, 2001, is the First Notice Day,
for the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of January

diligence involving Spot Month Trade processing may result in severe
disciplinary action by the Exchange.

"(01-448) EXCHANGE TO CHANGE EARLY CLOSING TIME FOR COAL","Notice No. 01-448
December 28, 2001

TO:		ALL EXCHANGE MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS
		ALL CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:	J. ROBERT COLLINS, JR., PRESIDENT

RE:		EXCHANGE TO CHANGE EARLY CLOSING TIME FOR COAL

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., announced today that it will change
the early closing time for coal futures to 12:30 P.M. for days that the
Exchange has designated for early closings.

These days include December 31, 2001, and January 18; February 15; May 24;
August 30; and December 24 and 31 in 2002.

The change reflects the abbreviated trading hours under which the Exchange
has been operating since September 17 and will remain in place until the
hours are extended. All other open outcry energy markets except propane
futures will continue to cease at 1:00 P.M. on those days. Propane futures
close at 12:15 P.M.  The early closing for aluminum and palladium will
remain at noon; silver and copper will end at 12:05 PM on those days; and
gold and platinum will close at 12:10 P.M. Electricity futures will close at
its regular time of 9 A.M.

"(01-357) On-Going Air Quality Testing","
Notice #   01-357
October 26,  2001
 
TO:                   All Members, Staff and Occupants of One North End  Avenue
 
FROM:             Vincent Viola, Chairman
                          J. Robert Collins, Jr., President
 
SUBJECT:       On-Going  Air Quality Testing
 
 
 
Air Quality Update
 
 
Air quality testing within One North End Avenue has been  and will continue to be the first priority for the management of this  exchange.  The Exchange has engaged  Ambient Group, Inc., an extremely reputable independent laboratory specializing  in this area, to monitor the Exchange's air quality including tests for  transmission electron microscopy (TEM), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons,  Acenaphthene, Acenaphthylene, Anthracene, Benz (a) anthracene, Benzo (a) pyrene,  Benzo (b) fluorathene, Benzo (ghi) perylene, Benzo (k) fluoranthene, Chrysene,  Dibenz (a,h) anthracene, Fluoranthene, Flourene, Indeno (1,2,3 cd) pyrene,  Napthalene, Phenanthrene, Pyrene, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead,  Manganese, Nickel, Silica, and Zinc.   Air quality tests were performed on September 14th, 20  th, 26 th, October 4 th, 9 th, 12  th, 16 th, 18 th, 23 rd, and  26th, and, to date, all results have been well below the EPA, OSHA,  ASHREA, and ACGIH levels.
 
The Exchange has also taken a pro-active approach on  testing for dangerous chemicals outside the building, as a result of the tragic  events that have occurred in the past six weeks.  Ambient Group, Inc. has secured a  high-volume air sampling monitor (one of only four available to commercial  buildings in New York City) that tests for Benzene, Dioxin, P.C.B.s, as well a  large variety of other air borne chemicals and is based on EPA guidelines.  The Exchange has been testing for these  chemicals for the past few weeks and the first results will be available by next  week.  
 
Going forward, all test results will be posted and made  available to all building occupants on a weekly  basis.
 
Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to  contact Elliot Zuckerman, property manager, at (212)  299-2242.

"(01-350) Copper Options Expiration Operational Procedures","Notice No. 01-350
October 22, 2001



TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and 			Clearing Members - Shortened Hours
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the November 2001 options contract for Copper (HX
X1) is Friday, October 26, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


The following schedule of operational procedures is based on shortened
trading hours as described in Notice to Members # 01-333
(http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/2001/ntm_333.htm)

Trading in the November 2001 Copper Options Contract will cease at 1:00 P.M.
on October 26, 2001.  All Brokers and Traders must inform their Clearing
Members of their intentions to exercise or abandon such Options by 3:00 P.M.


On Friday, October 26, 2001, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special ""OLTE"" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Friday's submissions and processing will be
available on Monday morning October 29, 2001.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
(""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 8:00 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

"(01-356) Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day","Notice No. 01-356
October 26, 2001



TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations, COMEX Division

RE:		Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------

Please be reminded that Wednesday, October 31, 2001, is the First Notice
Day, for the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of
November 2001 (the new spot month).

On Tuesday, October 30, 2001, the Eve of the First Notice Day, all Brokers
and Clearing Members must have a duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry
(""OLTE"") system trained representative available until such time as the
Exchange deems necessary.

It is imperative that trades involving the Spot Month are processed and
cleared properly.  Therefore, representatives are expected to make a
diligent effort to process all Spot Month trades accurately.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to show due
diligence involving Spot Month Trade processing may result in severe
disciplinary action by the Exchange.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

Subject: 

We have now received a new Password Application  and ETA amendment for the referenced counterparty.  As of the close of business today, we have shut down Bankers Trust Company for EOL trading.  All EOL trading should now be done through the referenced entity.  Enron has executed a Novation Agreement which is currently at Deutsche Bank for execution.  Per DB, we should receive the executed copy back from them on Monday.  Upon receipt of this Novation Agreement, all of the current Bankers Trust financial trades will be moved under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between Deutsche Bank AG and Enron North America Inc. dated  12/29/00.

Global Counterparty:  Please ensure that the ISDA Master referenced above is attached to this counterparty in EOL.

Confirmation Desk:  Please ensure that all EOL financial confirmations show this counterparty as ""Deutsche Bank AG, acting through its New York Branch""

MUCH THANKS!!!

Subject:	Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage


To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

"This week's tasting, Cabernet Value Sampler, Friday","Good morning wine lovers,
I trust all of you will have a safe and happy new year and come to see us next year!!!  
Always sounds strange to say 'see 'ya next year', no?  Anyway, on to the business at hand.  Starting in 2002, I am going to experiment with something.  It seems that all of you on our email list are quite regular with your visits to our tastings.  Therefore, I will be announcing the weekly wine seminars through this service only.  Sending our schedule in the mail just doesn't seem nearly as cost effective as this email service.  So, starting now, I will inform everyone of the Thursday topic on Monday.  Let's see how it goes.
Immediately following the Thursday wine tasting topic you will find an awesome sampler case.  This case contains the winners from last week's tasting with a special price.  If we can continue to stock the best wines from the Thursday tastings, this trend will continue.  That is, the sampler will contain the highest scoring wines from the previous week's Thursday night tasting, unless we sell out of those wines in the tasting.  

THURSDAY, JANUARY 3RD, 2002

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"New Temp IDs","Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on ""Outlook Today"" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on ""View"" and
	then ""Folder List"")

2.	Left Click on ""Properties"" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the ""Permissions"" tab

4.	Left click on ""Add"".
	Type ""EWS""-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the ""Add"" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click ""OK""

5. 	You should now be back in the ""properties"" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the ""Shift"" key, then

December 26, 2001

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS

RE:		EXCHANGE TO EXTEND NATURAL GAS TRADING HOURS TOMORROW

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will extend trading in its natural
gas futures and options contracts to 2:45 PM from their regular closing time
of 2:30 PM. in response to a change in schedule, due to the holidays, of the
release by the American Gas Association (AGA) of results of its weekly

The rescheduling of the announcement coincides with the expiration of the
January natural gas futures contract.  The Exchange had previously announced
that trading in natural gas futures and options will be extended until 2:45
whenever the expiration of natural gas futures occurs on a Wednesday, the
regular release date of the AGA report.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

All,

We are currently working on the data model for the Trading Agreements System and have a question pertaining to internal/external counterparties.  Are all agreements between an internal company(counterparty) and an external company(counterparty)?  I spoke with Meredith Stewart (the data architect for this project) and she found an agreement between 2 internal counterparties, e.g. Enron Louisiana and ECT.

Please let me know ASAP.

>
> CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES
>
> 1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as
> accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
> close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
> estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate
> adjustments.  The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.
>
> 2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
> option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be
> subject to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is
> submitted advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or
> all of its position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).
> All other options series in the expiring month will be subject to
> automatic abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.
> When submitting an E/A form, please note the following:
>
> (a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
> (b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
> are subject to automatic
> 	Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in strike
> prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
> (c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
> strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a
> position in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to
> notify Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have
> an officer available to confirm such intention.
> (d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
> to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.
>
> 3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
> purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
> If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
> position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
> expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
> projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
> actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and
> cancel correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions,
> therefore do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction
> trades.
> The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
>
> 4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
> may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
> house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
> prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade
> entry system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department
> of COMEX (""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than
> 2:30 PM.
>
> 5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
> be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.
> Problem trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must
> be corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct
> supervision of Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later
> than 2:30 PM.
>
> 	*****
> A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
> process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing
> Department:
> 1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
> report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
> based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
> CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
> close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
> adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
> gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for
> clearance on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR
> transactions which have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and
> trade information submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this
> report will also reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment
> instructions, the projected number of exercises and maximum potential
> assignments for each strike price, the type of exercise (manual or
> automatic), whether the strike is In, At or Out of the money, and the
> exercise value associated therewith based on settlement prices established
> by COMEX on the day of expiration.
>
> 2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
> expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
> day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
> Prior to 2:30 PM.
>
> Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report
> and transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether
> trades have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by
> COMEX's On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.
>
> B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
> including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
> COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
> Clearing Department.
>
> C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
> Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.
>
> D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
> will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
> Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
> options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
> assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement
> carefully.  Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or
> more will be automatically exercised, not all short option positions will
> be assigned if there are any options manually abandoned at such strike
> prices.  Please note that there also may be some at or out-of-the money
> options being exercised.
>
> E)	At approximately 8:00 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
> available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.
>
> It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
> properly trained to handle the option expiration process available
> beginning at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific
> times.  It is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports
> and to notify the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.
>
> To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
> members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement
> time will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.
>
> Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
> reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
> Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.
