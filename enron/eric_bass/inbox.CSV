Dear icruise member,
Although we have had some snow in New York, everyone's mood at I-Cruise is sunny. January blues? Not with these amazin' deals!
If you can't find a room on Burbon Street for Mardi Gras then here's your chance to sail on the Rhaspsody of the Seas on 2/9/02.. You'll get two full days of fun in New Orleans over Mardi Gras for only $629 including port-limited space so book right now.
To me, there's nothing better then planning your summer vacation now and having some time to look forward to it. Celebrity's beautiful Constellation has a great itinerary in August for 13 fantastic days in Europe.. For only $1699 including port, it's a real deal on a brand new ship.
And, the Carnival Spirit has an incredible price for a 7 day Southbound Alaska trip.. $833 including port is outrageous.
I knew these rates would chase your blues away!

"[Footballguys] Update # 164 11-28 Week 12 Rushing Matchups","
/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Hi Folks,

Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com (will be
posted soon) for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.
I always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green
may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky
Williams or Marshall Faulk, Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up
against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box
when it comes to deciding between players.

Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.
http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position
numbers are from ESPN.com.
Let's get to it.

Joe

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the
Offense.


Baltimore's Moe Williams vs Indianapolis Defense

With Jason Brookins' unfortunate injury, Moe Williams is handed the chance
of a lifetime.   A month ago, he was stuck behind Terry Allen and Brookins.
Now, he's likely the guy who'll be asked to carry the rushing load for the
defending World Champs.   I'd expect you'll see FB Obafemi Ayanbadejo to
play a larger role.   Williams had already started becoming a much bigger
part of the passing game catching 4 passes for 47 yards last week.   He also
had 9 carries for 31 yards (3.4 ypc)   I think he'll do fine.   The Colts
are reeling.   Their defense ranks # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last 4 weeks and for the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.   You saw how Garrison Heart ran wild on them last week.


Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Jacksonville Defense

Start Ahman Green.   He rolled for 102 yards on 22 carries last week and
looks as solid as ever.   Jacksoville is ranked # 21 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks as if you needed another reason to
start him...


New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs Carolina Defense

Ricky Williams struggled a bit last week but still finished with 56 yards on
15 carries (3.7 ypc) and a TD.   He also added 39 yards on 3 receptions.
He's simply too good to sit.   The Panthers rank # 30 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.   Start Williams.


Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis vs Minnesota Defense

Bettis faced a tough Titan team last week and still rumbled for 73 yards on
21 carries (3.5 ypc)   Kordell Stewart is somewhat of a worry vulturing TDs
but Bettis will get his share.   The Steelers losing OL Marvel Smith for any
amount of time with a knee injury could be a problem.   On the plus side,
the Steelers are for real and they know Bettis is their key.   This week,
they'll face a much softer Viking Defense that ranks # 29 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Seattle Defense

LaDainian Tomlinson was the intended target of an amazing 13 passes last
week.   Even more impressive is that he caught all 13 passes and netted 72
yards receiving.   Paired with 75 yards rushing on 21 carries (3.6  ypc), he
had a very quiet 147 yards of offense.   On the downside, he did fumble and
he failed to get into the endzone.   His involvement in the offense though
is great to see.   He'll face a Seattle defense this week ranked # 28 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 17 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.   They'll also be without suspended CB Shawn Springs.
The Seahawks yielded 181 yards rushing last week against Kansas City.

San Francisco's Garrison Hearst vs Buffalo Defense

Garrison Hearst literally seemed to have turned back the clock last week.
Sunday was the first time I've been able to say ""that truly looks like the
old Hearst"".   His burst and his cutbacks were exceptional.   Throw in the
fact that Kevan Barlow injured his shoulder and I'm liking him even more.
Keep an eye on Terry Jackson and Fred Beasley to see what role the 49ers
give them with Barlow out.   I wouldn't be surprised to see them get some
additional short yardage / goalline chances.   They'll face the Bills
defense that ranks # 22 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Atlanta Defense

You can't bench Marshall Faulk.   Especially against Atlanta's defense
ranked # 24 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
Enough said.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble
stopping the Offense.


Arizona's Michael Pittman vs Oakland Defense

Michael Pittman clocked in last week with another of his middle of the road
performances.   44 yards on 18 carries (2.4 ypc) but he did get the TD
score.   I wish he'd be more productive in the passing game as QB Jake
Plummer needs another option besides David Boston.   This week, he faces an
Oakland defense ranked a surprising # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last 4 weeks.   I caught some grief last week from people who
disagreed with me suggesting Tiki Barber could have a good game against
Oakland.   We know how that turned out.   The Raiders are a very good /
great team.   But people run the ball on them.   They're a little tougher in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs where they rank # 20.


Carolina's Richard Huntley vs New Orleans Defense

Richard Huntley came up small again last week with several stuffs at the
goalline.   He had 19 carries for 55 yards (2.9 ypc) in an ugly game.
Huntley's saving grace may be that Brad Hoover or any of the other Panther
RBs aren't any better.   This week, he'll face a Saints defense that is
pretty soft lately ranked # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.   Still, it's hard to get too excited about a Panther at this point.


Chicago's Anthony Thomas / James Allen vs Detroit Defense

James Allen got the start for the ailing Anthony Thomas and delivered.
Allen rambled for 107 yards on 27 carries (4.0 ypc)   It may have been the
fast track in Minnesota, but Allen looked much quicker than I ever remember
seeing him.   This creates a huge headache for Allen / Thomas owners.
Coach Dick Jauron would never say it, but the Bears obviously have a great
chance to go deep into the playoffs.   They know they need a healthy Anthony
Thomas.   I would think you'd see Jauron very cautious about using Thomas
against a weak Detroit team.   Yes, anything can happen (just ask the
Packers) but I would think you'll see the Bears lean on Allen one more week.
This is pure speculation on my part as it's still very early in the week.
Stay tuned.   Detroit ranks # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last four weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New England's Antowain Smith vs New York Jets Defense

Antowain Smith continues to amaze.   He rolled up 111 yards on 24 carries
(4.6 ypc) last week with a TD.   His longest run was 15 yards so it's not
like he padded those numbers with one huge play.   The Jets rank # 11 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks as they've improved
greatly from early on.   They rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Oakland's Charlie Garner / Zack Crockett vs Arizona Defense

Garner looked like his typical self Sunday slashing for 68 yards on 14
carries (4.9 ypc)   He also caught 3 passes for 38 yards including a TD.
His trouble is that he often has to watch Zack Crockett score the short TD
from the sidelines.   Hard to believe Coach Jon Gruden could be that
insensitive to you Garner owners but that's how it is.   The Cardinals rank
# 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks but for the
year rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Garner is too explosive
to sit for most teams.


Tennessee's Eddie George vs Cleveland Defense

For some reason, the Titans feel the need to throw on every down.   Eddie
George only had 15 carries last week.   He did gain 58 yards (3.9 ypc) but
he needs more work.   The Browns are rejuvenated but they've been run on
lately as they rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Washington's Stephen Davis vs Dallas Defense

Davis left the game last week with back spasms long enough for Ki-Jana
Carter to steal what should have been Davis' TD.   Ouch.   He'd been on fire
before leaving.   Davis returned to the game and looks to be ok for this
week.   Dallas has been sliding down the defense ranking and now comes in at
# 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they still rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Buffalo's Travis Henry vs San Francisco Defense

Just when we were ready to write Travis Henry off, he produces like we'd
been expecting him to do all along.   Against a very good Miami Defense,
Henry rolled for 97 yards on 19 carries (5.1 ypc) and a TD.   New QB Alex
Van Pelt is clearly softening the defense as they now must respect the
passing game.   San Francisco is nothing special on defense ranking # 19 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,
they're # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   They allowed 127 yards to
the Colts last week.


Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Philadelphia Defense

Both Holmes and Richardson are valuable Fantasy players.   Richardson is a
real live featured RB with 120 yards on 20 carries (6.0 ypc)   He threw in
another 70 yards on 3 receptions to boot.   Richardson doesn't get the
yardage but he has a nose for endzone.   He rushed 9 times for 18 yards (2.0
ypc) Sunday and scored again.   The Eagle defense looked very vulnerable
against the Redskin rushing game last week.   They rank # 13 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 14 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.


New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs New England Defense

Curtis Martin's ready to roll after a bye week as the Jets face an
unexpectedly tough matchup with New England.   The Patriots rank # 16 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 19 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.


Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs Kansas City Defense

Staley seems to be running hard but his Eagles are in a funk.   He rushed 15
times for 50 yards (3.3 ypc) and caught 7 passes for 40 yards Sunday.   This
Eagle team is sliding while Kansas City is getting stronger.   The Chiefs
rank # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year though, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so you have to
think Staley might be able to do something.


Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs San Diego Defense

Shaun Alexander had us worried last week as he struggled on the ground with
43 yards on 13 carries (3.3 ypc)   He made up for it on the receptions where
he caught 6 balls for 62 yards and a score.   He's looking more like Ricky
Watters Plus with each game.   The Chargers rank # 23 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank a very
solid # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Last week, they did a good job
against Arizona holding them to 71 rushing yards.


Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs Cincinnati Defense

Both of these guys turned in nice days against St. Louis Monday.   Dunn
rushed 14 times for 60 yards (4.3 ypc) and a score.   Alstott carried the
ball 11 times for 34 yards (3.4 ypc) and 2 scores.   Both were factors in
the passing game as well.   I'd look for something similar against the
Bengals this week.   Cincinnati is falling back to reality and rank # 14 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Alstott is obviously more
attractive in TD only leagues, but I can see going with either of these
players here.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble
for the Offense.


Atlanta's Maurice Smith / Bob Christian vs St. Louis Defense

Maurice Smith injured his ankle last week and turned the reins over to Bob
Christian.   And Christian responded in a huge way.   Dan Reeves is winning
with smoke and mirrors here but I wouldn't be surprised to see Christian
remain a big part of this offense even if Smith can go.   As you saw Monday
night with Mike Alstott, the Rams are certainly vulnerable to a big powerful
RB and Christian fills that bill.   St. Louis ranks # 1 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.   The Rams are beat up though and Christian might be worth a shot if
you're ready to roll the dice.   Just understand the risk though that he
could go back to his old role if Smith is healthy.


Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Tampa Bay Defense

We've said all along that this could be a very good team if they could just
get adequate play from the QBs.   Evidently, that's too much to ask.   With
the passing game quickly fading, Dillon is having a very tough time finding
any room to run.   Dillon managed 63 yards on 20 carries (3.2 ypc) last week
against a good Cleveland team.   The going won't be any easier this week
against Tampa Bay that ranks # 9 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.   You never know which Dillon will show and it's tough to figure out
which Buccaneer team will be there.   That makes this a tough call all the
way around.


Cleveland's James Jackson / Ben Gay vs Tennessee Defense

James Jackson tweaked his foot again so watch to see how this shakes out.
Ben Gay did see action Sunday.   Jackson was a non factor with 40 yards on
18 carries (2.2 ypc)   Fortunately for him, Gay was even worse with 16 yards
on 10 carries (1.6 ypc)   This week, they'll both face a tough Titan team
that's ranked # 4 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the season, they're ranked # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Denver's Mike Anderson / Terrell Davis vs Miami Defense

Mike Anderson answered the critics well with a 33 carry day for 118 yards
(3.6 ypc) Sunday.   He also scored a TD.   With Olandis Gary out for the
season, it's now down to Anderson and Terrell Davis.   Watch this one very
closely as Davis is reportedly making good progress and could play this
week.   If he's ready to go, I think you'll see Mike Shanahan give him
plenty of carries.   Some are even saying he might start.   I personally
think it'll be Anderson starting with Davis seeing a fair amount of action.
Keep an eye on this through the week.   Miami ranks # 10 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs but they were exposed by Buffalo's Travis Henry last week.


Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs Baltimore Defense

I love to see a no name like Dominic Rhodes come in and succeed.   He was
extremely active last week and is doing a great job of filling in for
Edgerrin James.   He rushed 27 times for 104 yards (3.9 ypc) and 2 TDs.   He
also had 6 receptions for 43 yards.   He'll face a tough defense this week
in Baltimore though.   The Ravens rank # 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last 4 weeks and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Even
so, unless you have very solid options, I'd take a hard look at keeping
Rhodes in your lineup.


Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Green Bay Defense

Stacey Mack isn't making anyone forget about Fred Taylor but Mack owners had
to like his 2 TDs last week.   He put up 50 yards on 13 carries (3.8 ypc)
Taylor's status is still up in the air so I'd think you'll probably see Mack
again.   The Packers bring a tough defense ranked # 7 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs so it's going to be rough going for him.   Although it won't be as tough
as it was last week against the Ravens.   On a side note, I keep hearing
whispers that Taylor could be done for the season.   Nothing official from
the Jaguars though.   You truly never know with Fred Taylor.   I could see
him missing the rest of the games and I could also see him stepping in for
week 16 and lighting up the scoreboard.


Miami's Lamar Smith / Travis Minor vs Denver Defense

Once again, Lamar Smith looked tentative and slow.   He only gained 37 yards
on 17 carries (2.2 ypc) although he did score.   Travis Minor, on the other
hand, looked explosive and gained 38 yards on 8 carries (4.8 ypc)   The fact
that Miami won the game probably keeps Smith in the #1 slot but you have to
wonder how Minor would do with a bigger role.   Miami's had to shuffle the
Offensive Line due to injuries, something it did not have to do last season.
Denver is ranked # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks
so this won't be a cakewalk.   They rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major
problems for the Offense.


Dallas' Emmitt Smith / Troy Hambrick vs Washington Defense

It's sad to see but Emmitt Smith is probably not the best RB on the roster
anymore.   Especially not from a Fantasy Football angle.   Troy Hambrick
merely put up 17 yards on 5 carries (3.4 ypc) Sunday but he did score twice.
Smith, on the other hand, managed just 9 yards on 9 carries (you do your own
ypc here...).   Clearly, there are ill feelings between Smith and management
as he's publicly questioning their desire to win as they evaluate talent for
next year.   I'm sure he's a little more sensitive as the primary talent
they seem to be evaluating is the guy who'll take his job.   This week, the
Cowboys face a rejuvenated Redskin team and a tough defense.   They rank # 5
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.


Detroit's James Stewart vs Chicago Defense

James Stewart roared back with a vengeance last Thursday rolling up 102
yards on 14 carries (7.3 ypc)   He looked strong and quick.   Corey
Schlesinger was still in the picture with 5 rushes for 39 yards (7.8 ypc)
and 6 receptions for 41 yards.   Both should have trouble though this week
against an excellent Bears team ranked # 3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.


Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Pittsburgh Defense

Bennett is slowly climbing his way out of the Super Bust spotlight.   (Helps
to have Randy Moss on the field at the same time to deflect some
attention...)   He rushed 12 times for 75 yards (6.2 ypc) and definitely
showed flashes.   He's a threat anytime he touches the ball.   He also
caught a pass.   This week, he faces a very tough defense with Pittsburgh
though.   The Steelers rank # 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so you have to view
this as a tough matchup.



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


That'll do it for the Rushing Matchups.   Passing Matchups to follow.

"WHO IS JACK SCHITT??","I had often wondered, now we know.





----- Original Message ----- 
  WHO IS JACK SCHITT??? The lineage is finally revealed. Many people are at a loss for a response when someone says ""You don't know Jack Schitt!""  Read on and you'll be able to handle the situation intelligently. Jack is the only son of Awe Schitt and O. Schitt.  Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married O. Schitt, a partner of Kneedeep & Schitt, Inc. Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt and the deeply religious couple begat 6 children: Holie Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Giva Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins, Deap Schitt and Dip Schitt.  Against her parents wishes, Deap Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout. After 15 years of marriage, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced.  Noe Schitt later married a Mr. Sherlock, and out of devotion to her children, decided to hyphenate her last name, and became Noe Schitt-Sherlock.  Dip Schitt married a woman named Loda Dung, who became Loda Schitt.  The couple produced a nervous son, Chicken Schitt.  Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt,  inseparable throughout childhood subsequently married the Happens brothers. The local newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens wedding, which was quite an event. The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Hoarse.  Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world.  He returned from his travels with  his Italian bride, Piza Schitt. So, NOW if someone says "" You don't know Jack Schitt"", you can beg to differ. You not only know Jack Schitt, but the entire Schitt list!

News Flash from Hawaii!!!

Snow in Hawaii!

Snow on Mauna Kea - January 23, 2002

Photos by Steven Parente

Throughout last weekend, the Big Island was deluged with heavy rains, high
surf and cool temperatures... reaching the low 60's in Hilo. Brrrrrrr. 

This late winter storm also brought heavy snowfall for Mauna Kea. Mauna Kea
translates into white mountain, and as you view the shots you'll understand
why.  From the ocean floor this is the tallest mountain in the world. 
There was a break today, so I braved the cool Hilo morning temperatures
(low 60's), went to Lili'uokalani Gardens, and took some shots of the
beautiful view of Mauna Kea. Hope you enjoy! - Steve 

Take a look!
http://www.hawaiitropicals.com/picsofhawaii.html

We have some great new selections of potted orchids to look at as well. 
Like the Chieftain"" Wild Warrior Orchid plant Winner of the American Orchid
Society's Award of Merit, this impressive plant with a mild fragrance
similar to the stephanotis flower is NOW AVAILABLE!

The ""Chieftain"" Wild Warrior Orchid plant is a Brassia/Oncidium mix
(P.O.I.-85 Brscdm). Each plant arrives in a 4"" pot and wicker basket. Its
3-inch blooms have a white center and yellow-green petals that are long &
narrow with brown spots.

Hi Eric,
 
It looks like Enron employees have an enterprising spirit according to the H. Chronicle.  Ebay is saturated with Enron goodies.  This is quite amusing.
 
Sorry about tonight and we will miss you on your birthday.  We will celebrate whenever you wish, just let us know.  If you change your mind about tomorrow, email me.  Donnita and Jason are coming over for dinner.  We would love for you to come.  
 
Have a wonderful day.  LU-M

Hi Eric,
 
Sorry but Dad can't make it Thursday night.  Would dinner here on Friday be o.k. with you?  Dad suggested games, etc., and I wanted to bake a birthday cake.  We can either order in or I would love to cook anything you would like.  It's up to you.  Let me know.  
 
Have a great day.
 
Love, Mom

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence.

"","Just returned from seeing ""Black Hawk Down."" Strongly recommend that you see this fact based movie.
 
It is a moving tribute to the skill, dedication, selflessness, honor and commitment of our military. 
 
Any politician in the position of being able to send our military into battle should also see this movie. Hopefully, our current political leaders realize that the military will follow their orders, to the death; and, accordingly,believe those orders should be given only if the national interest of the U.S.A. is in jeopardy.-L

"Re: What's Up","Eric,
 
Thanks for the news on our friends.  It sounds like everyone's getting along pretty well, all things considered.  I saw Enron on NBC Nightly News last night.  Tom Brokaw had a long special on the Congressional inquiry, and they had some footage of people leaving the building.  I also saw a shot of the trading floor on CNN yesterday from last year.  I saw Dick Jenkins, but couldn't see if there was anyone else I knew.  It's amusing to see how the media reports so many half-truths and misleading information.  
 
I got a call from Hector the other day but haven't had a chance to talk to him.  He recently got a job with the Clinton group in NYC, so he's pretty excited about that.  That's great that your brother's wedding is coming up.  Tell him congratulations for me.  Are you the best man?
 
Hope the bidding turns out well.  Happy surfing in the meantime!
 
Brian

"PRESIDENTIAL BUSH'S SPECIAL CHRISTMAS GREETING","Special Greeting


Subject: PRESIDENTIAL BUSH'S SPECIAL CHRISTMAS GREETING


     
      ""Christmas is a time of wonder and joy, of generosity and peace, that brings family and friends together in celebration and song. We sing old hymns and familiar carols, we show love for others in the giving of gifts, and we observe the hallowed traditions that make the season special. This year in the midst of extraordinary times, our Nation has shown the world that though there is great evil, there is a greater good. Americans have given of themselves, sacrificing to help others and showing the spirit of love and sharing that is so much a part of the Christmas season.

      According to the Gospel of Luke, two thousand years ago, the savior of mankind came into the world. Christians believe that Jesus' birth was the incarnation of God on earth, opening the door to new hope and eternal life.    
      At Christmastime, Christians celebrate God's love revealed to the world through Christ. And the message of Jesus is one that all Americans can embrace this holiday season -- to love one another.

      This Christmas we remember those who are without their loved ones. They continue to be in our hearts and prayers. May they experience peace, and may they find hope. And as we again celebrate Christ's birth, may the glorious light of God's goodness and love shine forth from our land.

      Laura joins me in wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. May God's blessings of peace be upon us and upon the world.""

      GEORGE W. BUSH

      Our President understands and 
      believes in the real meaning of Christmas.  
      Feel free to forward his meaningful Christmas 
      greeting to all of your friends and loved ones

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

"Online CFA Program Registration","
If you have not yet had the opportunity to enroll for the 2002 CFA exam, AIMR is pleased to announce that you now can do so electronically through the AIMR Web site at http://www.aimr.org/cfaprogram/index.html.

The next enrollment deadline is 3 December 2001 and, as a reminder, this year AIMR must RECEIVE your enrollment form and payment by the deadline date.

Many CFA candidates have inquired about the status of the New York Society, which had its office in the World Trade Center. We are happy to report that all NYSSA staff escaped safely on 11 September, that the organization is relocating to midtown Manhattan, and that is up and running with a full slate of educational programs. Visit http://www.nyssa.org for information about NYSSA's Fall and Spring continuing education and CFA review courses, and seminars.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

"[Footballguys] Update # 165 11-28 Week 12 Passing Matchups","Hi Folks,

Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  (posted
soon) for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I
always receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton
Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on
Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's
lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in
your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike
Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.
Let's get to it.

Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the
Offense.


Green Bay Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

Start Brett Favre.   It's that simple.   Antonio Freeman continues to look
good and deserves a start in most leagues.   Bill Schroeder was pretty quiet
last week but don't look for that to last.   Jacksonville ranks # 28 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and this should be a
nice matchup for Favre and Company.


Oakland Passing Game vs Arizona Defense

Rich Gannon continues to prove he's one of the better QBs in Football.
With 221 yards and 3 TDs Sunday, he looked totally in control of his
offense.   Of course, it helps when Tim Brown and Jerry Rice are on the
receiving end of your throws.   Both those guys look as good as ever.
Arizona ranks # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks so this is clearly a mismatch.


San Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

That Flutie Magic was fading a little but he looked strong last week with
308 yards and 2 TDs.   TE Freddie Jones and WR Tim Dwight could make it back
this week to pair with Jeff Graham and Curtis Conway.   The Chargers are
getting stronger while the Seahawks were dealt a serious blow Tuesday with
CB Shawn Springs suspended for 4 games due to failing a steroid test.   This
should really open the passing offense.   LaDainian Tomlinson was a huge
factor as well Sunday in the passing game with 13 receptions.   The Seahawks
rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and #
26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble
stopping the Offense.


Buffalo Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

Alex Van Pelt continues to justify my Rob Johnson bashing.   There is no way
Van Pelt should see the bench once Johnson is healthy.   In the ""squeaky
wheel gets the grease"" department, Eric Moulds complained pretty loudly last
week he wasn't seeing enough passes thrown his way.   Van Pelt obliged and
Moulds delivered in a big way including an incredible one handed circus
catch.   FB Larry Centers is seeing tons of passes as well.   San Francisco
is ranked # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks
but their secondary seems to be improving.   For the year, they rank # 20 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Chicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

Jim Miller's 97 yard performance Sunday against the Viking defense probably
didn't carry many teams to victory.   This Bear team is looking more and
more like the 2000 Ravens to me with an adequate QB, powerful rushing, and
great defense.   If Miller is your guy, you may have to accept these up and
down games.   Marty Booker was a non factor after his great week 10
performance.   Dez White saw twice as many passes thrown his way than did
Booker.   Detroit ranks # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
four weeks so that's a positive.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

Tim Couch put up another Couch-like game with 189 yards and 1 TD.   The
ultra reliable Kevin Johnson caught another TD and looks to be an every week
starter.   Quincy Morgan did see more work than usual but KJ is still the
primary guy by a good bit.   The Titans rank # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs so this might be a good spot for him.


Detroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

Even with Mike McMahon providing 4th Quarter excitement, Charlie Batch is
still the starter.   For how long is anyone's guess and you'd have to think
there's even a danger that he could be pulled for McMahon if Batch falters.
Good luck if you can figure out anything the Lion management comes up with.
Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice and he's pretty much it.   Cory
Schlesinger is still seeing plenty of passes thrown his way if you're really
ready to reach.   The Bears rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks but they did shut down the Viking's passing attack last
week.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

Mark Brunell is still hampered by the Quad injury and is no lock to play
this week.   If he can't go, WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell will be
downgraded.   Much has been made of the Jimmy Smith troubles.   Assuming
Brunell can play, I wouldn't be surprised to see Smith blow up with a
monster game.   Just a hunch.   Green Bay isn't anything special on defense
ranking # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
They are tougher for the year ranking # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


New York Jets Passing Game vs New England Defense

Vinny Testeverde should be rested but you have to wonder how he'll fare
against Bill Belichick and New England.   Wayne Chrebet and Laveranues Coles
will be aided by the speedy play of Santana Moss.   Moss is almost a whole
year behind the other rookies though so don't look for too much from him.
New England ranks # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks although Belichick has been known to have a few wrinkles up his
sleeve.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Seattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense

Hasselbeck didn't throw any interceptions Sunday.   But he only threw for
162 yards.   That won't get it done in Holmgren's offense.   Darrell Jackson
and Koren Robinson were pretty active but it was RB Shaun Alexander who
carried the receiving load.   I'd look for that to continue as Seattle
sticks with the conservative game plan.   The Chargers rank # 24 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so it's not like they're
dominating people.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Baltimore Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

Elvis Grbac fought back nicely last week with 259 yards and 1 TD / 1
Interception.   The TD was huge as he rallied the team from behind.   I'm
not a Shannon Sharpe fan but you have to give the guy his due - he moaned
and pointed fingers last week but when the game was on the line, he
delivered.   Travis Taylor and Qadry Ismail are decent plays but
inconsistent.   Indy has struggled lately.   They rank # 14 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 24 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs.


Carolina Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Chris Weinke finally scored a TD.   So what if it was rushing the ball.
The Panthers continued to look bad last week.   Weinke threw for 171 yards,
0 TDs and 2 Interceptions.   Wesley Walls was a non factor which is hard to
understand.   WR Muhsin Muhammad missed last week's game and his return for
this week is still in limbo.   The Saints rank # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
so the matchup isn't awful.   I just have very little faith in the Panthers
right now.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

Peyton Manning is clearly pressing as he tries to carry the load of this
team.   He threw 4 Interceptions last week and three looked to be his fault.
On the flip side, he did throw for 370  yards with a TD so it wasn't all
bad.   This Colt team looks like it could be playing catchup from here on
out so you have to like Manning's chances.   He's battled the trouble with
Interceptions this season and I wouldn't be too worried.   Marvin Harrison
and Terrence Wilkins were the primary targets.   After a couple of excellent
games, TE Marcus Pollard now is catching fewer balls than Ken Dilger.   The
Ravens rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.


Miami Passing Game vs Denver Defense

Jay Fiedler's up and down season continued last week as he threw for 262
yards and 3 TDs leading the Dolphins back to victory.   We've been hyping
rookie WR Chris Chambers since June and he delivered in a big way with 2 big
TDs.   As we head into week 12, it's pretty clear that many of these
""rookies"" aren't really rookies anymore.   Oronde Gadsden was extremely
active as well with 118 yards.   They'll face Denver this week that ranks #
7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

Aaron Brooks continues to look solid.   He threw for 307 yards last week
with a TD plus he ran for 65 yards.   Joe Horn and Willie Jackson gather
most of the passes while TE Boo Williams is not a bad choice if you need a
TE as he's seeing lots of balls thrown his way.   Carolina ranks # 17 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   Although they
rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

Kordell Stewart with 254 yards and 2 passing TDs against the Titans?
Believe it.   Plus another TD rushing.   He's looking good and has the one
thing he desperately needed - confidence.   Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress
both looked strong although Ward is the only one I really trust there.   The
OL is banged up but still I like Stewart's chances.   Minnesota ranks # 15
in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and # 18 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


St. Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Yes, Kurt Warner looked human Monday night.   Even with his ""bad"" game, he
threw for 291 yards and a TD.   He'll be fine, as will all the Rams.   Torry
Holt was huge and Isaac Bruce was a big part of the offense.   Atlanta ranks
# 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but I'd be
hard pressed to have any of the Rams key players on my bench.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

Steve McNair with 37 pass attempts for 334 yards and 2 TDs.   Plus another
rushing TD.   That's how whacked this season is.   He looked pretty good
doing it too.   WRs Derrick Mason and Kevin Dyson with TE Frank Wycheck
handle the receiving.   All are decent options assuming McNair keeps going
to the air so often.   Cleveland ranks # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   However, for the year they rank # 2 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble
for the Offense.


Arizona Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

Jake Plummer put up decent numbers last week with 241 yards, 1 TD and 2
Interceptions.   With Frank Sanders nursing bad hamstrings, it's evident
that WR David Boston is the focus.   And he's been unstoppable.   He had 6
receptions for 121 yards and a TD last week.   The Raiders are ranked # 9 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so this won't be
easy.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Denver Passing Game vs Miami Defense

With Rod Smith hobbled on both ankles now, Brian Griese is looking very
ordinary.   He had 171 yards and 1 TD last week.   Smith has injured his
other ankle.   He clearly was limited last week even though he played
through it.   TEs Desmond Clark and Dwayne Carswell are probably his next
best targets.   Miami hopes to have cornerback Sam Madison back this week
which would be a huge boost.   The Dolphins are ranked # 13 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they're ranked #
14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Kansas City Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

Trent Green didn't throw a TD but he did rack up 256 yards and looked as
good as he has all season.   TE Tony Gonzalez was active as always but most
importantly, WR Derrick Alexander seemed to be healthy.   That's huge.
This week, they face a Philadelphia team that ranks # 8 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   They have 14 sacks over the last 4 games so
they clearly can pressure the passer.   It'll be a great test for Green.


Minnesota Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

Chicago has one of the weakest pass defenses in the league yet they shut
down the Viking passing game last week.   You figure it out.   Culpepper,
Moss and Carter are all too valuable to sit as they could go off at any
time.   But they certainly are frustrating.   My friend (and local Vikings
Expert) Bill Davies has a theory that Moss was serving a secret one game
suspension during the Bears game...  On a positive note, TE Byron
Chamberlain looked to be very much involved in the offense again.   This
week, it's a tough matchup with Pittsburgh that ranks # 11 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   The Steelers are # 2 against
the run so you have to think the Vikings will be throwing.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense

Donovan McNabb looked awful again throwing for only 92 yards.   It seems to
me he's trying to prove his ability to stay in the pocket at any cost.
He's much better when he's mobile.   James Thrash and Todd Pinkston both
struggled with McNabb.   TE Chad Lewis had several passes thrown his way but
couldn't catch any of them.   Kansas City is improving on Defense ranking #
12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank #
4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


San Francisco Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense

Jeff Garcia is a must start in any league.   Same with Terrell Owens.
Owens has a bad foot and ankle but the early word is that he'll play and be
ok.   J.J. Stokes continues to improve.   He scored a TD Sunday.   And TE
Eric Johnson is still very involved in the offense and deserves
consideration in TE leagues.   Buffalo is solid against the pass ranking # 5
in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so it won't be a
cakewalk.   Still though, Garcia and Owens are no brainers.


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Brad Johnson continues to throw more times for fewer yards than anyone I can
remember.   He had 34 passes for 185 yards Monday night.   As always,
Keyshawn Johnson was the WR of choice.   RBs Warrick Dunn and Mike Alstott
each saw 5 receptions as well.   The Bengals are surprisingly tough against
the pass ranking # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   Could this be the week Keyshawn Johnson snares that ever elusive
first TD of the year?...


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major
problems for the Offense.


Atlanta Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense

Chris Chandler refused to play along last week throwing for just 132 yards
and 0 TDs against a soft Carolina defense.   I think he does it just to
spite me...   FB Bob Christian was the leading receiver.   But they're
winning.   Tony Martin and Shawn Jefferson have to be considered risky.
This week, Atlanta faces a much tougher St. Louis defense so that probably
means Chandler will do well.   The Rams rank # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   Overall, I wouldn't put much faith in
this Falcon passing game.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Avoid these guys.   Scott Mitchell or Jon Kitna or Akili Smith?   I think
I'll take Boomer Esiason out of the pressbox...   Peter Warrick injured his
shoulder so keep an eye on him.   No Bengal caught more than 3 passes Sunday
which means they're all pretty worthless at this point.   Tampa Bay ranks #
20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks for what it's
worth.


Dallas Passing Game vs Washington Defense

The Ryan Leaf era is over.   Hope you made video tapes.   Quincy Carter is
set to get the start and I have zero faith in him.   That means Joey
Galloway and Rocket Ismail should struggle as well.   With Emmitt Smith
crying to the press, this team is in danger of total implosion.   Oh yeah,
Washington ranks # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.


New England Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense

Coach Bill Belichick is looking awfully smart starting Tom Brady over Drew
Bledsoe as Brady threw for 4 TDs Sunday.   Clearly, the guy is for real.
Troy Brown is by far his favorite target and the only guy consistent enough
to merit serious consideration in most leagues.   The Jets are tough against
the pass ranking # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.  They rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so it should be
interesting.   Very tough matchup but Brady has shown me though that he's a
guy you'd do well not to underestimate.   If you've been riding him, I'd
look real hard at keeping him in the lineup.


Washington Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Tony Banks won't remind anyone of Joe Montana but he seems to do just enough
to win.   He only threw for 96 yards Sunday but he made few mistakes.   Rod
Gardner and Michael Westbrook continued to play solid football.   Dallas
ranks #  3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so it
doesn't look like a positive matchup.

"Re: Deferred Annuity","Good morning. Yes, I did look at the annuity link. It looks good to me. It
is run by an insurance company. Thus, I assume there will be not only the
standard fees charged by whatever mutual fund in which you invest, but some
charge made by the ins. co. Thus, you should make certain those charges are
reasonable and defined. Additional, if the your money is actually paid by
you to the ins. co.( verses directly to the specific mutual funds) to be
invested, which I suspect is the case, then you must select a financially
strong ins.co. Do not want an Enron fiasco with this type of retirement
investment. Let me know if you have any questions. Love-Dad

"[Footballguys] Breaking News - Shawn Springs Suspended","Entire story:  http://espn.go.com/nfl/columns/misc/1285515.html

Clipped form the Len Pasquarelli article:

Seattle Seahawks cornerback Shawn Springs has been suspended four games for
a violation of the NFL Policy on Anabolic Steroids and Related Substances, a
league spokesman confirmed Tuesday night for ESPN.com.

Springs, 26, will miss this Sunday's home game against San Diego and then
games at Denver (Dec. 9), against Dallas (Dec. 16) and at the New York
Giants (Dec. 23). He will be eligible to return to the eligible roster on
Dec. 24, meaning he could play in the final two games of the season.

The five-year veteran will be docked four game checks, or about $355,555,
based on his 2001 base salary of $1.6 million. During the term of the
suspension, Springs cannot work out at the Seahawks facility or be in
contact with team officials.

Unlike the league's substance abuse policy, commissioner Paul Tagliabue can
suspend a player for his first violation of the steroid guidelines.

A first-round pick in the 1997 draft, and the third player selected overall,
Springs missed the first month of this campaign rehabilitating from a severe
hamstring injury suffered in the preseason. There was speculation Tuesday
night that Springs may have turned to the steroids to help recover from the
hamstring injury.

League confidentiality guidelines prohibit NFL or team officials from
commenting on the suspension in specifics or on the timing of the positive
test. But a source close to Springs said he was ""shocked"" by the suspension.


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


Clearly, good news for QBs and WRs facing the Seahawks soon:   San Diego,
Denver, Dallas, New York Giants, San Diego and Kansas City.   Springs is a
real player and his loss is a big one to the Seattle Defense.

Thanks to Footballguy John Pemberton for pointing me to this one.

Joe

Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman.

Hi Folks,

Doing our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle your
lineups for this final week 17.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups
this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly
where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive
emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but
listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup
may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start
the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup
one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk,
Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.  (Yes, even after
last week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool
in your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.


Baltimore's Terry Allen vs Minnesota Defense

Terry Allen ran hard last week where he rushed 20 times for 74 yards (3.3
ypc) against a tough Buc team.   It'll be much easier this week against the
swiss cheese Vikings ranked # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   Although, these Vikings did shut down Ahman Green last week.
For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Denver's Terrell Davis vs Indianapolis Defense

Terrell Davis looked good again rushing for 89 yards on 18 carries (4.9 ypc)
It's been a tough year and you can bet he'll want to finish strong.   The
Colts rank # 23 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New England's Antowain Smith vs Carolina Defense

A rested Antowain Smith faces the soft Carolina defense that's ranked # 31
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Great matchup.


Pittsburgh's Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala / Jerome Bettis vs Cleveland Defense

Fuamatu-Ma'afala was a workhorse on the ground Sunday but didn't have a lot
to show for it.   He ran 25 times for 55 yards (2.2 ypc)   He did score on a
receiving TD.   He'll face a weak Cleveland defense ranked # 29 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 20
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Washington's Stephen Davis vs Arizona Defense

Stephen Davis looked great rushing for 111 yards on 21 carries (5.3 ypc) and
the score.   He left with a knee tweak but it doesn't look to be serious.
Ki-Jana Carter played great after Davis left.   The Cardinals rank # 21 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong
lately.


Buffalo's Shawn Bryson / Travis Henry / Sammy Morris vs Miami Defense

Bryson ran wild again rushing 28 times for 107 yards (3.8 ypc).   Sammy
Morris spelled him for a few carries and looked good too but it seems Bryson
is clearly the man here.   It's possible Henry could see action so keep an
eye on this one through the week.   The Dolphins have fallen down to # 28 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs Detroit Defense

Emmitt looked very solid again rushing for 126 yards on 26 carries (4.8 ypc)
although he failed to score.   He needs a little over 60 yards to get 1,000
for the season so you can bet he'll be gunning for that.   The Lions rank #
18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 24 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New York Giants' Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Green Bay Defense

Barber saw more action with 16 carries and 71 yards (4.4 ypc) but it was
Dayne who scored with 59 yards on 8 carries (7.4 ypc)   Barber was very
active again in the passing game.   The Packers let Michael Bennett run well
Sunday and have slipped to # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.


New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Oakland Defense

Martin put in another Martin Like day with 115 yards on 19 carries (6.1 ypc)
The Jets may have problems, but Martin isn't one.   He'll face an Oakland
defense ranked # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Oakland's Charlie Garner vs New York Jets Defense

The Raiders don't look nearly as strong as they did.   Garner only had 9
carries Sunday for 23 yards (2.6 ypc)   Tyrone Wheatley only had 5 carries.
This week they've got a nice matchup as they'll face the Jets ranked # 26 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs Kansas City Defense

Alexander didn't do much Sunday rushing 23 times for 59 yards (2.6 ypc)   He
'll be ok though and gets to face a Chief defense ranked # 22 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Atlanta Defense

Start Faulk.   The question will be of course how much he plays but it was
pretty obvious Sunday that Mike Martz lets his guys play.   Trung Canidate
could have really used the work but he warmed the bench while Faulk went
nuts.   I'd say you'll get at least a half, maybe much more out of Faulk and
half of Faulk is worth more than most backs.   The Falcons rank # 24 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 28 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Arizona's Michael Pittman vs Washington Defense

Just when it looked like Michael Pittman was going to take over the clear
cut # 1 RB role, Thomas Jones steps in with 16 carries.   Pittman rushed 12
times for 89 yards (7.4 ypc) which was bolstered by a 39 yarder.   Jones ran
for 69 yards on 16 carries (4.3 ypc)   This was Carolina, though.   This
week will feature a tougher test with Washington ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they've been pretty
soft though and rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Seattle Defense

Priest Holmes ran 27 times for 91 yards (3.4 ypc) plus the score.   Tony
Richardson didn't have a carry.   This week, he'll face the Seahawks ranked
# 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Miami's Lamar Smith / Travis Minor vs Buffalo Defense

This is getting embarrassing.   Smith rushed 7 times for 4 yards (0.6 ypc)
Travis Minor had 33 yards on 9 carries (3.7 ypc)   He's becoming less and
less of a factor with each game.   The Dolphins are in the playoffs but find
themselves playing a different style of ball than they have been.   Minor's
a threat to go long on the screen passes and Smith is a long shot for a
cheap TD.   They'll face the Bills ranked # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last 4 weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Baltimore Defense

We said Bennett just needed carries and he got them Sunday rushing 25 times
for 104 yards (4.2 ypc)   He'll face a Baltimore defense that's numbers don'
t back up it's reputation this week - they rank # 25 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs San Francisco Defense

Even though he didn't score, it was a better performance by Williams who
rushed 17 times for 74 yards (4.4 ypc)   The Saints clearly want him to be
more involved as he was Sunday.   This week, he'll face a 49er defense
ranked # 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 18
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


San Francisco's Garrison Hearst vs New Orleans Defense

Garrison Hearst was a non factor Sunday with just 35 yards on 11 carries
(3.2 ypc)   Kevan Barlow didn't do much either so it wasn't like he lost
time to another player.   This week, he gets the Saints who rank # 15 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs Philadelphia Defense

Tampa's One-Two punch continues to work.   Alstott had 80 yards on 14
carries (5.7 ypc) and Dunn carried the ball 13 times for 47 yards (3.6 ypc)
Alstott's been more effective on the ground but Dunn seems to be more
involved in the passing game.   This week, they'll face an Eagle defense
ranked # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 9
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong
lately.


Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Tennessee Defense

Dillon showed again he can run on any defense.   He had 91 yards on 21
carries (4.3 ypc) against the Steelers.   He'll face the Titans this week
ranked # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks so it won
't get much easier.   They rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Detroit's Lamont Warren / James Stewart vs Dallas Defense

The Detroit RBs were horrible on the ground in this one with Lamont Warren
gaining 19 yards on 6 carries (3.2 ypc).   Cory Schlesinger did catch 11
passes though so maybe he's worth a longshot pick there.   The Cowboys rank
# 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 12 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Green Bay's Ahman Green vs New York Giants Defense

Green was shut down on the ground with just 31 yards on 16 carries (1.9 ypc)
although he did score.   Go figure.   He's still too good to sit in my
opinion.   This week, he'll face the Giants ranked # 10 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 3 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so it's a tough matchup, although I think I'd
start Green unless you really have a solid alternative.


Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs Denver Defense

Again, Dominic Rhodes looked excellent rushing for 83 yards on 20 carries
(4.2 ypc) with a score.   He'll face the Broncos this week ranked # 7 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   The Broncos are definitely
surging after the win in Oakland but I still like Rhodes.


Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Chicago Defense

Mack went off last week with 125 yards on 16 carries (7.8 ypc) and a score.
It'll be tougher this week against Chicago that ranks # 9 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs Tampa Bay Defense

Staley's receiving numbers had been carrying him lately and this week he
paid the price.   He only rushed 8 times for 23 yards (2.9 ypc) and was shut
 down receiving with just 2 receptions for -1 yards.   This week, he'll face
a surging Buc defense ranked # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks and # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Tennessee's Eddie George vs Cincinnati Defense

Eddie George looked the old Eddie Sunday with 130 yards on 26 carries (5.0
ypc)   Plus 2 scores.  This week he'll face a Bengal defense ranked # 11 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong
lately.


Atlanta's Maurice Smith vs St. Louis Defense

Again, Maurice Smith ran poorly but got a cheap TD.   He managed just 38
yards on 15 carries (2.5 ypc).   Bob Christian stole 10 carries where he
gained 33 yards (3.3 ypc)   They're both a gamble against a tough Ram
defense ranked # 3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Carolina's Richard Huntley vs New England Defense

Huntley ran pretty well last week gaining 62 yards on 12 carries (5.2 ypc).
He just didn't get enough carries for this awful Carolina team.   That won't
get any better this week agains the Patriots ranked # 2 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 16 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Jacksonville Defense

Thomas ran 25 times for 76 yards (3.0 ypc) Sunday.   He'll face a tougher
defense in Jacksonville that's been awesome lately ranking # 1 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 8
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Thomas is still probably a starter in
most leagues, but the Jaguars have been extremely stingy of late.


Cleveland's Jamel White vs Pittsburgh Defense

White only had 42 yards on 21 carries (2.0 ypc) but did score twice.   Corey
Dillon showed the Steeler defense wasn't perfect last week.  They're still
tough though ranked # 4 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.





/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


That'll do it for the Rushing Matchups.   Passing Matchups to follow.

Since Mr. Bass didn't follow through on our social engagement, I thought I would do so.  Is anyone interested in lunch?  Is tomorrow too early for you all or should we shoot for next week?  Mr. Hull and I are both available tomorrow.  You guys let me know.  We'll have to go dutch (no more expense report) or one of you UBS people with your big bonuses will have to pick it up!

"The Washington Times National Weekly Edition","Dear Americans,

When I send out a breaking news update from
MillionsofAmericans.com many people write back to me
thanking me for the information and asking me about my
sources. Like Rush Limbaugh, many times, I refer to the 
Washington Times often.

I find The Washington Times National Weekly Edition 
to be well written and right on top of the issues. 
In fact, The Times has repeatedly scooped all other
news sources on major national issues like the Clinton
 scandals. Perhaps more important, The Washington 
Times National Weekly Edition  reports stories the 
liberal news media intentionally ignores because it
does not fit their version of the news.

If you want to stay truly informed and get the facts about
what's really happening in the world, I strongly suggest
that you read The Washington Times National Weekly Edition.
I could not do without The Times to combat the liberalism of
the Washington Post. Now there's a way that you too can have
what I do -- by reading the Washington Times National Weekly
Edition.

If you are interested in reading The Times like Rush and I
do, please go to the link below.

http://database.townhall.com/washtimes/subscribe3995.shtml

<A href = http://database.townhall.com/washtimes/subscribe3995.shtml >AOL Users Click here</A>

This link lets you receive 52 issues of The Washington
Times National Weekly Edition for one year at their best rate avaliable: $39.95.  They've also agreed to send a copy of ""Capital Contacts"", a 250 page spiral bound book with the names, addresses, phone numbers, individual
photos, and email addresses of all of your Congressmen, Senators and Governors.  It's FREE with your paid subscription.

It's a great deal.

There are many good conservative publications, but The
Washington Times National Weekly Edition is great if you want
to be really ""in the loop"", and without a liberal bias.

If you try it, I'm sure you will agree.

For America,

Bruce Eberle

FOR ALL OF US: STAYING YOUNG


1. Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight, and height.
Let the doctor worry about them. That is why you pay him/her.


2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down.


3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening,
whatever. Never let the brain idle. ""An idle mind is the devil's
workshop."" The devil's name is Alzheimer's.


4. Enjoy the simple things. When the children are young, that's all you
can afford. When they're in college, that's all you can afford. After you
retire, that's all you can afford!


5. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath. Laugh so
much that you can be tracked in the store by your distinctive laughter.


6. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person who is
with us our entire life, is ourselves. Be alive while you are alive,
don't put out a mailbox on the highway of death and just wait in
residence for your mail.


7. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it is family, pets,
keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge.


8. Cherish your health. If it's good, preserve it. If it's unstable,
improve it. If it's beyond what you can improve, get help.


9. Don't take guilt trips. Go to the mall, the next county, a foreign
country, but not to guilt country.


10. Tell the people you love that you love them, at every opportunity.


AND ALWAYS REMEMBER Life is not measured by the number of breaths we
take, but by the moments that take our breath away.

                 -From the Internet - Connie & Tom Silliman
                  were the earliest names listed

EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS INFO AND TAKE STEPS TO SHOW DISGUST WITH THE ABSENSE OF THOUGHTFULNESS. MIKE 

FYI 

CNN Headline News did a short news listing regarding Ford and GM's 
(and other major carmakers) contributions to the relief and recovery 
efforts in New York and Washington. The findings are as follows...... 

1. Ford- $1 million to American Red Cross matching employee contributions 
of the same number plus 10 Excursions to NY Fire Dept. The company also 
offered ER response team services and office space to displaced 
government employees. 

2. GM- $1 million to American Red Cross matching employee contributions 
of the same number and a fleet of vans, suv's, and trucks. 

3. Daimler Chrysler- $10 million to support of the children and victims of 
the Sept. 11 attack. 

4. Harley Davidson motorcycles- $1 million and 30 new motorcycles to the 
New York Police Dept. 

5. Volkswagen- Employees and management created a Sept 11 Foundation, 
funded initial with $2 million, for the assistance of the children and 
victims of the WTC. 

6. Hyundai- $300,000 to the American Red Cross. 

7. Audi- Nothing. 

8. BMW- Nothing. 

9. Daewoo- Nothing. 

10. Fiat- Nothing. 

11. Honda- Nothing despite boasting of second best sales month ever in 
August 2001 

12. Isuzu- Nothing. 

13. Mitsubishi- Nothing. 

14. Nissan- Nothing. 

15. Porsche- Nothing. Press release with condolences via the Porsche 
website. 

16. Subaru- Nothing. 

17. Suzuki- Nothing. 

18. Toyota- Nothing despite claims of high sales in July and August 2001. 
Condolences posted on the website 

Whenever the time may be for you to purchase or lease a new vehicle, keep 
this information in mind. You might want to give more consideration to a 
car manufactured by an American-owned and / or American based company. 
Apart from Hyundai and Vo! lkswagen, the foreign car companies contributed 
nothing at all to the citizens of the United States. It's OK for these 
companies 
to take money out of this country, but it is apparently not acceptable to 
return 
some in a time of crisis. I believe we should not forget things like this. 
Say 
thank you in a way that gets their attention. 

Pass it on.

"[Footballguys] Update - Bob Harris on Ricky Williams","Hi Folks,

Getting lots of email on Ricky Williams.   Here's the latest from our friend
Bob Harris of the www.tflreport.com.

//////////////////////////////////////


SAINTS EXPECT WILLIAMS TO START AND PLAY AS USUAL...
Posted Thursday December 20, 2001 @ 23:30 PT


According to reports out of New Orleans, Saints running back Ricky Williams,
who is listed as questionable after coming out of Monday night's loss to the
Rams with a hairline fracture to a rib, practiced without difficulty
Thursday and head coach Jim Haslett expects him to start and play as usual
against the Buccaneers this weekend.

In fact, New Orleans Times-Picayune reporter Jeff Duncan wrote on Thursday,
""Williams was upgraded from questionable to probable and is expected to play
Sunday. He practiced Wednesday and Thursday and will wear a protective wrap
on his ribs Sunday. ...""

Duncan further noted that New Orleans' offense, led by Williams' rushing and
a resurgent Aaron Brooks in the passing game, is overshadowed by the
defense, but the unit is on pace to put together the most prolific season in
club history. The Saints currently rank sixth in the league in total offense
(355.1 yards per game) and are well ahead of pace to set a new single-season
club record for total yardage in a season.

If they can average 338 yards a game in the final three outings, they'll
break the 1979 mark of 5,627 yards.

************* Our View *******************

This is good news but certainly, we're not without concern here.   Their are
really a couple of worries here.  First, you're concerned with re-injury.
He may feel good now but one tough shot and it could be a whole new issue.
Not saying the Bucs are a team that plays dirty, but you can bet a hard
hitter like John Lynch smells blood in the water.   Secondly, you worry
about Deuce McAllister.   He's shown some big play flashes and could steal
time.   Thirdly, you have to be a little concerned with coach Jim Haslett
and the success of the passing game.   Williams has seemed to be taking a
somewhat reduced role of late.   Part of that could be getting into a track
meet with St. Louis Monday night.   All in all, the news is good for
Williams compared to what it was earlier this week.   But he is not without
concerns.   Although to be fair, few players are without concerns at this
point in the season.

Just wanting to pass along what we're hearing.   Thanks Bob.

Joe

on a plane to Notre Dame on Monday when I heard the wonderful news of my
termination.  Oh well, life's a bitch!

No bets for the LSU game, but I feel that LSU should give the Vols. a run
for their money.

Texas finally wised up and gave Major the start...Mack must need to win this
bowl game?

Oh well, have fun at work.  I have to go back to sleep.

He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start.  If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2359&key=1069&""><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness.

Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago.

CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego.

Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2359&key=1041&""><B>Drew Bledsoe</B></A>, QB NE - The Executioners <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2359&key=1171&""><B>Warrick Dunn</B></A>, RB TB - One Man Show <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury.

He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2359&key=1612&""><B>Oronde Gadsden</B></A>, WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play.

He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2359&key=1236&""><B>Jimmy Smith</B></A>, WR JAC - North Blvd Nutwhackers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week.

"","Hey!  Hope you had a good weekend.  I played some golf to get ready for you 
and Bryan.  Amy and I are putting up the tree right now and listening to 
some Christmas music (Neil Diamond rocks).  If you are out in Sugar Land, 
you should stop by Monday night or Tuesday before we play golf.  I don't 
think you've ever seen the house.  It's a good thing Christmas is here.  A 
time of hope.  Something we probably all need around Enron.  Our home number 
is 281-343-8233.  You could even check out the available homes around us.  
Talk to you soon.

Dave

"UBS issues","1) The enforceability of my existing contract with Enron, namely section 16.  What happens to my contract with Enron and will I be forced to repay both my sign on bonus and my retention bonus to Enron?
 
2) Section 1(f) and the last sentence of section 1(c) seem redundant.  Will I get paid the retention bonus absent voluntary termination (i.e. for both with cause and without cause involuntary termination) ?
 
3) Who will be my employer?  And will all stock and stock option grants be in UBS AG stock?
 
4) What happens to the Restricted Stock grant referenced in Section 2 and again in Exhibit I if UBS terminates me with or without cause?  As a follow up,  if the stock is lost then what is the consideration for signing this contract (non - compete)?
 
5) In Section 9(a), the non - compete clause is set up for a 12 month period after my employment begins and continues regardless of termination both voluntarily and involuntarily.  What is to stop UBS from terminating me or anyone else for that matter immediately after signing this agreement?  All they are out is the Retention portion of the contract (since contract is at will).

Dear icruise member,
Cruises, cruises and more cruises, that's all we dream about during February! This is peak booking season and things are off to a spectacular start. The cruise lines are still uncertain of the summer months and that means OPPORTUNITY for you. In essence prices have risen, but not by much...at least not yet. FLASH, the consummate opportunist, begins with a fabulous 4th of July holiday cruise aboard the Carnival Triumph. Just $603 gets you aboard from New York!

Next we offer the unbeatable service of Holland America aboard the Maasdam. All your soft drinks and fancy coffees are FREE, hors' doeuvres before dinner and only $780 from Ft. Lauderdale. We end with the cool winds of Alaska aboard the beautiful Norwegian Wind. Can you believe just $847 and you're aboard for a serene 7day cruise. Of course all FLASH prices include port charges.

He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start.

Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago.

CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=333&key=1871&""><B>Todd Bouman</B></A>, QB MIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury.

Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=333&key=1041&""><B>Drew Bledsoe</B></A>, QB NE - FIBSABs <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=333&key=133297&""><B>
Martin Gramatica</B></A>, K TB - Fear <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=333&key=1171&""><B>Warrick Dunn</B></A>, RB TB - Hunter Shively <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury.

He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=333&key=1612&""><B>Oronde Gadsden</B></A>, WR MIA - Baja <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play.

"","Hey, Eric.  How are things in Houston?  I can't believe everything that's going on at Enron right now.  Who ever would have thought Enron would be appealing to Dynegy to buy them?  I'm sure things are pretty crazy right now.  Are you planning to stay on if this goes through?  Not too much new to report here.  Classes are going well, but they're keeping me busy as usual.  It's starting to get really cold here, so I'm going to miss the Houston winter.  I just got an email from Ashley that he and Lani got engaged a couple of days ago.  I doubt you see them too often, but I thought you'd be interested.  Hope things are going well for you.

"Let the Games Begin! Rockets Tip Off Tomorrow","Dear eric,




 

The Rockets tip off the 2001-2002 regular season tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. against the Atlanta Hawks at Compaq Center. The first 14,000 fans entering Compaq Center will receive a new 2001-2002 Rockets magnetic schedule, courtesy of Miller Lite. In addition, Rockets representatives will distribute small, American Flags to the first 2,000 fans. 

You can purchase your tickets for Tuesday's game at any Ticketmaster outlet, the Compaq Center box office, or by calling 1-800-4NBA-TIX. You may also order tickets online at rockets.com. (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=127374&UID=45456540&MID=182309)

The game will feature a special ceremony including presentation of $86,000 to the Twin Towers Fund, which will go to assist families of uniformed service heroes in New York City. Fans can also show their patriotic support for our nation by putting their signature on a giant 15-foot tall, 50-feet wide banner, presented by 950 KPRC-AM, which will be sent to New York City.

preseason home opener.)

As someone who's purchased Action & Adventure films, you might like to know that the thrilling new screen adaptation of The Count of Monte Cristo <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/883072/ref=count_mon_av3> opens Friday, January 25--and Amazon.com In Theaters has all the showtimes and locations <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JKJ5/ref=count_mon_av4> for your area.

The film follows Edmond, an honest, dashing young sailor who plans to marry the beautiful Mercedes, but who finds his life shattered when his best friend, Fernand, has him unjustly imprisoned and steals Mercedes for himself. Consumed by thoughts of vengeance, Edmond finally escapes and through his new persona--the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo--takes revenge on all who wronged him. Alexandre Dumas's classic story of betrayal is beautifully brought to the screen by director Kevin Reynolds (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves) and stars Jim Caviezel, Guy Pearce, Dagmara Dominczyk, and Richard Harris. The film is rated PG-13.

After much arguing and deliberation, historians this week have come up with a  phrase to describe the Clinton Era. It will be called: SEX BETWEEN THE BUSHES. 
 
The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta announced that Clinton has proven that you can get sex from Aides.  Gennifer Flowers was asked if her relationship with Clinton was anything like Monica Lewinski's. She replied, ""Close, but no cigar.""  The FBI has coined a technical term for the stains found on Monica's dress: ""Presidue.""  
Clinton now recruits interns from only four colleges: Moorhead, Oral Roberts, Ball State and Brigham Young.  Did you know that Clinton had asked to change the Democratic emblem from a donkey to a condom? It represents inflation, halts production, and gives you a false sense of security while you are being screwed.  Arkansas is very proud of Bill Clinton. All these women coming forward ,and not one is his sister! 
Finally, Hillary Clinton recently went to a fortuneteller who intoned, ""Prepare to become widow. Your husband will soon suffer a violent death!""  Hillary took a deep breath and asked, ""Will I be acquitted?""

Read Each One Carefully and Think About It a Second or Two


                   1. I love you not because of who you are, but because of 
who I am when I am with you.


                   2. No man or woman is worth your tears, and the one who 
is, won't make you cry.


                   3. Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want

them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.

                   4. A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and

touches your heart.


                   5. The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right 
beside them knowing you can't have them.


                   6. Never frown, even when you are sad, because you never 
know who is falling in love with your smile.


                   7. To the world you may be one person, but to one person 
you may be the world.


                   8. Don't waste your time on a man/woman, who isn't 
willing to waste their time on you.


                   9. Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before 
meeting the right one, so that when we finally meet the person, we will know

how to be grateful.


                   10. Don't cry because it is over, smile because it 
happened.


                   11. There's always going to be people that hurt you so 
what you have to do is keep on trusting and just be more careful about who 
you trust next time around.


                   12. Make yourself a better person and know who you are 
before you try and know someone else and expect them to know you.


                   13. Don't try so hard, the best things come when you 
least expect them to.


                   REMEMBER: WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS FOR A REASON.


                   True friends: How many people actually have 8 true 
friends?

                   Hardly anyone I know ! But some of us have all right 
friends and good friends!!!

this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

"Computer Gender","A language instructor was explaining to her class that in French, nouns
unlike the English counterparts, are grammatically designated as
masculine or feminine.

""House,"" in French, is feminine -- ""la maison.""
""Pencil,"" in French, is masculine -- ""le crayon.""

One puzzled student asked, ""What gender is computer?""
The teacher did not know, and the word wasn't in her French dictionary.
So for fun she split the class into two groups, appropriately enough, by
gender, and asked them to decide whether computer"" should be a masculine
or feminine noun.

Both groups were required to give four reasons for their recommendation.
The men's group decided that computers should definitely be of the
feminine order (""la computer""), because:
1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic;
2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is
incomprehensible to everyone else;
3. Even the smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for possible
later retrieval; and
4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending
half your pay check on accessories for it.

The women's group, however, concluded that computers should be masculine
(""le computer""), because:
1. In order to do anything with them, you have to turn them on;
2. They have a lot of data but still can't think for themselves;
3. They are supposed to help you solve problems, but half the time they
ARE the problem; and
4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you'd waited a
little longer, you could have gotten a better model.

The Women won.

that Bledsoe lost his job due to an injury, but no one can question Brady's
effectiveness on the football field.  A 258 yard, 4 touchdown performance
keeps Brady entrenched as the Patriots starter.  Keep in mind, the Patriots
have a bye in week 16.

QB - Kordell Stewart - Stewart looked good on Sunday with his second
consecutive multiple touchdown game.  Stewart finished the game with 254
passing yards, 54 rushing yards and 3 total touchdowns.  The schedule looks
good for Stewart down the stretch, especially with games against Detroit and
Cincinnati in weeks 15 and 16.

QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler has found a quality weapon in rookie Chris
Chambers.  Fiedler has been an up and down quarterback this season, but his
upside is good.  A quality schedule throughout the remainder of the season
should allow ample opportunity for solid fantasy stats.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van
Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to
match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against
weaker opponents.  Look for another quality performance against the 49ers
this weekend.

RB - Dominic Rhodes - With Edgerrin James sidelined for the season, Rhodes
has been asked to do a lot in the Colts offense.  He produced on Sunday with
147 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  Two consecutive difficult games against
Baltimore and Miami will slow Rhodes down, but a strong finish to the season
is in store.  With Manning and the passing game throwing interceptions, look
for Coach Mora to run a more conservative offense featuring Rhodes.

RB - Antowain Smith - Smith jumps into the upgrades category once again with
153 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  However, now is the time to trade Smith
away.  His value has hit an all-time high and the remainder of the season
will be difficult with Cleveland, Miami and a bye week remaining.

RB - Ahman Green - Green has struggled the last few weeks, but was able to
bust out on Thanksgiving Day with 150 total yards and 2 scores.  Look for
the Green Bay offense to revolve around Green for the remainder of the
season.  As the winter weather approaches, Favre and the passing game will
become more conservative, which will result in more dump off passes to the
talented Green.  Don't be surprised if Green receives 30+ touches/game the
remainder of the season.

RB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson's statistics have suffered over the
last several weeks with the opposition focusing on the run.  In order to get
the ball in Tomlinson's hands more often, Turner called several short
passing plays to get LT in the open field.  The plan was successful as
Tomlinson caught 13 passes for 72 yards.  The fantasy playoffs look good for
Tomlinson with Oakland, Kansas City and Seattle on the schedule for weeks
14, 15, and 16.

RB - Garrison Hearst - Hearst looked strong again on Sunday with 106 rushing
yards and 2 touchdowns.  In the last 4 games, Hearst has averaged 106
rushing yards/game.  With rookie Kevan Barlow separating his shoulder on
Sunday to go along with an already injured quad, Hearst will continue to see
20+ touches per game and be a quality fantasy option in the fantasy playoffs
as long as he remains healthy.

WR - Derrick Alexander - Good news for Alexander owners...it appears that he
is 100% healthy for the first time this season.

WR - Eric Moulds - Throughout the week, Moulds was complaining about the
lack of balls thrown in his direction and how the team was using him.  Well,
the complaint department contacted management and Moulds got the ball.  What
happened when the ball was thrown to Moulds?  He produced (196 yards and 2
touchdowns).

WR - Chris Chambers - The talented rookie struck once again on Sunday with
101 receiving yards and 2 fabulous touchdowns.  Chambers is the big play
threat in the Miami offense and should continue to see action.  Keep in
mind, Chambers is a boom/bust option at receiver.  He'll dazzle you one week
and disappear the next week.  This guy is going to be special, so grab him
in dynasty leagues.

WR - David Boston - Plain and simple...the man.  A few weeks ago, the knock
on Boston was his lack of touchdown scoring.  Well, 4 touchdowns in 3 weeks
should quiet the critics.

WR - Kevin Johnson - Johnson jumped back in the scoring column on Sunday
with 113 yards and a touchdown.  Johnson is Tim Couch's clear cut #1
receiver and should remain a consistent fantasy threat for the rest of the
season.

WR - Troy Brown - Brown continues to produce quality numbers on a consistent
basis.  With 7 catches for 91 yards and a touchdown on Sunday, Brown
continues to have a quality rapport with QB Tom Brady.  Keep in mind, New
England has a bye in week 16, so Brown will not be available for the
majority of championship games.  Plan accordingly.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downgrades

QB - Trent Green - Green's disappointing season continues.  He looked good
with 256 passing yards and zero interceptions on Sunday.  However, he was
unable to throw any touchdowns and that stat leads to the downgrade.  With
the healthy return of Alexander at wide receiver, Green's stock could be on
the rise in the near future.  Green's value is at its lowest point, so you
could probably get him for relatively cheap.  He's not an every week
starter, but he might have a few big games left for this season.

QB - Donovan McNabb - McNabb has looked horrendous in the pocket over the
last two weeks (221 passing yards and 1 touchdown).  His pride of wanting to
be a quality pocket passer is getting in the way of his production.
McNabb's value will be dependent on his ability to scramble and make some
plays. Right now, McNabb should still be considered a top 10 fantasy
quarterback.  However, if his lack of production continues, his stock will
drop quickly.

QB - Brian Griese - Griese's receiving options are limited, which is
directly affecting his production.  Rod Smith limped through Thursday's game
with an ankle injury.  A healthy return of Smith will boost Griese's stock.
However, Griese needs some quality production from the other receiver
position.  His production is limited, if he is forced to throw to the tight
end position the majority of the time.

QB - Daunte Culpepper - Culpepper did not pass/score a touchdown for the
first time in his two seasons as the starting quarterback for the Vikings.
Another difficult challenge at Pittsburgh is upcoming this week.

RB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas was held out of Sunday's game with a hamstring
injury.  He's expecting to play this weekend against Detroit, but this is
not a guarantee.  With James Allen being effective, it would not surprise me
to see the Bears hold Thomas out for another game to ensure a healthy
hamstring for the stretch run towards the playoffs.  A big game looms in two
weeks against Green Bay and the Bears will need a healthy Thomas in that
game.

RB - Emmitt Smith - Smith was held to 9 yards on 9 carries during the
Thanksgiving Day game.  Until the Cowboys can establish a passing game,
Smith's numbers will remain meager.

RB - Ron Dayne - With Tiki Barber establishing himself as the first option
in the rushing game, Dayne's fantasy value has dropped very low.  Dayne had
26 yards on 6 carries.  Barber had 124 rushing yards on 19 carries, 5
receptions for 41 yards and a touchdown.  Keep Dayne on your bench.

RB - Jason Brookins - Brookins broke his foot in Sunday's game against the
Jaguars.  He is expected to be out for 4-6 weeks.  Drop him and add someone
else to the roster.

RB - Eddie George - George's disappointing season continues with 58 yards on
15 carries this past Sunday.  George is currently tied with Randy Moss for
""Fantasy Disappointment of the Year"".

RB - Maurice Smith - Smith sprained his ankle on Sunday and managed to
return to the game.  However, Smith gained a meager 57 yards on 21 carries
and seemed to be bother by the ankle sprain.  Evaluate his progress later
this week.

WR - Jimmy Smith - Smith tested positive for cocaine in his system after
being pulled over by police.  No legal action will occur, but some sort of
suspension could be handed down by the commissioner's office.  Not a good
sign as we head closer to the fantasy playoffs.

WR - Peter Warrick - Warrick suffered a bruised shoulder against Cleveland
on Sunday. He was held to 1 reception for 22 yards and has not scored a
touchdown since week 4 of the season.  Keep him on your bench until the
Cincinnati passing game reappears.

WR - Randy Moss - Moss was held to 25 yards on 4 catches Sunday night.  Moss
is the most talented receiver in the league, but appears to lose
concentration from time to time.  Keep in mind, his potential for explosive
games is enormous.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Waiver Wire

Keep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12 and 14
team leagues.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van
Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to
match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against
weaker opponents.

RB - James Allen - Allen stepped in for the injured Anthony Thomas and
performed admirably.  With Thomas bothered by a hamstring injury, it's
highly possible that Allen could start against the lowly Detroit Lions this
weekend.  Chicago's defense is strong and the Bears like to grind it out on
the ground.

RB - Travis Minor - With Lamar Smith averaging just 2.3 yds/carry over the
last 6 games, Minor may be given his opportunity to shine very soon.  In his
limited touches, Minor has looked good and could give the Dolphins offense a
much needed spark.

WR - Chris Chambers - This guy is good.  See description in upgrades
section.

TE - Eddie ""Boo"" Williams - I had Williams on the list last week and his
play on Sunday deserves another mention.  Although he had just 2 catches for
44 yards, Williams has explosive potential.  He nearly scored on a 25 yard
pass play, but had the ball ripped out of his hands at the last second.
With Cam Cleeland remaining out with an injury, Williams is a tight end with
quality upside.

        Story With A Moral 

        A boy rode on a donkey and the old man walked.  As they went along they passed some people who remarked it was a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, so they changed positions. 

        Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a shame, he makes that little boy walk.""They then decided they both would walk! 

        Soon they passed some more people who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a decent donkey to ride. So,they both rode the donkey. 


        Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy and man said they were probably right, so they decided to carry the donkey. 

        As they crossed the bridge, they lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river and drowned. 

        The moral of the story? 

        If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss your ass good-bye.

Subject:  Fairy Tales Do Come True

 


In a supermarket, Kurtis the stock boy, was busily working when a new voice came over the asking for a carry out at check register 4.  Kurtis was almost finished, and 
wanted to get some fresh air, and decided to answer the call.  As he approached the check-out stand a 
distant smile caught his eye, the new check out girl was beautiful.  She was an older woman (maybe 
26, and he was only 22) and he fell in love.

Later that day, after his shift was over, he waited by the punch clock to find out her name.  She came into the break room, smiled softly at him and took her card and 
punched out, then left.  He looked at her card, BRENDA.  He walked out only to see her start walking up
the road.

Next day, he waited outside as she left the supermarket, and offered her a ride home.  He looked
harmless enough, and she accepted.  When he dropped her off, he asked if maybe he could see her
again, outside of work.  She simply said it wasn't possible.  He pressed and she explained she had
two children and she couldn't afford a baby-sitter, so he offered to pay for the baby-sitter.
Reluctantly she accepted his offer for a date for the following Saturday.

That Saturday night he arrived at her door only to have her tell him that she was unable to go with
him.  The baby-sitter had called and canceled.  To which Kurtis simply said, ""Well, lets take the
kids with us.""

She tried to explain that taking the children was not an option, but again not taking no for an
answer, he pressed.  Finally Brenda, brought him inside to meet her children.  She had an older
daughter who was just cute a bug, Kurtis thought, then Brenda brought out her son, in a wheelchair,
he was born a paraplegic with down syndrome.  Kurtis asked Brenda, ""I still don't understand why the
kids can't come with us?""  Brenda was amazed.  Most men would run away 
from a woman with two kids, especially if one had disabilities.  Just like her first husband and 
father of her children did.

That evening Kurtis and Brenda loaded up the kids, went to dinner and the movies.  When her son
needed anything Kurtis would take care of him.  When he needed to use the rest room, he picked him
up out of his chair, took him, brought him back.  The kids loved Kurtis.  At the end of the evening,
Brenda knew this was the man she was going to marry and spend the rest of her life with.
A year later, they were married and Kurtis adopted both of her children and since they have added two more
kids.

So what happened to the stock boy and check out girl?
Well, Mr. & Mrs. Kurt Warner, now live in St. Louis, where he is employed by the St. Louis Rams and plays 
quarterback.

"Hey can I bum a Golf Ball","See dear, sometimes you get what you ask for. Love you-L
 
 
 
 

 
A bum, who obviously has seen more than his share of hard
times, approaches a well dressed gentleman on the street.
""Hey, Buddy, can you spare two dollars?""

The well-dressed gentleman responds, ""You are not going to
spend in on liquor are you?""

""No, sir, I don't drink,"" retorts the bum.

""You are not going to throw it away in some crap game, are
 you?"" asks the gentleman.

""No way, I don't gamble,"" answers the bum.

""You wouldn't waste the money at a golf course for greens
fees, would you?"" asks the man.

""Never,"" says the bum, ""I don't play golf.""

The man asks the bum if he would like to come home with him
for a home cooked meal.

The bum accepts eagerly. While they are heading for the
man's house, the bum's curiosity gets the better of him.
""Isn't your wife going to be angry when she sees a guy like me at your table?""

""Probably,"" says the man, ""but it will be worth it. I want  her to see what happens to a guy who doesn't drink, gamble  or play golf.""

"RE: Happy Birthday","Hi Eric 

I told your Mom we would decide on my visit after all the wedding festivities are overwith.  I'm sorry I can't make it to the wedding but I have a few loose ends to clear up since my last day of work here is January 31.  I'll spend time with all of you when I visit.  I'm looking forward to it. 

The weather here is cold and blustery.  We had 14"" of snow on January 6 but most of that is gone now.  We are to get snow showers over night but they only predict around an inch for the morning. 

Hi to Shanna and keep in touch. 

Love  Aunt Bonnie

Hi Aunt Bonnie,
 
It is great to hear from you.  We really missed the fact that your trip was delayed because of 9/11.  Things will be pretty hectic this weekend with Jason's bachelor party and my birthday.  We are going to dinner tomorrow night for my birthday to a restaurant that I have never tried. It should be good.
 
On Saturday, we will be celebrating Jason's bachelor party.  We are going on a casino cruise out of Galveston.  I am looking forward to it.  
 
When do you think that you are going to make it down for a visit?  How is the weather treating you up there?
 
It was nice to hear from you.
 
Love,

Eric

Hi Eric,

"Re: What's Up","Eric,

Thanks for the note, I do appreciate it.   Every thing is pretty hectic 
here, rumors flyin a mile a minute, but just like everything else in the 
military rumors are just rumors until they actually happen, nothin is ever 
set in stone. You will probably know before I do when and if any forces 
deploy unless they are actually successful at the news blackout they are 
requesting for this one.  We'll see.
Hope you and all your friends came through this okay.

I look forward to one day gettin back there to catch a UT game with ya,

Stay in touch wildman.

Brett.

Each week we will highlight a different regional and ask you to submit your vote for the winner of each fantasy matchup in that region. The winners of the first round will advance to the second round, and so on until one lone survivor is left standing on The Road To Rocketsville.

Click here <http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=155487&UID=45456540&MID=204587> now to vote for this week's matchups!

"W-2","Eric,

Your W-2 is correct.

Did you add in your imputed income and subtract the pre-tax?

Gross, less pre-tax, plus imputed = Box 1 taxable income.

Please call if you still have questions.

"IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ALL EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATING IN THE ENRON CORP SAVINGS & ESOP PLANS","
PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

"End of Season","Eric,

Thanks for running the league.  It was fun.  And
thanks for selecting Boumann as your QB in the first
round of the playoffs.  And tell P-Love that I
appreciated him leaving Warner for me at the 7th pick
in the draft.

Anyway, since I no longer work in the Enron building,
it would probably be easiest to drop a check in the
mail:

Reagan Mathews
17210 Canyon Stream Ct.
Houston, TX  77095

By my calculation the amount should be:
$608.5

(1614-840) x 75% = 580.5 + $28 = $608.5.

$28 comes from...my total costs of -132, plus my paid
amount of 120, plus my winnings of 40. 

The reason I bring this up is that it looks like the
""Finances"" page of the website is double counting the
$50 entry fee.  Anyway, let me know if you have a
different number for the distributions.

-Reagan

without writing a word, maybe this could explain:

When you are very busy, but still want to keep in touch, guess what
you do ... you forward jokes.  When you have nothing to say, but
still want to keep contact, you forward jokes.  

When you have something to say, but don't know what, and don't
know how, you forward jokes.  And to let you know that you are
still remembered, you are still important, you are still loved, you
are still cared for, guess what you get?  A forwarded joke.

So my friend, next time if you get a joke, don't think that you've
been sent just another forwarded joke, but that you've been

"[Footballguys] Update # 192 - Updated Players in the News","Just a few more late breaking stories for those that can tweak their 
lineups up until gametime.  Best of luck to everyone that is playing 
for their Championship this week.

***********************************************************

Quarterbacks in the News:

Rob Johnson (Buf) is out this week with a bruised shoulder and ego.  
Alex Van Pelt will again start in his place.

Scott Mitchell (Cin) is doubtful this week.  He is not expected to 
play.  Jon Kitna will start as usual.

Mike McMahon (Det) is still wearing the protective boot and has not 
practiced all week.  He is unlikely to play.  Ty Detmer will start if 
McMahon cannot go. McMahon appears on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore foot.

*** Saturday Morning Update ? Mike McMahon (Det) was downgraded
to doubtful after failing to practice this week.  Ty Detmer is 
expected to start.

Mark Brunell (Jac) practiced on Wednesday and Thursday and is 
expected to start on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as 
probable with a sore quadriceps.

Jay Fiedler (Mia) appears on the Friday injury report as probable 
with a sore elbow.  He is expected to start as usual.

Todd Bouman (Min) practiced, but was not effective and appears much 
worse than his probable status on the injury report.  Spergon Wynn 
practiced both Wednesday and Thursday with the first unit and will 
likely start.

*** Saturday Morning Update ? Spergon Wynn (Min) has been named
the starter.  Todd Bouman will back him up despite his injured thumb.

Dante Culpepper (Min) is out this week and is expected to miss week 
17 as well.

Doug Flutie (SD) is expected to start for the Chargers, but one has 
to think that they will also try and get some looks for rookie Drew 
Brees since they are eliminated from playoff consideration.

Matt Hasselbeck (Sea) appears on the injury report as questionable 
with a sore shoulder, but he is not expected to play.  Trent Dilfer 
will get the start in his place.

Jeff Garcia (SF) practiced on Wednesday and Thursday and is expected 
to start on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as probable with 
sore ribs.

Steve McNair (Ten) practiced on Thursday and is expected to start on 
Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as questionable with a sore 
back, but has been like that for months and is playing great ball.  

*** Saturday Morning Update ? Steve McNair (Ten) was excused to
miss Friday's practice because of a family illness.  He is expected 
to start on Sunday.

***********************************************************

Running Backs in the News:

Bob Christian (Atl) was able to practice on Thursday and is expected 
to play with his sore knee.  He appears on the injury report as 
probable.

Maurice Smith (Atl) was able to practice on Thursday and is expected 
to start with his sore ankle.  Rodney Thomas is also expected to get 
some carries this week.

Jason Brookins (Bal) was able to practice on Thursday, but is not 
expected to play.  He appears on the injury report as questionable 
with a sore foot.  Terry Allen will start and Moe Williams will back 
him up this week.

Shawn Bryson (Buf) will start in place of the injured Travis Henry.  
Travis Henry is out this week with a bad knee.

Lorenzo Neal (Cin) will start at FB despite being banged up with a 
sore shoulder.  

Michael Wiley (Dal) has been unable to practice this week.  If he 
cannot go, Emmitt Smith will also play on third downs.  Troy Hambrick 
would likely play a few more series too so as to not over-work Emmitt 
Smith.

Terrell Davis (Den) will start despite swelling in his knee.  He does 
not appear on this week's injury report.

James Stewart (Det) does not look as if he will play this week.  
Lamont Warren will take his spot in the starting lineup.  Cory 
Schlesinger should also get increased reps.

Cory Schlesinger (Det) missed Wednesday's practice with the flu,
but practiced on Thursday.  He will be the short yardage back this 
week for the Lions.  He does not appear on the injury report.

*** Saturday Morning Update ? Lamont Warren (Det) has been named
the starter this week.  Cory Schlesinger will be used in short 
yardage.  James Stewart is not expected to play.  

Dominic Rhodes (Ind) practiced on Thursday and is expected t start on 
Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as probable with a sore neck.

Fred Taylor (Jac) is not expected to play, but he has practiced on a 
limited basis.  He continues to appear on the injury report as 
questionable with a torn groin muscle.

*** Saturday Morning Update ? Fred Taylor (Jac) is out this week 
after failing to show enough on Friday.  Stacey Mack will get the 
start.

Mike Cloud (KC) can play if needed.  He has a sore hip.

Rob Konrad (Mia) missed Thursday's practice and is not expected
to play on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as doubtful with 
bruised ribs.

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Hi Folks,

Doing our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle your
lineups for the stretch run.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups
this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly
where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive
emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but
listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup
may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start
the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup
one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk,
Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.  (Yes, even after
last week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool
in your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.
http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position
numbers are from ESPN.com.   Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy
Hicks.
Let's get to it.

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the
Offense.


Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Minnesota Defense

Stacey Mack played well last week rushing for 115 yards on 28 carries (4.1
ypc).   He's settling into the starting RB role pretty well.   Still very
quiet on the Fred Taylor front so you have to assume Mack's going to keep
his job.   With no playoff hopes, it probably makes sense not to rush Taylor
back.   Mack will face an ultra soft Viking defense this week ranked # 31 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Indianapolis Defense

Curtis Martin ran hard last week.   He had 78 yards on 24 carries (3.2 ypc)
plus he caught a couple of passes.   This might be his week though as the
Colts are weak on defense ranking # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.   If he's going to explode, this is the week.


St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Carolina Defense

Start Faulk.   End of story.   He's the best player in Fantasy Football.
If it matters (and it doesn't) the Panthers rank # 24 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.   Faulk's knee was described as ""puffy"" after the game but he insists
he'll be fine and play.   Although some are saying Trung Canidate will see
increased time.   He's still a must start in my opinion though.


Tennessee's Eddie George / Skip Hicks vs Oakland Defense

This one hurts.   Eddie George owners have been circling on their calendars
the Oakland game with their porous rush defense.   And then Skip Hicks comes
in last week and looks like Earl Campbell rushing for 142 yards on 17
carries (8.4 ypc) and a score   (Granted, those numbers are padded with a 51
yard rush)   George is such a team player that he reportedly didn't mind
Hicks staying in the game as he had the hot hand.   I think you'll see
George back this week in his regular role but Hicks could get the call at
any time.   The Raiders have improved on defense.   Now they just rank # 30
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble
stopping the Offense.


Atlanta's Maurice Smith / Bob Christian vs Buffalo Defense

Maurice looked a little better (or healthier) this week but he's still
underperforming.   He rushed 11 times for 49 yards (4.5 ypc) Sunday.   Bob
Christian is clearly going to be more involved at RB.   He had 7 rushes for
17 yards (2.4 ypc) and a score.   Christian also tacked on 66 yards
receiving.   At this point, I'd say Christian deserves a look in larger
leagues.   The Bill Defense is pretty weak ranking # 27 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Washington Defense

With 31 carries last week for 173 yards (5.6 ypc), I think it's safe to say
Thomas is back.   He's a perfect fit for this conservative offense.   Plus
the Bear's defense looks like it'll keep them in most games which keeps
Thomas involved.   He'll face a Redskin defense that ranks # 19 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.


Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Cleveland Defense

It's my opinion that Ahman Green owners should just forget about last week.
Green was held to just 9 yards on 9 carries by a surging Tennessee defense.
I see very little to make me think this wasn't an aberration.   This week,
he'll face a softer Brown defense that's ranked # 14 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, Cleveland is
ranked # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Fantasy Football owners
traditionally have memories that last about 7 days.   I personally am not
letting last weeks performance wipe out what has been a great year.


Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs New York Jets Defense

It's too early to be talking about Edgerrin James being a product of the
""system"" but the truth of the matter is that no name Dominic Rhodes is
tearing it up lately.   He's had 298 rushing yards over the last 3 games.
Sunday, he rolled for 177 of them on 29 carries (6.1 ypc)   (and his longest
run was 35 yards so it's not like he padded the stats with a 80 yarder)   He
caught 3 passes to boot.   Clearly, he's playing at a high level right now
and is a must start in most leagues.   The Jets were horrible early on
against the run but have now improved to average ranking # 17 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New England's Antowain Smith vs Miami Defense

You know Antowain Smith had fun against his old team Sunday when he rolled
up 95 yards on 20 carries (4.8 ypc)   He continues to be one of the better
stories of 2001.   Over the last 3 weeks, he ranks as the # 8 RB in Fantasy
points per game.   Smith should have had a TD but went down at the 2.   This
week, he'll face a Dolphin Defense that's been soft lately.   They rank # 26
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New Orleans' Ricky Williams / Deuce McAllister vs Tampa Bay Defense

Williams had a sub par game Monday night and it does seem like Coach Jim
Haslett has been looking the other way the last few games.   He only had 14
carries Monday.   He did gain 57 yards (4.1 ypc) so he did well when he was
in there.   Some of that can be attributed to the Rams and their offense
taking Williams out.   Although you can't ignore Deuce McAllister.
McAllister had 5 catches for 44 yards (but just one carry)   The Bucs are
nothing special lately ranking # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over
the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed
to RBs.   Keep an eye on Tampa's Warren Sapp who missed a good bit of time
last week with a shoulder injury.   It'd be a nice boost if he's less than
100%.


New York Giants' Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Seattle Defense

Barber continues to steal the show from Ron Dayne.   Barber rushed 16 times
for 85 yards (5.3 ypc)   Dayne only had 4 carries for 9 yards.   Barber was
also the Giant's leading receiver with 5 receptions.   I don't see that
changing a lot.   Seattle is ranked # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.


San Francisco's Garrison Hearst vs Philadelphia Defense

Garrison Hearst continues to be one of the best stories in the league.   He
ran for 103 yards on 26 carries Sunday (4.0 ypc)   You have to be a little
worried about him though as Kevan Barlow got both rushing TDs.   And both
Terry Jackson and Fred Beasley saw red zone carries.   Hearst will be a guy
who runs up and down the field but it looks like coach Steve Mariucci has
more faith in the other guys for the goalline.   The Eagles rank # 23 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Arizona's Michael Pittman / Thomas Jones vs Dallas Defense

Things are looking pretty bad for Michael Pittman owners.   As we commented
earlier, the carries allotted to Jones have been creeping up.   Last week,
it looked more like a full blown time share with Pittman running 14 times
for 37 yards (2.6 ypc) and Jones totaling 24 yards on 12 carries (2.0 ypc)
Clearly, neither are any good but that's bad news for Pittman owners.   Of
even more concern is the fact that Jones is looking like the short yardage /
red zone guy.   The Cowboys rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over
the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed
to RBs.   It's tough right now to put much faith in either guy though, even
with the favorable matchup.


Buffalo's Shawn Bryson vs Atlanta Defense

Travis Henry's tough rookie year continued Sunday as he injured his knee.
Shawn Bryson will likely get the bulk of the work this week.   Bryson didn't
do much Sunday running 14 times for 38 yards (2.7 ypc)   He did catch 3
passes.   He'll likely be better with a week of practice with the first
unit.   The Falcons haven't been anything special against the run lately
ranking # 22 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and #
21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs for the year.


Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs Arizona Defense

Emmitt Smith looked like the ""old"" Emmitt Smith.  ""Old"" as in 2001 version
which means not very good.   He struggled to get 39 yards on 12 carries (3.2
ypc) and generally wasn't a factor.   He's an up and down player so realize
your taking a chance with him.   The Cardinals aren't much on defense
ranking # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Miami's Lamar Smith vs New England Defense

Lamar Smith is a grinder type back that needs lots of carries to be
effective.   He only rushed 9 times Sunday for 22 yards (2.4 ypc)   That
won't get it done.   Travis Minor is a threat but it looks to me like the
Dolphins will stay with Smith for now.   New England ranks # 13 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Pittsburgh's Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala / Jerome Bettis / Amos Zereoue vs
Detroit Defense

Amos Zereoue had a pretty good game against Baltimore with 73 yards on 16
carries (4.6 ypc)   But he hurt his shoulder and is now questionable for
this week's game.   Fuamatu-Ma'afala ran hard but had little room to move
gaining 15 yards on 9 carries (1.7 ypc)   And finally, Jerome Bettis is in
the mix although the early word has him as doubtful again for this week's
game.   Obviously, they're being very careful to preserve him for the
playoffs.   We'll try to stay on this story this week for you.   The Lions
are surprisingly tough against the run lately ranking # 11 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Kansas City Defense

Tomlinson struggled a bit last week with just 46 yards on 17 carries (2.7
ypc)   He did add 23 yards on 6 catches.   He'll face an improved KC defense
this week ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs New York Giants Defense

It's been an up and down last couple of weeks for Alexander owners but with
Ricky Watters broken ankle, Alexander is back in the saddle as the # 1 Guy.
Look for him to pick up where he left off.   Last week, he rushed for 27
yards on 7 carries (3.9 ypc) plus a TD.   The Giants have been pretty
average lately in stopping the run ranking # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.


Washington's Stephen Davis vs Chicago Defense

Stephen Davis played well last week with 111 yards on 24 carries (4.6 ypc)
He was one of the few bright spots for Washington.   This week, he faces a
tough but beatable Bear defense that ranks # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble
for the Offense.


Baltimore's Moe Williams / Terry Allen vs Cincinnati Defense

You know it's not good when Obafemi Ayanbadejo leads the team in rushing
yards and Elvis Grbac leads the team in rushing TDs.   But that's what
happened Sunday against the Steelers.  ( I wonder if Ray Lewis thinks the
Steelers have a ""real defense"" yet?)   Moe Williams logged 15 yards on 4
carries (3.8 ypc) and Terry Allen made a less than smashing debut with 3
yards on 3 carries (you do the math)   Tough to say how it'll be split this
week but you'd have to think Allen will see more time.   The Bengals aren't
as good as Pittsburgh, but they're very good ranking # 4 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 4 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Tough matchup especially since it's not yet
clear how the carries will be split.

Cleveland's James Jackson / Jamel White vs Green Bay Defense

Watch this one closely this week as Jackson tweaked his troublesome ankle
again.   He could be ok, but it's not clear early this week.   If he can't
go, I'd expect you'll see Jamel White over Ben Gay as Gay has made more than
his share of mistakes.   Whoever runs will be facing the suddenly vulnerable
Packers who rank # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs San Diego Defense

We had Holmes ranked # 5 last week.  I'm guessing you'll see more sites
follow our lead and raise him up the charts as well.   He had a monster game
(again) with 121 yards on 29 carries (4.2 ypc) plus the score.   He's a must
start against pretty much any defense.   This week, he'll face a San Diego
team ranked # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Still
though, I wouldn't let that stop me.   Do keep an eye on his health this
week as he's nursing a sore groin that might limit him.


Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Jacksonville Defense

Outside of Indianapolis, I don't know that there's been a more disappointing
than Minnesota.   Or one tougher to predict each week.   You get fired up on
Michael Bennett and then he cools off.   Last week, he was back to his early
season workload with only 10 carries.   He did gain 40 yards (4.0 ypc) so
when he ran, he did fine.   With him, it's a numbers game.   Give him enough
carries and eventually he'll break one.   But 10 opportunities won't do it.
And he'll face a very tough Jacksonville defense that's been hot lately.
They rank # 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Oakland's Charlie Garner vs Tennessee Defense

Charlie Garner had his usual productive day with 68 yards rushing on 19
carries (3.6 ypc) plus another 45 yards receiving.   The big news was Tyrone
Wheatley not getting a carry.   Looks like Zack Crockett is back in at the
goalline.   Although that can change at any moment.   The Titans shut down
Ahman Green last week so that's a worry.   They rank # 9 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs San Francisco Defense

Staley continues to salvage his rushing numbers with his contributions in
the passing game.   He rushed 15 times for 36 yards Sunday (2.4 ypc)   He
also had 2 fumbles.   But on the bright side, he caught 8 passes for 73
yards.   They'll find the going a little tougher this week against San
Francisco ranked # 5 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs New Orleans Defense

You'll go crazy trying to figure out which one of these guys will do
anything week to week.   Dunn only had 10 carries for 27 yards (2.7 ypc) and
Alstott only managed 7 rushes for 23 yards (3.3 ypc)   Dunn was heavily
involved in the Tampa Dink and Dunk passing game but that's tough to count
on.   They'll face a New Orleans defense that's likely smarting from the
Rams defeat.   They rank # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major
problems for the Offense.


Carolina's Richard Huntley vs St. Louis Defense

Huntley should be rested after the bye week.   Unfortunately, rest won't
make him any more talented.   The Rams rank # 10 in Rushing Yards Allowed
per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so
this isn't looking good.


Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Baltimore Defense

It's strength against strength this week with Dillon facing the Ravens.   If
you can imagine it, the Bengals will be hurting without Akili Smith at QB...
That means Dillon is the whole offense and you can bet the Ravens will be
geared up for it.   On a forward looking note, it doesn't get any easier for
Dillon as he has Tennessee and Pittsburgh on the horizon.   If your trade
deadline hasn't passed, I'd consider dealing him.   The Ravens rank # 12 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks but I think they're
better than that.   They rank # 3 for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.


Detroit's James Stewart vs Pittsburgh Defense

James Stewart's hip injury may not be as bad as feared.   He had a solid
game in their first victory last week rushing for 91 yards on 20 carries
(4.6 ypc)   The awful news this week is that he's playing Pittsburgh.   The
Steelers are dominating offenses right now ranking # 1 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


That'll do it for the Rushing Matchups.   Passing Matchups to follow.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

type
> your friends FIRST name, type in !000 (that's an exclamation mark followed

"YOU HAVE 48 HOURS - Message from Louise Kitchen","

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

"[Footballguys] Update # 131  Week 7 Upgrade - Downgrade","Hi Folks,

Another wild week in the NFL.   We've got Footballguy Scott Luebke's Week 7
Upgrade - Downgrade - Waiver Wire Picks.

Before we get to that though, let me throw out something I posted today on
our message boards regarding owners who beat themselves up second guessing
themselves.   This season has been as tough to predict as any in recent
memory and I thought this might be something some of you might need to hear.

From our Message Boards www.footballguystalk.com

One of our message board members was (justifiably) frustrated with watching
Trung Canidate blow up on his bench while Ahman Green and Ricky Williams
fared less well as his starters.

My reply to him:

Don't be down on yourself.   That's the nature of the game.   There is no
way you bench Ricky Williams or Ahman Green for Canidate when Canidate was
such a question mark last week.   You did what just about every one of us
would have done I'm guessing.

It's part of the game.   Is it frustrating?   Sure it is.   But it's still
part of the game.   In my local league last week, I took a chance again on
Antonio Freeman after starting him for the first few weeks (but not week 5 -
Aargh... )   Did it play out?   No, it didn't.   I had guys on my bench who
outscored him.   But looking back on everything I knew with Minnesota and
Billy Schroeder, it was the right call for me.

I learned a long time ago the secret to Fantasy Football.   You just have to
take the best info you can assemble, make your call and let the players do
the rest.   Just like a real GM.   You can only do so much.

If you got beat because you didn't know Terry Glenn was out and you started
him, well, that's your bad.   But if you got beat because Trung Canidate
decided to play the game of his life, and proven RBs Williams and Green did
not, well, that's not your fault.

I promise you, if you can predict things to that degree, you need to quit
your job and head to Vegas.

Control what you can control.   Bust your butt to know all you can know.
Make the best decisions you can make and be comfortable you've done all you
can do.   After that, just enjoy the games.   Trust me, you'll be a better
owner because of it.

Ok, let's jump to Scott's report for this week.

Have a great week, everyone.

Joe

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Upgrades


QB - Tom Brady (Waiver Wire) - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks
deserves an upgrade in my book.  More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an
interception this season.  When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots'
coaching staff will have a very difficult decision to make.   There's even
some talk that Bledsoe might not return this season.   Right now, Brady
deserves a pickup by any fantasy team needing a quarterback.

QB - Tim Couch - The yardage numbers won't win any awards, but the 4
touchdowns in the last 2 games is impressive.  Couch is starting to show
signs of becoming a very good quarterback in this league.  Keep in mind, a
tough schedule looms ahead for Couch.  However, with the Browns offense
improving, he should be considered a top quarterback for teams in a keeper
league looking towards the future.

QB - Doug Flutie - The Flutie magic continues to strike.  He's not the best
fantasy quarterback, but numerous fantasy teams can be aided by inserting
Flutie into the lineup.  With Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham staying healthy,
Flutie should be considered a top 15 quarterback this season.  With a strong
rushing game keeping defenses honest, look for Flutie to post numbers
similar to Sunday on occasion.  280 passing yards and 2 scores is
respectable against a tough Denver defense.

RB - Anthony Thomas -The A-Train continues to ride into fantasy starting
lineups.  We've been hyping him for weeks and it appears he'll be named the
official starter in Chicago shortly.  With 188 yards and a touchdown on
Sunday, can the Bears afford to keep him out of the lineup?  I think not.

RB - Trung Canidate - Faulk owners need not worry about using Canidate as a
filler.  232 total yards and 2 touchdowns...WOW!   At the very least he'll
see more action even when Faulk is back.

RB - Jerome Bettis - Bettis has rolled to 4 consecutive 100-yard games.
Look for this trend to continue.  With the Steelers defense playing
excellent and Kordell Stewart limiting turnovers, look for Bettis to have
more good games as the season progresses.

RB - Michael Pittman - We told you to jump off the Thomas Jones bandwagon
and hop on the Pittman express earlier in the season.   With Pittman seeing
80% of the carries and more importantly producing, all looks good for
Pittman owners.  I've never been an advocate of starting Cardinals' running
backs though.  After his 137 total yards and a touchdown performance, now
may be the time to deal Pittman.

RB - Jason Brookins (Waiver Wire) - Terry Allen's ankle sprain may be all
Brookins needs to become the team's starting running back.  He's looked good
running behind a pretty solid offensive line, but his carries have been
limited due to Allen's presence.  Keep in mind, the Ravens are contacting
other teams about trading for another back prior to the trade deadline.
Right now, Brookins is a solid waiver wire choice.

WR - David Patten (Waiver Wire) - Anyone who rushes, passes and receives for
a touchdown in the same game deserves an upgrade.  With Terry Glenn being
bothered by a hamstring injury, Patten made the most of his opportunity.  He
has looked good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make
plays, which is needed in the Patriots offense.  Grab him, if you are in
need of a receiver.

WR - David Terrell (Waiver Wire) - Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday
with 7 catches for 91 yards.  More importantly for his fantasy value, Marcus
Robinson suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season.  The
Robinson injury makes way for Terrell to enter the Bears' starting lineup.
If you're in need of a receiver, Terrell is the best option in the free
agent market, if he is still available.

WR - Keyshawn Johnson - Johnson has yet to score a touchdown this season,
but he is doing everything else.  Johnson is averaging 8 catches/game and
appears unstoppable at times.  However, he did suffer a hip flexor injury
late in the game and appears questionable for this week's game.

WR - Johnnie Morton - Morton continues to impress this season.  He has
surpassed the 100-yard mark 3 times this season and scored 3 touchdowns.
With Germane Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season, Morton becomes the
team's #1 wide receiver.  Morton owners should be happy.

WR - David Boston - Plain and simple, Boston is bigger, faster and better
than any defensive back on the field.  In his first 5 games, Boston is
averaging 96 receiving yards/game.  Keep him in your lineup every week.

WR - Jeff Graham - With the San Diego running game and LaDainian Tomlinson
garnering a lot of attention, the receiving corps is able to see plenty of
open spaces downfield.  Graham scored his first two touchdowns of the season
and gained 107 yards on Sunday.  With defenses focusing on Tomlinson, look
for Flutie to find Graham for 5-6 more touchdown passes this season.

WR - Rod Gardner (Waiver Wire) - While Michael Westbrook appears invisible,
Gardner is impressing on the other side of the field.  208 yards and a
touchdown (with another score called back), Gardner is starting to claim the
title of ""best rookie receiver"".  Grab him, if he is available in your
league.  Gardner is the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game.

TE - Bubba Franks - Franks has been diagnosed with Cris Carter disease
because ""All he does is catch touchdowns"".  6 touchdowns in 6 games.  If
only he can start picking up yardage points.

TE - Cam Cleeland - Cleeland scored another touchdown on Sunday to increase
the total to 4 scores this season.  With Aaron Brooks struggling to find his
wide receivers in the red zone, Cleeland's value should remain high for a
little while longer.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downgrades


QB - Aaron Brooks - Brooks has been struggling trying to find his receivers,
especially in the red zone.  With just 4 touchdowns in his last 4 games,
Brooks is in a minor slump.  There's no need to jump off his bandwagon.  On
the flip side, an upturn in production is possible over the next 4 weeks as
New Orleans faces: St. Louis, NY Jets, San Francisco and Indianapolis.  But
for now, we're a little worried and Brooks needs to be downgraded with our
fingers crossed to see him upgraded starting next week.

QB - Elvis Grbac - Two injuries in two weeks have Grbac downgraded once
again this week.  Without a consistent running game, look for Grbac's
struggles to continue.  For now, Grbac is expected to be listed as
questionable for this week's game against Jacksonville.

QB - Charlie Batch - With 338 yards and 3 touchdowns, many would think that
Batch deserves an upgrade.  Well, if the box scores were the only thing
studied, this would be the case.  However, the season ending injury to
Batch's #1 receiving option, Germane Crowell, gives Batch a downgrade in my
book.  With both Crowell and Herman Moore out for the season, Batch must
rely on Johnnie Morton and Larry Foster as his starting receivers...not a
good sign.

QB - Vinny Testaverde - Testaverde was unable to get anything going against
the Rams on Sunday.  With the Rams leading by a significant margin,
Testaverde was benched in order to get Chad Pennington some playing time.
All in all, not a good sign for Testaverde owners.  Testaverde's yardage
numbers are poor this season.  However, he has thrown for multiple
touchdowns in 3 of his 6 games this season.

RB - Warrick Dunn - Dunn suffered a hamstring strain on Sunday against the
Steelers.  Look for Dunn to be listed as questionable on the injury report
this week.  With the Vikings mediocre defense coming to town, Dunn's owners
can't be very happy with this recent turn of events.  Joe's email updates
will keep you posted on the latest Dunn news.

RB - Michael Bennett - Chapman was able to rush for 90 yards on 22 carries
during Sunday's game versus Green Bay.  This is bad news for the
unproductive, injured Bennett.  With Bennett failing to clear the 60-yard
mark this season, his starting job is in jeopardy.  Keep an eye on this
situation.

RB - James Stewart - Stewart suffered an ankle sprain in Sunday's loss to
the Titans.  He was limited to 17 yards on 9 carries before leaving the
game.  Expect him to be listed as questionable for this week's game.  As
more of a straight ahead runner, Stewart may be able to play on the injury
and be somewhat effective.  With this week's game on astroturf, the Lions
may decide to rest Stewart and get him back to 100% health.  Regardless, any
kind of injury to an often injured player deserves a downgrade.

RB - Tim Biakabatuka - Biakabatuka suffered a broken foot and is lost for
the season.

RB - Terry Allen - Allen was limited to 12 yards on 3 carries after
suffering an ankle injury on Sunday.  Backup Jason Brookins replaced Allen
and looked decent.  If Allen misses any action, Brookins may replace him as
the team's starter with one good performance.  The Ravens are exploring
trade options for another running back prior to the trade deadline, so the
Ravens RB situation is cloudy at the current time.

RB - James Allen - We've been hyping Anthony Thomas for weeks and it appears
he will soon be named the official starting RB in Chicago.  Plain and
simple, Allen has been horrible this season.  With Thomas gaining 188 yards
on 22 carries, Allen will be relegated to spot duty.

RB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson was limited to 58 yards on 25 carries
and 0 touchdowns against a stingy Broncos defense.  It was bound to happen
that a team would shut down Tomlinson.  Tomlinson owners should be happy
that he received 25 carries despite being ineffective.  Just a slight
downgrade to show he's human.  Keep him in your lineup.

WR - Marcus Robinson - Robinson suffered a torn ACL and MCL and is lost for
the season.

WR - Germane Crowell - Crowell suffered a torn patella tendon and is lost
for the season.

WR - Terry Glenn - Currently, Glenn is suffering from a hamstring strain
that he suffered in last week's practice.  He missed Sunday's game and
witnessed the ""David Patten Show"".  With Patten showcasing his playmaking
skills, look for Glenn's touches to be reduced when he returns from injury.
Previously, Glenn was considered the only playmaker on the Patriots offense.
Glenn can post dazzling numbers, but his inconsistency has hurt fantasy
owners in the past and this should once again be the case this season.

WR - Darney Scott - Scott's role in the Bengals' offense has seemingly been
reduced in the last few weeks.  After suffering a rib injury that forced
Scott out of Sunday's game, Kitna started finding Peter Warrick on a
consistent basis.  With Kitna starting to build a rapport with the talented
2nd year wideout from Florida St., Scott now appears to be the team's second
option in the passing game.

WR - Marvin Minnis - Minnis has been non existent in the Chiefs offense
since week 1.  With Sylvester Morris out for the season, Minnis looked ready
to take over the role and produce quality numbers.  With Trent Green
struggling at quarterback, Minnis' fantasy impact has been minimal at best.
If Minnis is a starter on your roster, your receiving corps needs some
serious help.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Waiver Wire


QB - Tom Brady - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks deserves an upgrade
in my book.  More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an interception this
season.  When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots' coaching staff will
have a very difficult decision to make.  Right now, Brady deserves a pickup
by any fantasy team needing a quarterback.

RB - Richard Huntley - Huntley has been named the team's starter after the
season ending foot injury to Tim Biakabatuka.  It was only a matter of time
before Biakabatuka would get injured or benched again.  With the Panthers
facing the Jets pitiful run defense this week, Huntley should pay instant
dividends.

RB - Doug Chapman - Chapman was able to rush for 90 yards on 22 carries in
replacement of the injured Michael Bennett.  With the unproductive Bennett
suffering from an ankle injury, Chapman will be given the chance to earn the
team's starting running back job.  Grab him, if he is available.

RB - Jason Brookins - Terry Allen's ankle sprain may be all Brookins needs
to become the team's starting running back.  He's looked good running behind
a quality offensive line, but his carries have been limited due to Allen's
presence.  Keep in mind, the Ravens are contacting other teams about trading
for another back prior to the trade deadline.  Right now, Brookins is a
solid waiver wire choice.

WR - David Patten - Anyone who rushes, passes and receives for a touchdown
in the same game deserves an upgrade.  With Terry Glenn being bothered by a
hamstring injury, Patten made the most of his opportunity.  He has looked
good over the last few weeks and has shown the ability to make plays, which
is needed in the Patriots offense.  Grab him, if you are in need of a
receiver.

WR - David Terrell - Terrell had a breakout game on Sunday with 7 catches
for 91 yards.  More importantly for his fantasy value, Marcus Robinson
suffered a serious knee injury and is lost for the season.  The Robinson
injury makes way for Terrell to enter the Bears' starting lineup.  If you're
in need of a receiver, Terrell is the best option in the free agent market,
if he is still available.

WR - Rod Gardner - While Michael Westbrook appears invisible, Gardner is
impressing on the other side of the field.  208 yards and a touchdown (with
another score called back), Gardner is starting to claim the title of ""best
rookie receiver"".  Grab him, if he is available in your league.  Gardner is
the lone bright spot in the Redskins passing game.

WR - Larry Foster - With Herman Moore and Germaine Crowell out for the
season, the Lions will insert Larry Foster into the lineup.  Foster is a
talented receiver out of LSU with playmaking skills.  If you are in a deep
league and in need of receiver help, give Foster a shot on your team.

McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness.

Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago.

CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego.

Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2281&key=1041&""><B>Drew Bledsoe</B></A>, QB NE - FIBSABs <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2281&key=133297&"">

Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2281&key=1171&""><B>Warrick Dunn</B></A>, RB TB - Hunter Shively <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury.

"[Footballguys] Update - Bettis Considering Sitting Last Two Regular Games","Entire story:
http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/sports/steelerslive/s_9838.ht
ml


From the Jerry DiPaola article:   Steelers running back Jerome Bettis missed
practice Wednesday, and later said he might not need to play in the final
two regular-season games to be ready for the first playoff game Jan. 19 or
20.

Bettis has missed the past three games with a serious groin injury that he
described to David Letterman last week as ""like splitting your pants, but
you're splitting your body.""

""Do you need to (play)? Need is a strong word,"" Bettis said yesterday after
watching his teammates practice. ""Would you like to get a little work in?
Just a little bit, nothing strenuous. But you would like to get a little
work in if you could.

""But if you can't, I don't think it precludes you from playing (in the
playoffs).""

Bettis said that he didn't know if he would practice today or play Sunday in
Cincinnati, but he will base his availability on how he feels.

""You want to take care of the injury first and if that means not playing,
that means not playing,"" he said. ""But you want to make sure you're healed
up. The team playing as well as it has played allows me the opportunity to
get healthy. I'm using it very, very wisely.

""What I do know is if you don't play, there is going to be a certain amount
of rust associated with not having played. The key is to minimize the rust.
This is nine years in. I'm not going to miss much.""

************  Our View  ****************

Pretty much sums it up right there.   Clearly, Bettis is a large risk here.
Stay tuned to see how he progresses but even if he were to start, there's
always that very real risk that he'd pull himself out if he felt a twinge.

Thanks to Footballguy Greg Lizotte for pointing me to this one.

Joe

OK, here's the deal.  I've heard from everyone and we're good for tomorrow!  Now - where and when? I park in Allen Center and can carry 3 people.  Who else can drive?  I'm available anytime - like 11:30 or so.

Since Mr. Bass didn't follow through on our social engagement, I thought I would do so.  Is anyone interested in lunch?  Is tomorrow too early for you all or should we shoot for next week?  Mr. Hull and I are both available tomorrow.  You guys let me know.  We'll have to go dutch (no more expense report) or one of you UBS people with your big bonuses will have to pick it up!

Let me know.

"[Footballguys] Update - Bob Harris on Stephen Davis","Hi Folks,

Here's the lates from our friend Bob Harris of the www.tflreport.com on
Washington RB Stephen Davis.

Joe

/////////////////////////////////////


SKINS WILL ASK DAVIS TO PULL THE LOAD AGAINST CHICAGO...
Posted Friday December 21, 2001 @ 03:55 PT


Washington running back Stephen Davis has been remarkably durable this
season. He heads into his 14th game of the season and hasn't missed a game
so far, the first time in the past two seasons he has been able to do that.
However, Davis -- listed as questionable this week with a bruised knee -- is
clearly showing signs of wearing down after hauling the rock 275 times this
season.

Davis, who sat out Wednesday's workout all together, only took part in
portions of Thursday's practice. Nonetheless, head coach Marty
Schottenheimer told reporters he expects the tailback to practice fully
Friday before starting and playing as usual against the Bears this Sunday.

Of course, no one can be sure how his knee will hold up against one of the
more punishing defenses in the league.

That could be a problem because Ki-Jana Carter is still bothered by a sore
shoulder. Carter has had just six carries in the past three games. The team
will need to get more out of him this week because Davis is likely to need
more rest than usual. ...

Whatever the case might be, the Redskins desperately need Davis to carry the
load. So far this season the Redskins are 3-1 when he gains 100 yards. Given
the fact that quarterback Tony Banks has tailed off the last couple weeks,
Washington is geared towards running 40 times against Chicago.

""It's going to be physical,"" Davis said yesterday. ""We've got to go do what
we do best: Control the clock [and] keep their offense off the field.""

The Redskins have been doing what they do best especially well the past two
weeks with Davis, whose 1,116 yards rank third in the NFL, racking up 110
yards at Arizona on Dec. 9 and 111 yards against the Eagles last weekend.

Washington ranks a solid 10th in the NFL in rushing offense (115.8 yards),
and that figure would be even higher if the club hadn't struggled so badly
during an 0-5 start. The Redskins have averaged 135.9 rushing yards over the
past nine games; for the season, only one team averages more (Pittsburgh,
174.2).

The Bears, on the other hand, have held opponents to less than 100 yards on
the ground eight times this season, including Tampa Bay last weekend (61
yards on 18 carries). And Chicago has only allowed two running plays of 20
yards or more this season (Davis has six such runs this season).

""My thing is, we've got to go in there and see what's going to work,"" Davis
said. ""We'll run some plays, see what works against them and just play
hard.""

It's worth noting that two of Chicago's last four opponents have topped the
100-yard mark, including Green Bay two weeks ago. That day the Packers
rushed for 167 yards in a 17-7 victory.

The Redskins believe they could have similar success. They don't want to
belittle the Bears' ranking or reputation, but they're ready to test the
Bears primary strength

""Our identity is to run the ball,"" tight end Walter Rasby said. ""We're a
running offense. We take pride in what we do best. It's not anything about
the Bears are coming to town, saying this or saying this. We do what we do.
They do what they do. It's going to be a good, physical football game up
front.""


*************  Our View  *************

The only thing that I'd add to this would be the Bears have not played as
well on rush defense lately as they had earlier in the season.   They did
hold Tampa Bay down last week and they did limit Detroit to 67 yards rushing
in week 12.  But they also gave up 124 yards rushing to Minnesota and a
whopping 167 yards rushing to Green Bay two weeks ago.   They are very good
but in my opinion, they're not in the ""shut down"" category of rushing
defenses like Pittsburgh is this year or Baltimore was last year.   In fact,
over the last 4 weeks, they rank # 16 in the league.   I think they're
better than that but clearly some teams have recently had success against
them.

We'll know more after Friday's practice but wanted to shoot this to you now.
Also, don't understimate the impact of Ki-Jana Carter's injury.   Without a
solid alternative, Davis may be asked to do more than he would if Carter was
100%.

"Hi!","Hello!

I apologize for the mass email. How is everyone doing? I hope everyone's family and friends are doing fine. In light of recent events, I thought about all of you. My family is doing fine. Apparently one of my ex-roommates, Indian guy, was apparently beaten for ""looking"" middle-eastern in San Francisco. Unbelievable. So what's up? School is going quite well for me. I'm enjoying classes. The people here are outgoing, which is somewhat surprising since we're all a bunch of math freaks. Pittsburgh is no Houston, but it's bearable for a year. I am a bit concerned with the job market this year. 

Michael and Sheila, any plans yet? My best friend and his girlfriend are finally getting married this October, after 7 arduous years. You got time, obviously. I had no luck with Gulay. But I think it was unreasonable to expect anything. I enjoyed it, though. Lenine, how are things? Have you seen ""The Tao of Steve"" yet? How is your brother doing (these days). Eric, ready to join the special-forces? I believe they're looking for people... How is Shanna doing? Are you the head of the Texas desk by now? 

Drop me a line when y'all get a chance. Take care,

-Hector

"[Footballguys] Update # 181  Week 15 Passing Matchups","Hi Folks,

Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for
exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always
receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton
Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on
Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's
lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in
your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike
Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.
Let's get to it.

Joe


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the
Offense.


Buffalo Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Alex Van Pelt threw for 219 yards and 0 TDs with 1 Interception last week.
He threw a ton of balls toward Eric Moulds although not many were caught.
Peerless Price is also still a prime target.   TE Jay Reimersma and RB Larry
Centers will see plenty of short throws.   The Falcons rank # 30 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs so they've pretty much been weak all year defending the pass.


Dallas Passing Game vs Arizona Defense

It'll be hard to imagine Quincy Carter leading many FF teams to Playoff
victories this week.   If you've got to go with one, Joey Galloway suddenly
become Carter's favorite target last week.  Go figure.   Just when you
thought he was locking on Rocket Ismail.   Both guys are risks.   Even with
Arizona ranked # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Great matchup, but I just don't have
a lot of faith in these guys being able to take advantage of it.


Oakland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

Yes, Brett Favre and the Packers didn't do much against the Titans last
week.   But in my opinion, you just can't bench Rich Gannon, Jerry Rice or
Tim Brown.   They're just too good and are too liable to explode at any
time.   The Titans rank # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
four weeks so clearly, people are throwing on them.   For the year, they
rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.   Start your Raiders.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

Hard to imagine but Kordell Stewart is carrying Fantasy Teams right now.
He's been awesome and isn't showing any signs that I can see of letting up.
The one factor he'd been missing, he now seems to have in abundance -
Confidence.   Hines Ward wasn't a big factor receiving but he's a great bet.
Plaxico Burress made the circus catch and looks to be quickly rising in the
charts.   The Lions are fired up but still rank # 20 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


St. Louis Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

Start your Rams.   Warner, Bruce and Holt are sure starters.   Yes, it's
tough to guess which Ram WR will do well as Warner spreads the ball around.
But I don't see how you can have either of these guys benched as you could
leave a ton of points on the table.   Carolina ranks # 23 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble
stopping the Offense.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

Tim Couch evidently had been catching a lot of flak from Browns fans for not
being a very accurate passer last week.   Seeing as how not one of the
20,000 bottles thrown on the field actually hit a player or ref, I'd guess
the fans might want to keep their day jobs...   Couch wasn't very effective
last week with 184 yards, 0 TDs and 1 Interception.   Normally reliable WR
Kevin Johnson came up small as well.   I still have faith in Johnson as he's
shown too much this year to discount him over one game.   The Packers rank #
22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Kansas City Passing Game vs San Diego Defense

Trent Green's finally coming around.   Either that, or he's just teasing
us...   With the dominant running of Priest Holmes, Green is finding room to
throw.   Marvin Minnis and Derrick Alexander are doing well.   Tony Gonzalez
isn't as involved as his owners would like but he's a sure starter in TE
leagues.   The Chargers rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Minnesota Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

The hits just keep rolling for Minnesota.   QB Todd Bouman's thumb is
causing serious worry.   Enough that there's talk that Spergon Wynn could
get the start.   Stay tuned on this one.   Randy Moss has clearly decided to
play lately and will wind up with season long stats that'll make all the non
Moss owners wonder what all the Moss guys were complaining about early on.
Cris Carter is definitely taking a backseat to Moss lately.   The Jaguars
rank # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Jets Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

The Jets are tough to call lately.   Testeverde threw for 196 yards and did
manage 2 TDs.   But Laveranues Coles didn't do a lot.   (Although Chris
Berman's call of ""Laveranues Coles 'shopping' for 18 yards"" was classic on
the Prime Time highlights...)   Wayne Chrebet was more active and of course
Anthony Becht caught the TD but not much else.   All in all, a risky place
for FF passing game material.   Curtis Martin should run wild on this bunch.
The Colts rank # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

The passing game lately has been Donovan McNabb throwing to Duce Staley.
That's ok as long as they get the yards.   Todd Pinkston and James Thrash
have been inconsistent.   They'll face a 49er team that's been pretty soft
lately ranking # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

I never thought I'd be writing about the pass happy Titans but that's the
case.   Steve McNair has been awesome lately and ranks as the # 2 QB in the
league over the last 3 games.   Derrick Mason and Kevin Dyson are starters
in just about every league.   TE Frank Wycheck is producing like always.
The Raiders rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Atlanta Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense

It's tough to depend on Chris Chandler but last week he played very well
throwing for 249 yards and 2 TDs.   Tony Martin seems to be coming on a bit.
We said we loved Brian Finneran and he scored.   He's not on the field
enough (yet) to be a solid starter but he makes things happen out there.
RB Bob Christian is an integral part of the passing game as well.   This
week, they'll face a Buffalo defense ranked # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Baltimore Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Elvis Grbac managed 2 TDs with just 159 yards Sunday night.   Picking a
receiver for the Ravens is as tough as ever with Ismail / Stokely / Taylor
all in the mix.   TE Shannon Sharpe is the sure bet.   This week, they'll
face the Bengals ranked # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Terry Allen should be more of a
factor in this one as well.


Green Bay Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

I can't imagine benching Brett Favre right now.   He seems to get better as
it gets colder and they have a lot riding on these next few games after
losing to Tennessee Sunday.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder both
should be ready to play.   The Browns have been tough lately ranking # 8 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

Mark Brunell posted 202 yards , 1 TD and 2 Interceptions Sunday.   Keenan
McCardell and Jimmy Smith were as active as usual.   They're two of the
steadiest guys in the league.   It's surprising, but Minnesota's been tough
lately against the pass ranking # 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Miami Passing Game vs New England Defense

The problem with Jay Fiedler is that when he's ugly, he's really ugly.   If
you started him Sunday, you know what I mean.   149 yards, 0 TDs and 3
Interceptions wont win Real or Fantasy Games for anyone.   Oronde Gadsden
was injured to boot.   Gasden said he'll be ready Sunday.   Chris Chambers
still has tons of upside if you're ready to roll the dice.   New England
ranks # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


San Diego Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense

Doug Flutie threw 3 Interceptions Sunday with 0 TDs.   Another day like that
and he'll see Drew Brees finishing the game.   You might see Brees anyway as
they'll want to start taking a look at their QB of the future.   Jeff Graham
and Curtis Conway continue to play well.  Tim Dwight could miss another game
due to his lung problem.   TE Freddie Jones is inconsistent but if you own
him, he's probably a starter for you.   Kansas City ranks # 16 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Seattle Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense

With 152 yards, 0 Interceptions and 0 TDs, you can say at least Hasselbeck
didn't do anything to hurt the Seahawks.   Darrell Jackson is the clear # 1
guy although Koren Robinson will see his share of passes.   The Giants rank
# 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Johnson threw an ugly game last week with 191 yards, 0 TDs and 2
Interceptions.   If a team finds a way to limit Keyshawn Johnson, the
passing game is gone.   Granted, most teams have trouble keeping Keyshawn
from getting his catches, but the over reliance on one receiver severely
restricts the offense in my opinion.   Warrick Dunn saw plenty of passes
Sunday but it wasn't enough.   At this point, Keyshawn is the only
consistent starter in this passing game.   New Orleans ranks # 17 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks after the St. Louis game
Monday night.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble
for the Offense.


Carolina Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense

Surely, you're not down to Chris Weinke are you?   Even with a week to rest,
I'm not excited about their prospects.   Muhsin Muhammad might be an option
for some teams.   TE Wesley Walls just doesn't seem to consistently get on
the same page as Weinke.   The Rams rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

Don't even go there.   Maybe Peter Warrick in a stretch if you're desperate
but that's pretty much it.   This team is all about Corey Dillon.
Unfortunately, the Ravens picked up on that as well.   They rank # 31 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks with 811 passing
yards allowed in 3 games.   For the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Even so, I'd
still avoid.


Detroit Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

Mike McMahon led the Lions to the feel good story of the week Sunday as they
beat the Vikings.   Hats off to them and their fans.   They kept playing
hard.   Mike McMahon looked very good and definitely showed some flashes of
talent with his scrambling ability.   He threw for 241 yards with 0 TDs but
also 0 Interceptions.   Johnnie Morton is the clear cut # 1 Guy but Scottie
Anderson did well too.   The Steelers rank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks primarily because nobody can run on them.
For the year, they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Start Aaron Brooks.   Like you need me to tell you that.   Joe Horn and
probably Willie Jackson are starters in your league as well.   Looks like
Cam Cleeland has taken over all of the work Boo Williams was seeing at TE.
These guys are hot.   Ricky Williams reportedly has a hairline fracture in
one of his ribs but is expected to play.   You have to think this will at
least throw a little more focus on the passing game though.   The Bucs rank
# 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're
tough.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Giants Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

Collins has been up and down.   He did have 2 TDs last week but only threw
for 147 yards.   Amani Toomer was the clear # 1 Guy with Ike Hilliard
apparently hurting.   Ron Dixon got into the action with a TD but he's
inconsistent.   The Seahawks rank a very solid # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


San Francisco Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

The 49ers showed Sunday they can win in different ways as they rode the legs
of Garrison Hearst and the RB corps to victory.   Jeff Garcia did very
little throwing for 133 yards and a TD.   He'll likely be needed more this
week.   Terrell Owens is still his clear cut go to guy.   Garcia could make
the Eagles pay with their blitz happy defense.   Philadelphia ranks # 12 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Washington Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

Tony Banks struggled last week throwing for 213 yards, 0 TDs and 2
Interceptions.   His WR corps of Westbrook and Gardner have been ok but not
great lately.   TE Zeron Flemister did see several passes thrown his way
again.   He's worth a shot if you're in need of a TE.   The Bears have
improved lately against the pass ranking # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major
problems for the Offense.


Arizona Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Jake Plummer played decent last week with 207 yards and 1 TD.   David Boston
is a must start at WR.   For you guys desperate for a TE, look at Twayn
Mitchell who had 7 catches for 62 yards a TD.   You could do a lot worse.
We'll see if he can keep that up.   The Cowboys rank # 1 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so
this will be no cakewalk.


Chicago Passing Game vs Washington Defense

Jim Miller isn't carrying anyone's FF Team lately.   Although his 190 yards
and 2 TDs Sunday weren't bad.   Marty Booker is still seeing a ton of balls
thrown his way.   And Dez White is seeing action.   David Terrell makes the
most of what he gets but he's not seeing a lot of passes.   This team is
about Anthony Thomas and smashmouth football.   They'll have occasional
outbursts of big plays but primarily, it's Thomas.   The Redskins have been
very good lately ranking # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense

We got the predicted bounceback from Manning as he threw for 325 yards and 3
TDs with 1 Interception.   He's been up and down so let's see if he can keep
it up.   Of course Marvin Harrison is the prime target but rookie Reggie
Wayne's seeing lots of passes too.   TE Marcus Pollard was very involved in
the game plan last week as well.   The Jets rank # 4 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
Tough matchup.


New England Passing Game vs Miami Defense

Tom Brady continues his slide back to Earth.   He threw for 237 yards, 0 TDs
and 1 Interception last week.   But the Patriots won and that's all they
care about.   Troy Brown is being hurt by Terry Glenn's return.   Brown,
Glenn and David Patten all seem to be seeing fairly equal number of
opportunities.   The Dolphins are tough against the pass ranking # 6 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.

"venture","Eric - it was good to see you again after all this time. Sounds like you are well on your way to making things happen for yourself. Anyway - I am definitely new in this town as far as I am concerned. So - I don't want to burden you with spending any time with my sorry ass - but to the extent that you want to grab your girlfriend and a friend of hers - I would always be willing to venture out. I definitely need to meet some new people. In any event, I'm sure that we will run into each other plenty at the gym, etc. Talk to you soon Eric.

A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out."" Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
""And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
""Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock."" He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
""Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. ""Whazzis?,"" I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, ""Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?""
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters ""S"",
""K"", and ""A"" in the
""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides ""You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle ""Neon
Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do ""the bathroom
Brice."" There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
""Niiiiiice
cock."" No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did
you get
that, sir?"" I tell him (no shit):
""Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?"" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
""worst fucking
call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. ""Perhaps,"" I think to
myself, ""I'm
taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, ""I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in."" We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear ""Last call
for alcohol!"" I
turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..."" We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

Hi Folks,

Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for
exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always
receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia
may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt
Warner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up
against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box
when it comes to deciding between players.

Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike
Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.
Let's get to it.

Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

What a fitting way to wind down the season Sunday as Jon Kitna and Kordell
Stewart combined for 662 passing yards and 5 TDs.Kitna had 411 of those
yards.   Wow.   When you throw it 68 times, most every receiver will be
involved and that's what happened Sunday.   Peter Warrick was very active -
maybe the benching helped in week 15.   The Titans rank # 31 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so this is enticing although
you have to wonder if Kitna can do it again.   For the year, Tennessee ranks
# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
Check the cheatsheets to see where we rank these guys but clearly, it's a
good matchup.


Denver Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

Griese only put up 142 yards passing Sunday but it was enough.   Expect him
to do better this week.   Rod Smith is of course, the man here and he'll do
well too.   The Colts rank # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 27 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs Denver Defense

Manning came up small in the yardage department with under 200 yards Sunday
but he did run in one score.   Marvin Harrison is of course the clear cut go
to guy.   Manning's a competitor and you'd have to think he'll give a great
effort in the final week with nothing but pride to play for.   The Broncos
rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


St. Louis Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Mike Martz showed last week he'll let his guys play.   Regardless of the
playoff situation, I think you'll see Warner in for at least a half and
maybe much more.   And like Marshall Faulk, a half of Warner is better than
a full game from most other players.   Picking the WR is a lottery shot as
Holt, Bruce, Proehl, or Hakim are all liable to go off.   The Falcons rank #
26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 30 Fantasy Points Allowed
to WRs.



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong
lately.


Carolina Passing Game vs New England Defense


Can't imagine you're in week 17 with many Carolina guys on the roster.
Weinke did ok last week.   It's tough when you're upset about Isaac Byrd
possibly missing time but that's where they are.   Both he and Muhsin
Muhammad could miss the last game.   The Patriots rank # 28 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks so they're definitely vulnerable.
For the year, they rank # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 20 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.   It's a good matchup simply because New England hasn
't been much on defense.   I have little faith in the Carolina players to
take advantage of the matchup though.


Chicago's Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

When you think it's going to be all Anthony Thomas, Jim Miller and the
passing game decided to show off.   Miller put up 252 yards and 2 TDs as the
Bears continued to roll.   Marty Booker continues to see lots more passes
than any other Bear although David Terrell seems to make the most of what he
's thrown.   The Jaguars rank # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Dallas Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

Quincy Morgan showed some very nice flashes Sunday hitting Joey Galloway
deep.   Galloway seems to be the WR of choice.   He's worth a gamble for
sure.   The Lions rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and
# 29 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so it's a nice matchup.   It all depends
on whether these guys have the talent to take advantage of it.   One more
thing, the Cowboys will be doing all they can to get Emmitt Smith his 1,000
yard season so that may be a factor.


Kansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

Trent Green quietly carried some FF teams Sunday with 2 TDs and 294 yards.
Tony Gonzalez finally put together a game like we've been expecting.   He
saw 3 times as many passes as the WRs.   Maybe that'll continue this week.
The Seahawks rank # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Miami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense


Jay Fiedler posted a couple of TDs with his 191 yards which isn't bad.
Chris Chambers, Jed Weaver and Oronde Gadsden all saw time but RB Travis
Minor seemed to be the primary receiver with 7 catches.   Look for him to be
used more as Lamar Smith struggles.   The Bills rank # 29 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New England Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

Tom Brady's had a week to get ready for the Carolina defense.   Two teams
going drastically different directions here.   Terry Glenn could continue to
make an impact and you know Troy Brown's ready.   The Panthers rank # 20 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 28 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.



Seattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense

Hindsight is 20/20 but if Trent Dilfer isn't the most under appreciated
player in the NFL, I dunno who is.   He's won a jillion games including a
Superbowl lately and all he did Sunday was throw 3 TDs and save the Seahawks
season (at least for another week)   The big question is will he get another
shot?   Hasselbeck is saying he wants to play.  Stay tuned.   Darrell
Jackson went nuts last week and if Dilfer gets the nod, you have to look
hard at him.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 12 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


San Francisco Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Jeff Garcia threw for 229 and 2 TDs against a tough Cowboy pass Defense last
week.   Plus he rushed for another TD.   Terrell Owens is a must start.
J.J. Stokes is seeing lots of action and TE Eric Johnson is very involved.
The Saints defense ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 23 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Baltimore Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

Elvis Grbac had Raven fans wondering about Trent Dilfer again last week with
205 yards and 2 Interceptions to go with his TD.   The usual suspects of
Qadry Ismail, Shannon Sharpe and Travis Taylor will all be active.   The
Vikings rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 20 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Green Bay Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense

Favre came up small last week with just 169 yards and 0 TDs.   Granted, it
was really cold, but that hasn't seemed to bother him much in the past.
Freeman and Schroeder got most of the looks as usual.   TE Bubba Franks saw
a handful thrown his way.   They'll face the banged Giant secondary this
week ranked # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

Aaron Brooks took a step back this week with 3 Interceptions vs 1 TD and
just 127 yards.   It's not good when Deuce McAllister is the leading
receiver but that's what happened Sunday.   Joe Horn and Willie Jackson came
up small.   This week, they'll face a 49er defense that's ranked # 16 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 13 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

Stewart threw for 251 yards and 3 TDs Sunday although he did have 4
Interceptions.   Plaxico Burress is clearly the big play threat and is
showing shades of becoming a dominant WR.   Hines Ward is solid as well.
The Browns rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Steve McNair continues to play well with 274 yards and 2 TDs.   He's a
totally different QB when he throws the deep ball.   Although Eddie George's
re-emergence may quiet that a bit.   Dyson and Mason both saw an equal
number of passes and both scored.   This week, they'll face a Bengal defense
ranked # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 16 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Washington Passing Game vs Arizona Defense


Tony Banks put up a whopping 94 yards passing last week.   But part of it
was the big lead Washington was able to post.   Westbrook left with an ankle
injury so Gardner and TE Zeron Flemister caught what was thrown.   This
week, they'll face a Cardinal defense that's been pretty good lately ranking
# 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 25 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 26 Fantasy Points Allowed
to WRs.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong
lately.


Atlanta Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense


Mike Vick could see the start even if Chandler is ok.   The team is clearly
looking at 2002.   He's a dice roll if he starts but it's not like Chandler
was consistent.   Vick will likely spread the ball around to Terance Mathis,
Shawn Jefferson and Brian Finneran but it's tough to count on this team.
The Rams rank # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 14 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 8 Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

For the 2nd week in a row, Couch exploited a great matchup and lit up
Tennessee for 336 yards and 3 TDs.   Kevin Johnson was clearly the WR of
choice again.   This week, they'll face a Steeler defense that ranks # 15 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they
rank # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 7 Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

Mark Brunell put together another gritty day with 283 yards and a TD Sunday.
Keenan McCardell and Jimmy Smith continue to be one of the toughest WR duos
in the league.   They'll face a Bear defense this week ranked # 17 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Clearly, the stats
don't quite back up their rep lately.   For the year, they rank # 8 Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 2 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been
stingy allowing FF points.


Minnesota Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

Spergon Wynn could well be an NFL QB someday but today isn't that day.
Really puts the Cris Carter / Randy Moss owners in a bind.  Normally, they'
re sure starts but now I'm not so certain.   He really looked bad at times.
Both these receivers are guys who can make up for deficiencies at QB so I
still think you'll have to look hard there.   Plus, it's on Monday night so
even though the Vikes have pretty much packed it in, they'll probably put
forth a good effort.   The Ravens rank # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 Fantasy Points Allowed
to QBs and # 18 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Giants Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

Kerry Collins went over 300 yards last week and that was something.   Tiki
Barber is still the most frequent target with Toomer and Hilliard seeing
pretty much equal attention.   The Packers rank # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last 4 weeks.  For the year, they rank # 12 Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Jets Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

Vinny Testeverde looked pretty old in the loss to Buffalo with 0 TDs and 2
Interceptions.   Chrebet and Coles are decent options but this team is all
about Curtis Martin.   Especially with the Oakland Corners.   The Raiders
rank # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 10 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 13 Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Oakland Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense

Rich Gannon had an excellent day with 313 yards and 2 TDs although he did
have the 2 Interceptions.   Jerry Rice and Tim Brown continue to play well
and Charlie Garner does a nice job catching the ball.   The Jets are in a
must win situation and rank # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they've been tough.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Donovan McNabb started looking for receivers not named Duce Staley last week
and better things seemed to happen.   He threw for 3 TDs and nearly 300
yards.   James Thrash saw most of the passes while TE Chad Lewis burst back
onto the scene.   They'll face a Buc defense this week ranked # 6 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 11
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

Brad Johnson is trying to set a dink and dunk record I think.   He had 90
yards passing on 29 attempts for an amazing 3.10 yards per attempt.
Keyshawn Johnson is still probably a starter but that's pathetic.   This
week, they'll face an Eagle defense that's ranked # 23 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 1 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong
lately.


Arizona Passing Game vs Washington Defense

Start David Boston.   You already know that.   I'd say Plummer merits
consideration in lots of leagues too.   Boston again went nuts last week.
The Redskins rank # 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Even with this tough matchup, Boston is a
sure starter unless you're comically loaded at WR.


Buffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense


Van Pelt threw for under 200 yards but the Bills did get the win.   It looks
to me like Jay Riemersma is the primary target now.   Eric Moulds and
Peerless Price are good gambles but far from sure things.   The Dolphins
rank # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 6 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 10 Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Detroit Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Mike McMahon could miss another game which means Ty Detmer could start.
Sounds funny, but he put together one of the bigger days among QBs Sunday.
He threw the ball all over the field.  Johnnie Morton and Cory Schlesinger
were especially involved.   The Cowboys rank # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last 4 weeks so it'll be tough.   For the year, they rank
# 4 Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.

"Yeah Orange....","Gentlemen and ladies,

Check it out, OSU beat OU (NO ONE thought THAT was possible) we are going to 
the Big 12 Championship game VS. Colorado.

Damn we're smooth.


Hook'em Horns.

Brett.

AUSTIN -- Texas coach Mack Brown was channel surfing through college 
football Saturday, hoping his team would get a break.

It wasn't too long before his television was locked in on the second half of 
Oklahoma State's 16-13 upset of Oklahoma.

His phone was ringing off the hook as the final seconds ticked down. Brown's 
fifth-ranked Longhorns were now Big 12 South Division champs and headed to 
the conference title game next Saturday against Colorado.

""I had some players calling and screaming with 20 seconds left,"" Brown said.

""Our two sons and my wife were screaming and shouting like they were on the 
sidelines. We had some unsportsmanlike conduct there, I think.""

Brown said he tried to stay calm after the Cowboys took the lead in the 
final two minutes. He was trying to figure out how many timeouts and how 
much yardage the Sooners needed to pull off the victory or at least tie and 
send it to overtime.

""That's what coaches do,"" Brown said. ""We're trying to figure out how to win 
the game.""

Ranked 11th or higher all season, Texas (10-1, 7-1 Big 12) had been on the 
outside looking in at the South division title. The Sooners handed Texas its 
only defeat back in October and had the head-to-head advantage before 
Saturday.

The Sooners were heavy favorites to beat Oklahoma State before the loss 
dropped the Sooners to 10-2 overall, 6-2 in the Big 12.

""You really don't know in this crazy game of college football what's going 
to happen,"" Brown said. ""As of yesterday, nobody thought Colorado and Texas 
would be in this ball game.""

Colorado (9-2, 7-1) won the North division with its 62-36 whipping of 
Nebraska on Friday, a game the Texas players could listen to on their way 
home from a 21-7 win over Texas A&M.

The Longhorns defeated Colorado 41-7 back in October. Brown said the rematch 
should be much closer.

""We won the game handily but they had some turnovers early in the game. 
Obviously they're playing much better now than they were then,"" he said.

Colorado coach Gary Barnett said his team is happy to have another crack at

"Jason C. Bass wants you to create an Amazon.com Wish List","Jason C. Bass was unable to find a Wish List for you at Amazon.com and asked us to send you e-mail, requesting that you create one. 

Now--we don't presume to tell you what to do. But if someone wanted to
buy stuff for us and asked that we create a Wish List...well, let's just say we know what we'd do. Here's Jason C. Bass's personal plea to you: 

Hello,
I was looking for your Wish List at Amazon.com,
but I couldn't find it. I want to buy you
something and I want to make sure it's
something you really want. Create a Wish List
at Amazon.com so I know what to get you.
Thanks!

How could you resist? To set up a Wish List, visit www.amazon.com/new-wishlist

Many thanks. And happy wishing!

McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness.

Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago.

CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego.

Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1704&key=1041&""><B>Drew Bledsoe</B></A>, QB NE - The Executioners <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1704&key=1171&""><B>Warrick Dunn</B></A>, RB TB - One Man Show <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury.

"Dad's Birthday","Hi Eric,

Would you and Shanna please do me a huge favor on the way over on Saturday?  Please stop at Kroger or Randall's and buy 5 or 6 balloons for Dad's birthday.  I sure would appreciate that and I am sure he will too.  LU-M

"Good Morning","Hi Eric,
 
It looks like Enron employees have an enterprising spirit according to the H. Chronicle.  Ebay is saturated with Enron goodies.  This is quite amusing.
 
Sorry about tonight and we will miss you on your birthday.  We will celebrate whenever you wish, just let us know.  If you change your mind about tomorrow, email me.  Donnita and Jason are coming over for dinner.  We would love for you to come.  
 
Have a wonderful day.  LU-M

"RE: Yeah Orange....","Hey Eric,

Christ almighty, u still got a job?  I bought into Enron at $38 or so.....

ENE.  I should get to watch the game this saturday and am pretty pumped 
about it.

Telluride with Marilyn from 22 Dec to 27 Dec to do the whole proposal thing

"a prayer"," 
----- Original Message ----- 



Please take a moment to relax your mind and humble your heart to focus on 
Christ. Allow God, to be the only person on your mind while you read this 
prayer. If we can take the time to read long jokes and stories, we 
should give the same respect to this prayer. Friends that pray together, 
stay together. 

 
 
Dear Lord, I thank You for this day.
 I thank You for my being able to see and to hear this morning. 
 I'm blessed because You are a forgiving God and an understanding God.
 You have done so much for me and You keep on blessing me.  
 Forgive me this day for everything I have done, said or thought that was not pleasing to you. I ask now for Your forgiveness.  
 Please keep me safe from all danger and harm. 
 Help me to start this day with a new attitude and plenty of gratitude. 
 Let me make the best of each and every day to clear my mind so that I can hear from You. 
 Please broaden my mind so that I can accept all things. 
 Let me not whine and whimper about things over which I have no control.
 Let me continue to see sin through God's eyes and acknowledge it as evil. And when I sin, let me repent, and confess with my mouth my 
wrongdoing, and receive the forgiveness of God.  
 And when this world closes in on me, let me remember Jesus' example-to slip away and find a quiet 
place to pray. It's the best response when I'm pushed beyond my limits. 
 I know that when I can't pray, You listen to my heart.  
 Continue to use me to do Your will.  
 Continue to bless me that I may be a blessing to others. 
 Keep me strong that I may help the weak. 
 Keep me uplifted that I may have words of encouragement for others. 
 I pray for those that are lost and can't find their way.  
 I pray for those that are misjudged and misunderstood. 
 I pray for those who don't know You intimately. 
 I pray for those that don't believe. But I thank you that I believe.  
 I believe that God changes people and God changes things. 
 I pray for all my sisters and brothers and for each and every family member in their households.  I pray for peace, love and joy for each of them and that all their needs are met.  
 I pray that every eye that reads this knows there is no problem, circumstance, or situation greater than God. Every battle is in Your hands  for You to fight. 
 I pray that these words be received into the hearts of every eye that sees them and every mouth that confesses them willingly.  
 This is my prayer.  In Jesus' Name, 
 Amen. 

. 
God Bless Each of You.

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Hi,

	This is to inform everyone that we will be gathering for a happy hour at Cafe Adobe this Friday Feb 1,2002.  We plan to be there right after work from 5:00pm till 7:00pm.  It is located at Westheimer Rd and Kirby (2111 Westheimer Rd, 713-528-1468).  There is plenty of parking on the street and in a few parking lots but it does get quite busy during happy hour.  The drinks are reasonably priced and there are nachos and finger foods.
Please forward this e-mail to anyone that might want to join us including colleagues/spouse/friends.

Thanks,
Kevin

"Fwd: Cave Memo","Subject: cave memo



To: Cave mates
From: Osama
Re: The Cave

Hi guys. We've all been putting in long hours but we've really come  
together  as a group and I love that. Big thanks to Omar for putting up the 
poster  that says, ""There is no I in team"" as well as the  one that says 
""Hang In There, Baby."" That cat is hilarious. However, while  we are 
fighting a  jihad, we can't  forget to take care of the cave. And frankly I 
have a few concerns.

First of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise missiles, we  
should be even  more concerned about the scorpions in our cave. Hey,  you 
don't want to be  stung and neither do I, so we need to sweep the cave  
daily. I've posted a  sign  up sheet near the main cave opening.

Second, it's not often I make a video address but  when I do, I'm trying to  
scare the most powerful country on earth, okay? That  means that while we're 
taping, please do not ride your razor scooters in  the background. Just  
while we're taping. Thanks.

Third point, and this is a touchy one. As you know,  by edict, we're not  
supposed to shave our beards. But I need everyone to just think hygiene,  
especially after mealtime. We're all in this  together.

Fourth: food. I bought a box of Cheez-Its recently,  clearly wrote ""Osama""  
on  the front, and put it on the top shelf. Today, my  Cheez-Its were gone.  
Consideration. That's all I'm saying.

Finally, we've heard that there may be American  soldiers in disguise trying 
  to infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up patrols to  look for them. First 
  patrol will be Omar, Muhammed, Abdul, Akbar, and  Richard.

Love you lots.
Osama

By the way, I signed with UBS today.  I ended up getting a little better deal than we talked about.  A 50% increase on the amounts.

I will sleep better now that I KNOW your interests are being so protected.-Dad   p.s.-sure hope they also look out for the interests of those of us that ""invested"" in ENE.

"NetcoOnline Launch Plans","
We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of ""NetcoOnline""

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, ""NetcoOnline"" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Kara Boudreau (30570) - Gas
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power
Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas


Definitions:
	
Password Application (PA) - Only document where a physical signature is required  by an authorized person (Master User)

Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) - Must be accepted online by the Master User before they can proceed into NetcoOnline

Master User - Typically the company authorized signatory that signed the Password Application. Establishes transaction rights for each trader (sub-users)

Sub-User - Trader, assigned either execute or read only status 

General Terms & Conditions (GTC) - Document that governs online trades unless a Master Agreement is in place

Master Agreement - Document that governs online and offline trades and supersedes the GTC

    MEMO FROM GOD  
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/Btflysilver.gif>
To: YOU  
Date: TODAY 
From: THE BOSS  
Subject: YOURSELF  
Reference: LIFE  
I am God. Today I will be handling all of your problems. Please remember that I do not need your help.  
If life happens to deliver a situation to you that you cannot handle, do not attempt to resolve it. Kindly put it in the SFGTD (something for God to do) box. All situations will be resolved, but in My time, not yours. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/sfgtd.gif>
Once the matter is placed into the box, do not hold onto it by worrying about it.  Instead, focus on all the wonderful things that are present in your life now. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/swing.gif>
If you find yourself stuck in traffic; Don't despair. There are people in this world for whom driving is an unheard of privilege. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/traffic.gif>
Should you have a bad day at work; Think of the man who has been out of work for years. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/man_walk.gif>
Should you despair over a relationship gone bad; Think of the person who has never known what it's like to love and be loved in return. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/rockincrotchity1x1.gif>
Should you grieve the passing of another weekend;  Think of the woman in dire straits, working twelve hours a day, seven days a week to feed her children. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/sew2.gif>
Should your car break down, leaving you miles away from assistance; Think of the paraplegic who would love the opportunity to take that walk.  
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/wheelchr.gif>
Should you notice a new gray hair in the mirror; Think of the cancer patient in chemo who wishes she had hair to examine. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/nurse_use.gif>
Should you find yourself at a loss and pondering what is life all about, asking what is my purpose? Be thankful. There are those who didn't live long enough to get the opportunity. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/angel_baby.jpg>
Should you find yourself the victim of other people's bitterness, ignorance, smallness or insecurities; Remember, things could be worse. You could be one of them! 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/women_talking.gif>
Should you decide to send this to a friend; Thank you, you may have touched their life in ways you will never know!

"**IMPORTANT** Stack Manager Users","
We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

UBS Warburg estimates that profits
from European power trading alone
will top $2.4 billion in 2002

Now in its 3rd year, this is THE conference where the European Energy Industry talks about the business of energy trading. Case studies from traders, brokers, online exchanges and energy companies to help you stay at the forefront of the exploding energy trading market.

Jonathan Johns, Ernst & Young

Emission trading options are ripe for the picking - but how can you make sure you're ready to profit from GHG?

"Online Trading Simulation","We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

"Employee Meeting Postponed","We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

"BCP Seat Assignments","All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

"Access Card Information","
Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness.

Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago.

CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=136&key=1871&""><B>Todd Bouman</B></A>, QB MIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury.

Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=136&key=1041&""><B>Drew Bledsoe</B></A>, QB NE - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/29/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=136&key=1171&""><B>Warrick Dunn</B></A>, RB TB - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury.

He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=136&key=1612&""><B>Oronde Gadsden</B></A>, WR MIA - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/28/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>

"A Christmas message from Bruce Eberle","""I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the
people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you;
he is Christ the Lord."" Luke 2:10, 11

Dear Americans,

As we prepare to celebrate the birthday of Jesus Christ, let
me take this opportunity to wish you a joyous Christmas
celebration and peace in the New Year. May the true meaning
of Christmas, God's gift of His own son as our savior, be
yours in this holiday season and throughout the New Year.

May God continue to bless our nation and its leaders,
especially President George Bush, as we confront an enemy
who hates everything this nation stands for -- peace,
freedom, justice, and faith.

""May the Lord our God be with us as he was with our fathers;
may he never leave or forsake us."" 1 Kings 8:57

For America,

Bruce W. Eberle
