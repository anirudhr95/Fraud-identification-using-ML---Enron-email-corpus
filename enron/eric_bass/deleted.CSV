Latest NFL Player News

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 01/08/02
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Bettis will play in the team's Divisional Playoff Game in two weeks. ""There's no question about the next game,"" Bettis said, ""I'll be fine."" Bettis missed Pittsburgh's final five games of the year due to a groin injury, but seems to have healed sufficiently enough to get back into the starting lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to Phillynews.com, Buckhalter will see an increase in playing time behind starter Duce Staley on Saturday against Tampa Bay. Buckhalter, who ran for 89 yards against the Bucs on Sunday night, may even find himself in the same backfield as Staley in certain sets. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 01/08/02
Starting tailback Charlie Garner is a bit banged up, so Wheatley could see some additional carries on Saturday against the N.Y. Jets. ""He gave us some pop inside, inside the five (-yard line),"" Head Coach Jon Gruden told the Contra Costa Times . ""The physical finish that allowed us to score a touchdown early in the game was vintage Tyrone Wheatley. No question, we'd like to see a heavier dose of the big man as the playoffs begin."" Garner is expected to start, but Wheatley will likely get a majority of the short-yard and goal-line carries. 

Bills <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=4&>, DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Defensive end Phil Hansen announced his retirement from football this week. ""My body and my heart tell me it's time to move on. I've known for a long time now that this would be my final season. I tried to keep it a secret because I didn't want it to become a distraction to any of my teammates,"" Hansen told the Boston Globe . Hansen started his career by making three straight Super Bowl appearances, but he ended his 11-year tenure one day after the Bills worst season (3-13) since 1985.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 01/08/02
Gadsden, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo with a hamstring injury, will start on Sunday against Baltimore. However, he may be hard pressed to up good numbers against the Ravens' tough secondary. 

Dolphins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=15&>, DT MIA - Martin Updated 01/08/02
Linebacker Zach Thomas missed Sunday's game against Buffalo because of muscle spasms in his neck and pain from a muscle strain in his shoulder. ""I won't be [sitting out] this week,"" Thomas told the Miami Herald. Thomas said he would have played if it were a playoff game, but he sat out so he wouldn't worsen the injuries for the postseason. 

Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Chambers suffered a sprained right ankle during Sunday's win over Buffalo. The rookie now has sprains in both of his ankles, and was removed from the game as a precaution. However, Chambers is expected to play in Sunday's game against Baltimore. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1226&>, WR GB - Hunter Updated 01/08/02
Freeman is nursing sore ribs, but he is expected to play on Sunday against San Francisco. The veteran wideout finished the regular season with 52 catches for 818 yards and five touchdowns. 

D'Wayne Bates <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=133222&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Bates could remain the No. 2 receiver for Chicago even if Dez White returns from a hamstring injury. ""It's something we'll have to look at,"" Coach Dick Jauron said. ""Hopefully Dez will be back and ready to play, and then we'll! s! ee where he is. Dez has done a real nice job for us, and D'Wayne has certainly stepped up and played really well."" Bates has been productive in White's absence, posting 157 yards receiving over the past two games. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 01/08/02
Brookins returned from a foot injury on Monday night against Minnesota. He carried the ball seven times for 15 yards, and is expected to see an increase in his carries next Sunday against Miami. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 01/08/02
Janikowski will be available for Saturday's Wild Card Game against the N.Y. Jets. He had been dealing with a bout of cellulitis in his foot, but seems to have healed sufficiently after missing the team's regular season finale. 

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Fuamatu-Ma'afala left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a minor groin injury. The injury isn't considered serious, however, so Fuamatu-Ma'afala will be ready for Pittsburgh's Divisional Playoff game in two weeks. 

Seahawks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Linebacker Anthony Simmons left Sunday's game against Kansas City in the second quarter after suffering a bruised left thigh. He did not return, and was on crutches and had his thigh heavily bandaged after the game. Corner! ba! ck Shawn Springs started the game at cornerback, but played only the first series before leaving with a nagging hamstring injury. ""If we had to play one more football game, I'm not sure they could go next week,"" Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 

Eddie Kennison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1296&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Kennison suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. The injury isn't considered serious. Kennison had three catches for 74 yards in the game, and finished the year with 31 receptions for 491 yards and one touchdown. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 01/07/02
Warner was hit in the throat during Sunday's St. Louis' 31-13 win over Atlanta, and has been told not to talk for a week. ""They gave him some steroids, I think, to keep the swelling down, but he's fine,"" Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Warner said he got hit with either or knee or an elbow. ""They just think there's some swelling around the vocal chords,"" Warner said. ""It was tough to call (plays) in the huddle. Guys were laughing at me a little bit."" Warner is fine and will start in the Divisional Round of the playoffs in two weeks. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 01/07/02
Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. ""It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain,"" Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game."" Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
McNair missed the second half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to back spasms. The injury isn't considered serious. McNair had an outstanding season, finishing with 3,350 yards passing and 26 total touchdowns. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Banks suffered a sprained right knee in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 20-17 win over Arizona. Banks, who may have played his final game as a Washington Redskin, will be re-evaluated this week. 

Charlie Garner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 01/07/02
Garner suffered a foot injury during Sunday's 24-22 loss to the N.Y. Jets. He finished the game, however, and is expected to start in Oakland's opening-round playoff game. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 01/07/02
Janikowski missed Sunday's game against the N.Y. Jets due to a bout with cellulitis in his foot. Brad Daluiso kicked in his absence, and missed one field goal and an extra point. Janikowski will be re-evaluated this week, and should be available for Oakland's opening-round playoff game, barring any setbacks. 

Amani Toomer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 01/07/02
Toomer suffered a concussion during Sunday's 34-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers. The injury isn't considered too serious. Toomer finished the game with five receptions for 79 yards, giving him 72 catches for 1,054 yards and five touchdowns on the year. 

Terry Glenn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 01/07/02
Glenn was inactive for Sunday's game against Carolina, and didn't make the trip to Charlotte with the team. According to the Boston Globe, there was much speculation as to why Glenn didn't play. One report indicated New England has already decided not to play him in the playoffs, and another said Glenn had missed meetings. Glenn did have an excused absence Wednesday, when he had to attend to a personal matter. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 01/07/02
Horn left Sunday's game against San Francisco in the third quarter with a sprained left knee and did not return. He caught three passes for 44 yards before suffering the injury, and finished the season with 83 catches for 1,265 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns. 

Cris Carter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 01/07/02
Carter (ribs) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Baltimore. It is still uncertain whether or not Carter will play, so Jake Reed could see some extended playing time. In any event, the game will likely be Carter's last in a Minnesota Vikings' uniform. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 01/07/02
Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. ""Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury,"" General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. ""The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look."" Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season. Furth! er! tests are expected to be taken this week. 

Mike Hollis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1387&>, K JAC - Giggles Updated 01/07/02
Hollis was benched late in Sunday's game against Chicago after having a first-quarter field goal blocked and later missing his second extra point of the season. Hollis, who is now an unrestricted free agent, is not expected to return to the Jaguars for the 2002 season. 

Marcus Pollard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Pollard left Sunday's game against Denver in the third quarter with a sprained left knee. He finished the contest with two catches for 11 yards in the Colts' 29-10 victory. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 01/07/02
Stewart (ankle) played in Sunday's game against Dallas after being listed as questionable for most of the week. The veteran tailback rushed for 69 yards in Detroit's 15-10 win. 

Terrell Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 01/07/02
According to the Denver Post , Davis expects to return to Denver for the 2002 season. ""I expect to be back, unless you know something I don't know,"" Davis said. ""I want to be here. I think we'll find a happy medium for both sides. It will be a win-win situation, I believe."" Davis is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent.

Jason Elam <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4345&key=1383&>, K DEN - Martin Updated 01/07/02

"Yeah Orange....","Gentlemen and ladies,

Check it out, OSU beat OU (NO ONE thought THAT was possible) we are going to 
the Big 12 Championship game VS. Colorado.

Damn we're smooth.


Hook'em Horns.

Brett.

AUSTIN -- Texas coach Mack Brown was channel surfing through college 
football Saturday, hoping his team would get a break.

It wasn't too long before his television was locked in on the second half of 
Oklahoma State's 16-13 upset of Oklahoma.

His phone was ringing off the hook as the final seconds ticked down. Brown's 
fifth-ranked Longhorns were now Big 12 South Division champs and headed to 
the conference title game next Saturday against Colorado.

""I had some players calling and screaming with 20 seconds left,"" Brown said.

""Our two sons and my wife were screaming and shouting like they were on the 
sidelines. We had some unsportsmanlike conduct there, I think.""

Brown said he tried to stay calm after the Cowboys took the lead in the 
final two minutes. He was trying to figure out how many timeouts and how 
much yardage the Sooners needed to pull off the victory or at least tie and 
send it to overtime.

""That's what coaches do,"" Brown said. ""We're trying to figure out how to win 
the game.""

Ranked 11th or higher all season, Texas (10-1, 7-1 Big 12) had been on the 
outside looking in at the South division title. The Sooners handed Texas its 
only defeat back in October and had the head-to-head advantage before 
Saturday.

The Sooners were heavy favorites to beat Oklahoma State before the loss 
dropped the Sooners to 10-2 overall, 6-2 in the Big 12.

""You really don't know in this crazy game of college football what's going 
to happen,"" Brown said. ""As of yesterday, nobody thought Colorado and Texas 
would be in this ball game.""

Colorado (9-2, 7-1) won the North division with its 62-36 whipping of 
Nebraska on Friday, a game the Texas players could listen to on their way 
home from a 21-7 win over Texas A&M.

The Longhorns defeated Colorado 41-7 back in October. Brown said the rematch 
should be much closer.

""We won the game handily but they had some turnovers early in the game. 
Obviously they're playing much better now than they were then,"" he said.

Colorado coach Gary Barnett said his team is happy to have another crack at 
Texas.

""We'll be primed for the rematch,"" Barnett said. ""We know we didn't play 
very well the first time and we'd like to think that wasn't who we really 
are.""

Good evening Sons:
 
Okay, have rented  Ford Expedition. It has 2 front bucket seats and 2 bench seats. I am assured it will comfortable seat 8. 
 
I suggest we all meet @ 5. The drive is probably only 1-1 1/2 hours, but the ship leaves @ 7 whether we are there or not. Boarding starts @ 6:30.
 
I was thinking about all meeting in the  AMC theater parking lot on the north side, @ Sam Houston Tollroad and Richmond. Plenty of lighted parking and kinda centrally located. But, I am flexible.
 
What do you guys think?-Dad

"[Footballguys] Breaking News - Bills to Cut Arians","Entire story:   http://www.billsdaily.com/news/#112601

Bills To Cut Arians: Coach Williams said in his Monday press conference that
the Bills will make a move at kicker by the end of today and announce who
will be picked up tomorrow. The missed extra point was the last straw for
Jake Arians who struggled mightily as a rookie kicker in the NFL.


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


This wasn't hard to see coming after yesterday.   Poor Bills can't catch a
break.   Probably not a big deal for most of you, but didn't want any of you
Arians owners to get stuck on this short week if he was your guy.

Thanks to Footballguy Mike Webb for pointing me to this one.

"Get Ready for a Texas Showdown!","Dear eric,




ROCKETS TO DO BATTLE WITH THE MAVS SATURDAY

After trailing the Lakers by 15 points in the third quarter of last night's game, the Rockets needed a lift. They turned to the sold-out Compaq Center crowd and got what they were looking for. 

With the house-a-rockin', Steve, Cuttino and the gang led a furious second-half Rockets rally spurred by the energy of the sold-out arena. Although the comeback fell just short, the fans' support was a certain factor in the rally.

The Rockets will be looking for the same support Saturday when Michael Finley, Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks pay a visit to Compaq Center for a Texas Showdown. Game time is 7:30 p.m.

Tickets are going fast, so get yours today by calling 1-800-4NBA-TIX, visiting any Ticketmaster outlets or the Compaq Center box office, or ordering online at rockets.com (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=133970&UID=45456540&MID=188026).

See you at Compaq Center!

"New Date Rape Drug - Beware"," 
 
 
Now you know the rest of the story.
 
 
: New Date Rape Drug - Beware

 
DATE RAPE DRUG TARGETS MALES

 (URP) - Police warn all male clubbers, party-goers, and unsuspecting pub
 regulars to be alert and stay cautious when offered a drink from any woman.

 A new date rape drug on the market, called ""beer,"" is used by females to
 target unsuspecting men.

 The drug is generally found in liquid form, and is now available almost anywhere.
 ""Beer"" is used by female sexual predators at parties and bars to persuade their
 male victims to go home and have sex with them.
 Typically, a woman needs only to persuade a guy to consume a few units of
 ""beer"" and then simply ask him home for no-strings-attached sex.
 Men are rendered helpless against this approach. After several ""beers""
 men will often succumb to desires to perform sexual acts on horrific looking
 women to whom they would never normally be attracted.

After drinking ""beer,"" men often awaken with only hazy memories of
exactly what happened to them the night before, often with just a vague
feeling that something bad occurred. At other times these unfortunate men
 are swindled out of their life's savings in a familiar scam known as ""a
relationship.""

Apparently men are much more susceptible to this scam after ""beer"" is
 administered and sex is offered by the predatory female.

 Please! Forward this warning to every male you know.  However, if you fall
victim to this insidious ""beer"" and the predatory women administering it,
 there are male support groups with venues in every town where you can
discuss the details of your shocking encounter in an open and frank manner
with similarly affected, like-minded guys.  For the support group nearest you,
just look up ""Golf Courses"" in the yellow pages.

Look for Dyson to be a decent No. 2 receiver during the Fantasy postseason. He might not score, but he should catch a few passes. <BR>

Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement. But he is not accomplishing enough statistically to help most Fantasy teams. <BR>

Hearst rushed for 103 yards on 26 carries against Miami on Sunday. He was held out of the end zone, but Hearst is still a good enough player to start during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

Fiedler threw for 149 yards, no TDs and was intercepted three times at San Francisco. The Miami QB is too erratic to be a regular starter for any Fantasy team during the playoffs.<BR>

<A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3655&key=235093&""><B>Eric Johnson</B></A>, Reserve TE<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR>
Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against Carolina. Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't really worth starting at this point. <BR>

Head Coach Mike Martz announced that safeties Kim Herring (hamstring) and Adam Archuleta (hamstring), linebackers Mark Fields (thigh) and London Fletcher (hamstring) and CB Aeneas Williams (back) will be held out of the Rams' final preseason game. However, they will all be ready for the season opener against Philadelphia on September 9. The Rams defense is worth a late-round selection on Draft Day. <BR>

Wilkins is expected back Sunday from a quadriceps injury that took its time to heal. Wilkins missed five games and most of a sixth. Coach Mike Martz put him through rigorous tests Thursday and Friday to make sure he was ready to go for the game against the Carolina Panthers. Backup Jeff Hall will remain on the active roster until Sunday. ""I kicked a ton of kickoffs, field goals, everything on Thursday and today I did more field goals,"" Wilkins said. ""It felt great. I kicked all-out and there were no twinges, no tweaks."" <BR>

"New! snooze you lose fares!","Today's Hottest Travel Deals from Bestfares.com!


Check out our new section called Snooze You Lose Fares and it could save you big bucks. Plus, we are having a new coast-to-coast fare sale good for travel through June 14, 2002. Airfares start as low as $174 roundtrip. From Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, Washington (DC) and Atlanta to the West Coast you pay only $244 roundtrip. From Dallas, Detroit, Minneapolis, Milwaukee or Chicago, you pay only $174 roundtrip. We have unbelievable super low fares to Mexico beaches. From Dallas, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Houston and Detroit to Acapulco, Ixtapa, Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta or Los Cabos, you pay only $268 roundtrip.

SNOOZE YOU LOSE FARES: MORE UPDATES 3 TIMES A DAY 

Over the past 60 days, we have introduced our very popular Quickfare Finder that handles over 200,000 requests per day. We also introduced City Low Fare Search that ranks the fares from your city from the lowest to the highest. Now we have introduced Snooze You Lose Fares. This feature is updated three times a day and only ranks the airfares from your departing airport that we believe are great buys. Many times, you will find an airfare by the major airlines that is under four cents a mile. For example, today, we had Phoenix to Buffalo for $105 roundtrip. That's only two-and-a-half cents per mile. How about Cincinnati to San Francisco for $142 roundtrip (three-and-a-half cents per mile); Chicago to New York City for $121 roundtrip (three cents a mile) or Dallas to Raleigh for $70 roundtrip (three cents a mile)? We have hundreds and hundreds of Snooze You Lose Fares daily, but you must act fast. Check out our new Snooze You Lose section at http://quickfares.bestfares.com/quickfare/snoozefares.jsp and our Quickfare Finder at <http://quickfares.bestfares.com/quickfare/qfsearch.jsp> and City Low Fare Search at <http://quickfares.bestfares.com/quickfare/lowfares.jsp>

Subject: RE: Jason' Bachelor Party


I have made reservations for Jason's Bachelor Party.  You are the chosen
few.  The cruise is set for Sat. Jan 19 at 7 pm out of Freeport.
Transportation will be arranged for you.  We need to leave at about 5 pm on
the 19th.  I will arrange a meeting place and relay it to you in a future
e-mail.  The final tally will be $32 a person. I have paid for this already
so you can reimburse me on the 19th and I can promptly blow all of that
money on gambling.  Sadly, the gourmet dinner was not available on the
Freeport cruise so we will have to suffer through a buffet dinner.

Let me know if you have any questions.

-Eric

NFL Reports, Player Updates

Latest NFL Player News

Jerome Bettis <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/08/02
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Bettis will play in the team's Divisional Playoff Game in two weeks. ""There's no question about the next game,"" Bettis said, ""I'll be fine."" Bettis missed Pittsburgh's final five games of the year due to a groin injury, but seems to have healed sufficiently enough to get back into the starting lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=235031&>, RB PHI - The Lie Downs Updated 01/08/02
According to Phillynews.com, Buckhalter will see an increase in playing time behind starter Duce Staley on Saturday against Tampa Bay. Buckhalter, who ran for 89 yards against the Bucs on Sunday night, may even find himself in the same backfield as Staley in certain sets. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1140&>, RB OAK - One Man Show Updated 01/08/02
Starting tailback Charlie Garner is a bit banged up, so Wheatley could see some additional carries on Saturday against the N.Y. Jets. ""He gave us some pop inside, inside the five (-yard line),"" Head Coach Jon Gruden told the Contra Costa Times . ""The physical finish that allowed us to score a touchdown early in the game was vintage Tyrone Wheatley. No question, we'd like to see a heavier dose of the big man as the playoffs begin."" Garner is expected to start, but Wheatley will likely get a majority of the short-yard and goal-line carries. 

Bills <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=4&>, DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Defensive end Phil Hansen announced his retirement from football this week. ""My body and my heart tell me it's time to move on. I've known for a long time now that this would be my final season. I tried to keep it a secret because I didn't want it to become a distraction to any of my teammates,"" Hansen told the Boston Globe . Hansen started his career by making three straight Super Bowl appearances, but he ended his 11-year tenure one day after the Bills worst season (3-13) since 1985.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 01/08/02
Gadsden, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo with a hamstring injury, will start on Sunday against Baltimore. However, he may be hard pressed to up good numbers against the Ravens' tough secondary. 

Dolphins <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=15&>, DT MIA - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/08/02
Linebacker Zach Thomas missed Sunday's game against Buffalo because of muscle spasms in his neck and pain from a muscle strain in his shoulder. ""I won't be [sitting out] this week,"" Thomas told the Miami Herald. Thomas said he would have played if it were a playoff game, but he sat out so he wouldn't worsen the injuries for the postseason. 

Chris Chambers <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=235203&>, WR MIA - The Guzzlers Updated 01/08/02
Chambers suffered a sprained right ankle during Sunday's win over Buffalo. The rookie now has sprains in both of his ankles, and was removed from the game as a precaution. However, Chambers is expected to play in Sunday's game against Baltimore. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1226&>, WR GB - The Guzzlers Updated 01/08/02
Freeman is nursing sore ribs, but he is expected to play on Sunday against San Francisco. The veteran wideout finished the regular season with 52 catches for 818 yards and five touchdowns. 

D'Wayne Bates <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=133222&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Bates could remain the No. 2 receiver for Chicago even if Dez White returns from a hamstring injury. ""It's something we'll have to look at,"" Coach Dick Jauron said. ""Hopefully Dez will be back and ready to play, and then we'll! s! ee where he is. Dez has done a real nice job for us, and D'Wayne has certainly stepped up and played really well."" Bates has been productive in White's absence, posting 157 yards receiving over the past two games. 

Jason Brookins <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Not So Nice Machine Updated 01/08/02
Brookins returned from a foot injury on Monday night against Minnesota. He carried the ball seven times for 15 yards, and is expected to see an increase in his carries next Sunday against Miami. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=187389&>, K OAK - The Guzzlers Updated 01/08/02
Janikowski will be available for Saturday's Wild Card Game against the N.Y. Jets. He had been dealing with a bout of cellulitis in his foot, but seems to have healed sufficiently after missing the team's regular season finale. 

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Fuamatu-Ma'afala left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a minor groin injury. The injury isn't considered serious, however, so Fuamatu-Ma'afala will be ready for Pittsburgh's Divisional Playoff game in two weeks. 

Seahawks <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Linebacker Anthony Simmons left Sunday's game against Kansas City in the second quarter after suffering a bruised left thigh. He did not return, and was on crutches and had his thigh heavily bandaged after the game. Cornerback S! ha! wn Springs started the game at cornerback, but played only the first series before leaving with a nagging hamstring injury. ""If we had to play one more football game, I'm not sure they could go next week,"" Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 

Eddie Kennison <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1296&>, WR KC - One Man Show Updated 01/07/02
Kennison suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. The injury isn't considered serious. Kennison had three catches for 74 yards in the game, and finished the year with 31 receptions for 491 yards and one touchdown. 

Kurt Warner <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=12797&>, QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/07/02
Warner was hit in the throat during Sunday's St. Louis' 31-13 win over Atlanta, and has been told not to talk for a week. ""They gave him some steroids, I think, to keep the swelling down, but he's fine,"" Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Warner said he got hit with either or knee or an elbow. ""They just think there's some swelling around the vocal chords,"" Warner said. ""It was tough to call (plays) in the huddle. Guys were laughing at me a little bit."" Warner is fine and will start in the Divisional Round of the playoffs in two weeks. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1294&>, WR STL - The Guzzlers Updated 01/07/02
Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. ""It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain,"" Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game."" Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks. 

Steve McNair <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1069&>, QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 01/07/02
McNair missed the second half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to back spasms. The injury isn't considered serious. McNair had an outstanding season, finishing with 3,350 yards passing and 26 total touchdowns. 

Tony Banks <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Banks suffered a sprained right knee in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 20-17 win over Arizona. Banks, who may have played his final game as a Washington Redskin, will be re-evaluated this week. 

Charlie Garner <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1149&>, RB OAK - oops, I did it again Updated 01/07/02
Garner suffered a foot injury during Sunday's 24-22 loss to the N.Y. Jets. He finished the game, however, and is expected to start in Oakland's opening-round playoff game. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=187389&>, K OAK - The Guzzlers Updated 01/07/02
Janikowski missed Sunday's game against the N.Y. Jets due to a bout with cellulitis in his foot. Brad Daluiso kicked in his absence, and missed one field goal and an extra point. Janikowski will be re-evaluated this week, and should be available for Oakland's opening-round playoff game, barring any setbacks. 

Amani Toomer <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1262&>, WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 01/07/02
Toomer suffered a concussion during Sunday's 34-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers. The injury isn't considered too serious. Toomer finished the game with five receptions for 79 yards, giving him 72 catches for 1,054 yards and five touchdowns on the year. 

Terry Glenn <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1254&>, WR NE - The Fat Bastards Updated 01/07/02
Glenn was inactive for Sunday's game against Carolina, and didn't make the trip to Charlotte with the team. According to the Boston Globe, there was much speculation as to why Glenn didn't play. One report indicated New England has already decided not to play him in the playoffs, and another said Glenn had missed meetings. Glenn did have an excused absence Wednesday, when he had to attend to a personal matter. 

Joe Horn <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1511&>, WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 01/07/02
Horn left Sunday's game against San Francisco in the third quarter with a sprained left knee and did not return. He caught three passes for 44 yards before suffering the injury, and finished the season with 83 catches for 1,265 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns. 

Cris Carter <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1248&>, WR MIN - The Executioners Updated 01/07/02
Carter (ribs) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Baltimore. It is still uncertain whether or not Carter will play, so Jake Reed could see some extended playing time. In any event, the game will likely be Carter's last in a Minnesota Vikings' uniform. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=12400&>, TE KC - The Executioners Updated 01/07/02
Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. ""Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury,"" General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. ""The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look."" Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season.! F! urther tests are expected to be taken this week. 

Mike Hollis <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1387&>, K JAC - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 01/07/02

According to the Denver Post , Davis expects to return to Denver for the 2002 season. ""I expect to be back, unless you know something I don't know,"" Davis said. ""I want to be here. I think we'll find a happy medium for both sides. It will be a win-win situation, I believe."" Davis is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent.

Jason Elam <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=3756&key=1383&>, K DEN - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/07/02

"With over 440 new tax laws, will you be ready?","Valued customer:

This year is quickly coming to a close and tax season is just
around the corner. You may have received the initial impact of
the new tax laws with the rebate checks mailed earlier this year.
But will you be able to take advantage of all of the new
opportunities? We can help.

These tax law changes are the most extensive in decades -
including new tax brackets, marriage penalty relief, education
incentives, and retirement savings. Our tax professionals have
created a comprehensive analysis that explains exactly how
taxpayers will benefit from the new tax laws. Simply click here
to learn more about how the tax laws affect you:

"[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Emmitt Smith to Play ""Majority of Game""","Entire story:
http://cbs.sportsline.com/u/wire/stories/0,1169,4534966_59,00.html


IRVING, Texas (AP) Emmitt Smith will return to the Dallas Cowboys' lineup
Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right
knee.

Coach Dave Campo said after practice Friday that Smith would ""be ready to
play the majority of the game.""

Smith returned to practice Thursday and was back on the field Friday. He was
hurt during the Cowboys' 17-3 win over Arizona on Oct. 28 when he was
tackled after a 1-yard gain in the final two minutes.

Smith, the NFL's second-leading career rusher, did not speak with reporters.

Before missing consecutive games for the first time in his 12-year NFL
career, Smith had missed only two other games because of injury - one in
1994 and another five years later.

Smith has 15,564 career yards rushing, 1,162 behind Walter Payton's NFL
record.

Troy Hambrick, who rushed for 204 yards while replacing Smith in losses to
the New York Giants and Atlanta, will start at fullback.


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


Doesn't make a lot of sense to me with Hambrick playing the way he does but
far be it from me to try and figure out Jerry Jones.   Emmitt has paid the
dues and has earned the start I suppose when he's healthy.   Bottom line is
put a heavy downgrade on Hambrick for now.

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

"[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Jason Brookins OUT","From CBS Sportsline:   Brookins may miss the rest of the season with a
broken foot. Moe Williams will probably become Baltimore's No. 1 RB now, and
the Ravens may add another RB to their roster in the next few days.


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


Don't expect something goofy like a Barry Sanders or Robert Smith to come to
the rescue.   I'd expect to see Moe Williams and FB Obafemi Ayanbadejo
should have an increased role.   I expected good things from Williams when
Brian Billick acquired him and had been disappointed he hadn't seen much
action.   Now he has a golden opportunity.   Also remember Terry Allen will
be back from the hand injury (latest word is week 14) so don't go crazy.

Thanks to Footballguy Rich Voakes for pointing me to this one.

"[Footballguys] Update # 159 11-20  Week 11 Rushing Matchups","

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Hi Folks,

I know many of you have early deadlines this week so I juggled my schedule
to get these early.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly
where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive
emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but
listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup
may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start
the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup
one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk,
Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.   The matchup info is
meant to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between
players.

Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.
http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position
numbers are from ESPN.com.
Let's get to it.

Joe

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the
Offense.


Atlanta's Maurice Smith vs Carolina Defense

Smith was upstaged last week by big Bob Christian who looked great on the TD
pass reception and run.   Smith had 43 yards on 19 carries (2.3 ypc)  Keep
an eye on his health as he was nicked in Sunday's game.   Smith has been up
and down but facing this Carolina defense may be what he needs.   The
Panthers are ranked # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4
weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   If you've been thinking
about starting Smith, this could be the week.


Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Detroit Defense

Ahman Green was semi quiet running the ball against Atlanta last week
carring 17 times for 62 yards (3.6 ypc)   He'll face a soft defense this
week against the Lions.   Detroit ranks # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last 4 weeks and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.
Green's a sure starter here.


San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Arizona Defense

Everyone keeps talking about the ""rookie wall"" and Tomlinson just keeps
plugging.   Sunday, he posted 68 yards on 22 carries (3.1 ypc) plus a TD.
Not bad.   This week, he faces the soft Cardinal defense that ranks # 23 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 28 for the year
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   If Tomlinson's been your guy, I'd
certainly start him again here.


Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs Kansas City Defense

Alexander continues to have a bulldog like hold on the starting RB job.
Coach Mike Holmgren is now softening his stance on Ricky Watters' return
saying Watters might be the 3rd down back when he returns.   But even that
seems to be a couple of weeks away.   Alexander is the man.   He'll face a
Chief defense that ranks # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks.   Alexander has to be licking his chops though at their # 31
ranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble
stopping the Offense.


Baltimore's Jason Brookins vs Jacksonville Defense

Brookins did a nice job last week against Cleveland carrying the ball 21
times for 89 yards (4.2 ypc)   I'd expect him to improve each week as he
gets more comfortable in the role of #1 RB.   He didn't catch any passes so
that's a little bit of a worry.   This week, he faces a Jacksonville Defense
that did a pretty good against Jerome Bettis last week.   They rank # 21 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 11 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.   Watch very closely how the team and self appointed
spokesman Shannon Sharpe handle the Elvis Grbac 4 interceptions thing.
Could lead to a more conservative gameplan with a focus on running the ball
more.


Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Cleveland Defense

Corey Dillon showed last week why he gets saddled with the inconsistency
rep.   17 carries for 38 yards (2.2 ypc) won't carry your team.   The sad
thing is he's so hard to predict when he'll break out.   This week, he faces
a Cleveland Defense that's ranked # 28 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last 4 weeks so you'd have to think he has a chance.   The Browns
rank # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs as well.


Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Minnesota Defense

Thomas didn't make much noise last week with just 58 yards on 23 carries
(2.5 ypc)   Fantasy owners are trying to decide who the real Thomas is.
This week, he'll face a soft Viking defense that ranks # 30 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.   I think we'll see him get back on track.   The Bear passing game will
definitely open up some lanes for him.


Miami's Lamar Smith vs Buffalo Defense

The Lamar Smith woes continue.   He showed glimpses of breaking out but
wound up with 53 yards on 19 carries (2.8 ypc)   I'm not as worried about
Travis Minor stealing too much from him as he only managed 9 yards on 6
carries (1.5 ypc)   This Miami running game has faded quickly.   They'll
face a soft Buffalo defense this week that ranks # 22 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.


New York's Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Oakland Defense

Barber looked very good Monday while Dayne was awful.   Barber rushed 8
times for 55 yards plus he caught 4 passes for 52 yards.   Dayne, on the
other hand, rushed 4 times for a whopping minus 3 ypc.   (NEGATIVE 0.8 ypc)
The Raider defense isn't much ranking # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last 4 weeks and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so this is
probably a good matchup.   At least for Barber.   I'd start Dayne at your
own risk until he shows me something.


New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs New England Defense

Start Ricky Williams.   He's rolling.  120 yards on 28 carries (4.3 ypc)
plus another 48 receiving.   The re-emergence of QB Aaron Brooks is a huge
factor and Ricky should keep it up.   New England ranks # 10 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks but I wouldn't let that deter
me at all.


San Francisco's Garrison Hearst / Kevan Barlow vs Indianapolis Defense

Hearst continued the miracle story with another fine outing last week.   He
had 92 yards on 17 carries plus he caught 6 passes for 21 yards.   He looks
to be too much for Kevan Barlow to overtake at this point.   Barlow did have
7 carries but it looks pretty clear that Hearst is the guy.  The Colt
defense ranks # 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.
For the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Tampa Bay Defense

You don't need me to tell you to start Faulk.   Just do it and count your
blessings that you own one of the best players in the universe.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Arizona's Michael Pittman vs San Diego Defense

Pittman ran pretty hard last week gaining 81 yards on 23 carries (3.5 ypc)
but yielded a TD to Thomas Jones last week.   That's not good.   This
Charger defense is definitely one that can be run on as they rank # 24 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They don't give up
many points though as evidenced by their # 8 ranking for the year in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.   The Arizona offense was clicking last week (albeit
against Detroit) but it's a little unclear as to exactly how Pittman fits
in.


Carolina's Richard Huntley vs Atlanta Defense

Huntley was much more involved this past week and showed his owners some
signs of life.   He rushed 13 times for 63 yards (4.8 ypc) and also caught 5
passes.   Encouraging signs.   This week he faces a Falcon defense that
could be primed for a letdown after the big Green Bay win.   They rank # 25
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 15 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.


Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs Denver Defense

Emmitt actually looked pretty good last week returning from injury to post
80 yards on 15 carries (5.3 ypc)   He was nicked late in the game so check
his status this week but he looks like he'll be ok for Thursday's game.
The Broncos rank # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4
weeks but are still pretty strong for the year ranking # 9 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.


Denver's Mike Anderson vs Dallas Defense

Anderson posted a whopping 31 yards on 13 carries (2.4 ypc) against the
Redskins last week.   Olandis Gary didn't do any better with 28 yards on 10
carries (2.8 ypc)   At this point, you'd have to say the entire Bronco
offense is in disarray.   WR Rod Smith's injury is a huge factor as they're
simply not the same with him less than 100%.   This week, they face a pretty
good defense in Dallas that ranks # 14 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.   Being a short week will not help matters.


Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs San Francisco Defense

Dominic Rhodes didn't make anyone forget about Edgerrin James but he did
prove what we all were thinking - Being the # 1 RB for Indy is not a bad
thing.   He got the score and also rolled up 67 yards on 18 carries.   And
he'll likely improve.   Not bad for a guy who probably wasn't drafted in
your league.   The 49er defense is average ranking # 18 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   For the year, they rank # 20 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Seattle Defense

After a bye week of rest, Holmes will see how he fares against the Seahawk
defense.   Seattle ranks # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   They're nothing
special but they do a nice job of shutting down Travis Henry and Buffalo
last week.


Oakland's Charlie Garner / Tyrone Wheatley vs New York Giants Defense

Everyone (including me) hoped that Charlie Garner would take advantage of
the opportunity with Wheatley out to show he could be a full time # 1 RB.
Just didn't happen.   Now Wheatley is reportedly back and ready to go and
Garner looks to keep running it between the 20s while Wheatley or Zack
Crockett punch it in at the goalline.   Garner still puts the yards up
though.   Sunday, he rushed for 59 yards and caught another 41.   The Giants
defense ranks # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks
and showed last night they can be vulnerable.


Washington's Stephen Davis vs Philadelphia Defense

Stephen Davis continues to roll up the yards.   Last week, he totaled 84
yards on 23 carries (3.7 ypc)   This week, he faces a decent Eagle defense
that ranks # 17 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and
# 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Tony Banks will likely be back at
QB although Kent Graham did fine.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble
for the Offense.


Buffalo's Travis Henry / Larry Centers vs Miami Defense

Travis Henry looked pretty bad last week.  13 carries for 29 yards (2.2 ypc)
just isn't going to cut it for you.   Throwing 2 fumbles on top of that
could put his playing time in jeopardy.  Sammy Morris and Shawn Bryson are
champing at the bit.   Don't forget about Larry Centers.   He had 66 yards
receiving on 8 passes Sunday and those are likely valuable stats in your
league.   The Dolphin Defense ranks # 7 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last 4 weeks so it'll be no cakewalk.


Cleveland's James Jackson / Ben Gay vs Cincinnati Defense

Jackson was a late scratch from Sunday's game and Ben Gay made the most of
his opportunity.   You gotta love this guy.   He's a very hard runner and
while raw, displayed some nice talent.   I'm guessing Gay's play will be the
best ""rehab"" Jackson could ever receive.   Jackson is reportedly ready to go
against Cincinnati this week.   The Bengals are pretty tough against the run
ranking # 11.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs.


New England's Antowain Smith vs New Orleans Defense

Smith struggled against the Rams Sunday night with 36 yards on 15 carries
(2.4 ypc)   I'd expect tough going again this week against the Saints that
rank # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and # 13
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   New England seems to be coming back to
earth a bit and you know the Tom Brady / Drew Bledsoe thing has to be a
distraction for the team.


Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs Washington Defense

Any worries Duce Staley owners had about Correll Buckhalter stealing time
went up in smoke last week. (sorry)   Staley looked like the Duce of old
rolling up 102 yards on 26 carries.   He threw in 4 receptions for 31 yards
to boot.   Washington is surprisingly tough against the run ranking # 4 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   It won't be a
cakewalk but still you have to like Staley with the way they're playing now.


Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis vs Tennessee Defense

Bettis was held very much in check last week with the exception of one 40
yard run.   Even with the big run, his totals of 52 yards on 21 carries (2.5
ypc) weren't much.   Won't be much easier this week against a good Tennesee
defense that ranks # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4
weeks.   The Titans shut down Corey Dillon last week who has a similar power
style.   I'd have a hard time not starting Bettis though as he's definitely
the focus of this offense and getting better as QB Kordell Stewart continues
to improve.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major
problems for the Offense.


Detroit's James Stewart / Lamont Warren / Corey Schlesinger vs Green Bay
Defense

Talk about a muddy situation.   Last week, Lamont Warren, Corey Schlesinger,
and Rueben Droughns each had at least 6 carries.   And just for good
measure, James Stewart is reportedly ready to play this week.   Throw in the
added bonus that Green Bay is very tough and ranked # 3 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   That's enough to make me shy away
from all these guys.   (That and the fact Charlie Batch may throw it 75
times...)


Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Baltimore Defense

As we told our readers today, the news isn't good for Fred Taylor.   His doc
is telling him to stay out of the lineup for this week and they're sounding
way too vague for my liking as to when he'll be back.   That probably means
Mack gets the call by default.   He posted a stellar 6 yard on 8 rushes (0.8
ypc) day.   Yes, ZERO point 8.   Elvis Joseph can run back kicks but he only
managed 6 yards on his 3 carries.   And QB Mark Brunell could miss the game
with his leg injury.   All in all, pretty ugly going against the Ravens
Defense who's fallen down to # 12 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last 4 weeks but is still nasty.


Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Chicago Defense

Bennett got the carries Monday night while Doug Chapman saw no action.
Bennett had 33 yards on 11 carries (3.3 ypc) so you'd have to think he's on
the right track back.   When Culpepper, Moss and Carter play like they did
Monday, it's pretty clear the Vikings won't need a lot from their RB.   This
week he'll face a much tougher opponent in Chicago.   The Bears rank # 5 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks and are playing very
well.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs so
it'll be a tough matchup coming off a short week.


Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs St. Louis Defense

Dunn and Alstott put up pitiful numbers Sunday.   Dunn had 12 yards on 8
carries (1.5 ypc)   Alstott had 2 yards on 4 carries (0.5 ypc) although he
did get a score.   Granted, it was against a tough Chicago team but that's
awful.   This week, they'll face an injury riddled St. Louis team that ranks
# 2 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   Even with the
injuries, I don't like either of these RBs here.


Tennessee's Eddie George vs Pittsburgh Defense

It's bad when the QB out rushes the # 1 RB but that's what happened last
week.   George put up 61 yards on 23 carries (2.7 ypc) and seemed to take a
step back.   The trouble with him is that his game is so power oriented,
that when the holes aren't there, he simply can't do much.   This week,
it'll be much tougher against the swarming Steeler defense ranked # 1 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last 4 weeks.   They rank # 3 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'm not one for benching your best players
but this is one matchup you'll want to look at very closely.



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


That'll do it for the Rushing Matchups.   Passing Matchups to follow.

Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game.""

"RE: Jason' Bachelor Party","
OK the final plans have been made for the bachelor party.  We will meet at 5 pm SHARP at Cinemark Theaters on Richmond and Sam Houston Parkway (Beltway 8).  This is the movie theater across the street from Jason's apartment.  You need to be there on time so that we can make the cruise.

Let me know if you have questions.

I have made reservations for Jason's Bachelor Party.  You are the chosen few.  The cruise is set for Sat. Jan 19 at 7 pm out of Freeport.  Transportation will be arranged for you.  We need to leave at about 5 pm on the 19th.  I will arrange a meeting place and relay it to you in a future e-mail.  The final tally will be $32 a person. I have paid for this already so you can reimburse me on the 19th and I can promptly blow all of that money on gambling.  Sadly, the gourmet dinner was not available on the Freeport cruise so we will have to suffer through a buffet dinner.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: Jason' Bachelor Party


The time has finally come for us to mourn the loss of another one of our
fallen brethren.  Yes Jason Bass, my brother, will be getting married
Feb. 2.  So, with that in mind it is time to set up the festivities for
the bachelor party. 

The party will be Saturday, Jan. 19.  I was thinking about taking the
gambling/drinking cruise out of Freeport (about 30 mins south of
Houston) called The Texas Treasure (www.txtreasure.com).  The cost
should run about $50 a person for the cruise - drinks and ""gourmet""
dinner included or $35/person for drinks and buffet dinner.  Let me know
which one you would prefer.  I personally prefer the better dinner.
Gambling expenses are not included in the above calculations.

The cruise sails from 7PM - 1AM.

Let me know if you can make it and, if so, what choice of dinner you
would like ASAP so I can make arrangements.

-Eric

"Rockets Host Kings Tonight","Dear eric,




ROCKETS LOOK TO MOVE BACK OVER .500

The Rockets return to Compaq Center tonight for the first time since dismantling the Dallas Mavericks on Nov. 17 to host hot-shooting Peja Stojakovic and the Sacramento Kings. 

Houston will have revenge on its mind against the Kings, who defeated the Rockets 113-77 on Nov. 19. Steve Francis will miss tonight's game to rest a sore foot which caused him to miss Friday's game in Seattle and leave early during Sunday's contest against the Clippers. But Moochie Norris is ready to step in and help the Rockets avenge last week's loss. 

Be sure to log on to rockets.com(http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=137036&UID=45456540&MID=190523)later this afternoon to check out our Game Preview section, including video interviews from Rockets players and Head Coach Rudy T. about tonight's game.

ROCKETS 5-GAME OUTLOOK

"Oranges","A girl was a prostitute, but she didn't want her grandma to know.
One day,  the police raided a whole group of prostitutes at a sex
party in a hotel and the girl was among them. The police took them
outside and had all the prostitutes line up along the driveway when
suddenly, the girl's grandma came by and saw her granddaughter.

Grandma asked,""Why are you standing in line here, dear?"" Not
willing to let her grandmother know the truth, the girl told her grand
mother that the policemen were there passing out free oranges
and she was just lining up for some.

""Why, that's awfully nice of them. I think I'll get some for myself,""
and she proceeded to the back of the line.

A policeman was going down the line asking for information from
all of the prostitutes. When he got to Grandma, he was bewildered
and explained, ""Wow, still going at it at your age? How do you do it?""

Grandma replied, ""Oh, it's easy, dear. I just take my dentures out,
pull the skin back and suck them dry.""

OK the final plans have been made for the bachelor party.  We will meet at 5

You need to be there on time so that we can make the cruise.

"End of Season","Eric,

Thanks for running the league.  It was fun.  And
thanks for selecting Boumann as your QB in the first
round of the playoffs.  And tell P-Love that I
appreciated him leaving Warner for me at the 7th pick
in the draft.

Anyway, since I no longer work in the Enron building,
it would probably be easiest to drop a check in the
mail:

Reagan Mathews
17210 Canyon Stream Ct.
Houston, TX  77095

By my calculation the amount should be:
$608.5

(1614-840) x 75% = 580.5 + $28 = $608.5.

$28 comes from...my total costs of -132, plus my paid
amount of 120, plus my winnings of 40. 

The reason I bring this up is that it looks like the
""Finances"" page of the website is double counting the
$50 entry fee.  Anyway, let me know if you have a
different number for the distributions.

-Reagan

"[Footballguys] BREAKING NEWS - Tom Brady to Remain Starter","Entire story:
http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/324/sports/Is_Brady_the_1_+.shtml

Clipped from the Michael Smith article:   FOXBOROUGH - Bill Belichick said
yesterday morning that Tom Brady will start at quarterback Sunday against
New Orleans, then took it a step further in the afternoon, saying Brady will
start Patriots games unless something drastic occurs.

''I think as we move forward here, unless something unforeseen happens that
Tom will be the quarterback, and he'll get the snaps in practice and in the
games,'' Belichick said on the ''Patriots Monday'' show on WWZN 1510.

Yesterday morning Belichick told the media at Foxboro Stadium, ''I don't see
any changes this week. I don't think this is the time to get into a big
personnel evaluation, but I don't see any changes.'' Those comments came
less than 12 hours afte his team's 24-17 loos to the St. Louis Rams.

At the news conference, Belichick was brief with his responses regarding the
quarterback situation, but his comments to Sean McDonough on his weekly
radio show on WWZN gave the indication that Brady will be his starter for
the forseeable future.

That decision likely would not sit well with Drew Bledsoe, a nine-year
veteran and three-time Pro Bowler. Bledsoe sustained a sheared blood vessel
after a fierce hit by New York Jets linebacker Mo Lewis in Week 2, which
opened the way for Brady to start the next eight games. Brady has led the
Patriots to a 5-3 mark.

''Drew hasn't been able to play the last eight weeks ... and Tom's more
game-ready at this point,'' Belichick said on the radio. ''That's the way
we're going to go.''

Belichick reportedly informed the players of his plans last night during the
weekly quarterbacks meeting. Patriots spokesman Stacey James confirmed only
that the meeting had taken place. Normally, it is held on Tuesday night, but
this week's schedule gives the players a day off for Thanksgiving, so it was
moved up.

Attempts to reach Belichick, Brady, and Bledsoe last night were
unsuccessful.

Before this season, Bledsoe signed the largest contract in NFL history,
worth $103 million over 10 years. His compensation for this year alone is
$11.5 million.

Bledsoe was activated for the Rams game - for the first time since his
injury - but watched as Brady threw two costly interceptions before bringing
the Patriots within a touchdown with a 10-yard scoring pass to David Patten
with 7:46 left.

The first interception was a strike to Kevin Faulk early in the first
quarter that bounced off the running back's shoulder pads. Dexter McCleon
was there to make the pick, and the Rams scored the game's first touchdown
three plays later.


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


You Brady owners can rest a little easier as it looks like he could be the
man.   Nothing with Bill Belichick is ever set in stone so I wouldn't get
too comfortable but obviously, this is good news for you Brady folks or
those looking to snag him for the homestretch run.

Thanks to Footballguy Eric Posty for sending this one to me.

Joe

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts will place wide receiver Jerome
Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday.

Team president Bill Polian said Monday night that Pathon will undergo
surgery ``sometime soon'' to repair a damaged ligament in his right foot.

The move will end Pathon's fourth NFL season. The Colts did not announce how
they would fill Pathon's roster spot.

Pathon sprained his right foot near the end of the third game of the season,
a 44-13 loss at New England. He aggravated the injury during warmups before
the Colts played Miami on Nov. 11. Polian said a further examination last
week revealed more damage to the foot.

Pathon earned the starting job opposite two-time Pro Bowl receiver Marvin
Harrison, and was having the best season of his career. He set career highs
for receptions and receiving yards in each of the Colts' first two games,
and was the team's leading receiver through three games.

He missed four games before returning against Miami.

Pathon tried to practice last Wednesday. But Polian said the receiver had a
setback before missing Sunday's game at New Orleans.

Pathon finishes the season with 24 receptions for 330 yards and two
touchdowns.

And the hits just keep on rollin' for Indy.   Terrence Wilkins and Reggie
Wayne should benefit as should TE Marcus Pollard.   Tough break for Pathon
who was having a great start.

Thanks to Footballguy Chuck Bailey for pointing me to this one.

"RE: FFL $$","Hey Eric:

Good to hear from you.  The holidays went very well.  I spent Christmas in
New Orleans with my family. I hadn't seen my parents and brother in a year,
so it was great. I have not found a job yet, but keeping my spirits up.

How were your holidays?  How is it going at Enron?  I understand the trading
group is close to being purchased.  Is that about right?

Please send the check to:

3000 Greendridge, Apt. 1818
Houston, TX  77057

Take care
Harry

Hey Harry,

How are things?  Have you found a job yet?  I trust the holidays went well

Anyways,  I have a check for $74 for FFL - where can I send it?

In a press release, Ken said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.""

"[Footballguys] Update - Todd Bouman to Start","Clipped from the article from Kevin Seifert, Star Tribune

entire article:  http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/915564.html

Vikings quarterback Todd Bouman, declaring that the injured thumb on 
his throwing hand is much better, said today he's ready to go Sunday 
against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

""I took all of the snaps today,'' said Bouman, who has moved up to 
startiang quarterback after Daunte Culpepper injured his knee. ""The 
thumb is a little sore, but I'll be ready to go on Sunday.""

Bouman continued: ""I've come a long way the last couple of days. With 
all of the treatment I have gotten, I can squeeze the ball and I can 
throw pretty much anything I want to throw, so I don't foresee it 
being a problem.""

The St. Cloud State product injured his thumb in the team's 27-24 
loss last Sunday to Detroit. 

Bouman has had limited practice action this week. Backup Spurgeon 
Wynn has taken more snaps the past few days, and the team brought in 
Ramaro Miller, cut in training camp, should he have been needed to 
back up Wynn.

Bouman today called dealing with the injury just ""part of the game. 
You've just got to come in and get treatment, and hopefully things 
will turn around fast. It's progressed each day, and that's all you 
can do.""

He said there's a risk that it could be re-injured Sunday. ""It's not 
going to heal until the season is over. So any time if you get hit on 
it, it's going to re-injure it or aggravate it. But you've just got 
to deal with it.""

Concerning Culpepper's surgery, Green said today that it ""went as 
expected ... and he has a positive prognosis. Daunte's rehabilitation 
will begin immediately.""

While there's be no definitive word on when Culpepper might return to 
the lineup, he could end up missing the season's remaining three 
games. The consequence of that appears minimal, considering the 
Vikings are virtually eliminated from a playoff berth.

****************************

Our View:  With Todd taking all the snaps on Thursday, he is a very 
safe bet to start on Sunday.  Culpepper is not expected to return 
this season so Todd should start the remainder of the season unless 
he is injured further.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Since you never gave me the $20 for the last time we bet on CU/Texas, I figured I would give you the chance to go double or nothing on the second round.  I think the line is Texas -9.  Let me know.

"[Footballguys] Update - Jeff Garcia Throws - Still Questionable","Entire story:

Garcia Throws, but Still Questionable

BY DENNIS GEORGATOS
Mercury News

Quarterback Jeff Garcia tested his sore ribs Thursday, briefly running plays
and passing during the 49ers' team drills on a rain-soaked practice field.

Backup Tim Rattay still handled the bulk of the practice snaps and Garcia
remains questionable for Saturday's game at 3Com Park against the
Philadelphia Eagles.

Coach Steve Mariucci said he was encouraged by Garcia's outing but the
quarterback's playing status could be a game-time decision.

``I didn't notice any wincing. I didn't see any grimacing,'' Mariucci said.
``I saw him throw a couple of frozen ropes in there. We didn't overdo it
with him. We'll see. I don't know what to predict but he's making some
progress. The important thing will be how it feels'' today.

Garcia, who has started the past 34 games for the 49ers, tore rib-cage
cartilage when he was tackled Sunday during a 21-0 victory over the Miami
Dolphins.

``I felt pretty good in throwing the ball in our 7-on-7 period,'' Garcia
said. ``I didn't want to make it any worse. But I was able to practice and
felt good about that. I felt crisp and I felt sharp. And it made me more
confident as far as going into Saturday.''

If Garcia is unable to play, Rattay would make his first NFL start. Rattay
has thrown one pass in his two-year NFL career.

If Rattay does start because of Garcia's injury, Rick Mirer could be his
backup. Garcia still could be available in an emergency as the third
quarterback.

************* Our View **************

Another sketchy call here.  It's encouraging news but still a game time
decision.   It's pretty much the same advice as with Steve McNair:  If you
have a good backup, I'd go there.   Garcia could play, but there is
definitely the chance he sits and you probably can't risk a zero from your
QB.

More if we hear it.   Thanks to Footballguy Bob Albright, Jr for pointing me
to this one.

Joe

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

"[Footballguys] Update #196 - Players in the News","Some of you are still alive and playing in your Championship this 
week.  Some of you completed their seasons last week or before.  For 
those still alive, here is the news that you need to know:

General News:

Tampa Bay is expected to rest a lot of players in this game.  They do 
not need the game and will likely sit Warrick Dunn.  Brad Johnson and 
Keyshawn Johnson may play only a half.  Doug Brien will also give 
Martin Gramatica another week to heal.  

Pittsburgh will likely rest some of their players this week  Jerome 
Bettis could start, but probably will not.  Hines Ward and Kordell 
Stewart may only play a half.  Don't expect Kordell to take off
on many runs this week either.

Philadelphia is expected to rest the majority of their stars.  Chad 
Lewis and James Thrash are not expected to play.  Duce Staley may 
play.  Donovan McNabb is likely to only to play a half.

The Rams will either be full throttle or resting their stars.  If 
Chicago wins, expect Warner and Faulk to be huge.  If Chicago loses, 
both could be spelled this week.

And now onto the individual players:


Quarterbacks in the News:

Chris Chandler (Atl) missed practice on Friday and isn't expected
to play.  He appears on the injury report as doubtful with a sore 
elbow.  Michael Vick will start in his place.

Alex Van Pelt (Buf) was signed to a five-year contract extension.

Rob Johnson (Buf), who was just inched out of a Pro-Bowl selection, 
will not play this week.  He is out with broken clavicle.

Tim Couch (Cle) was signed for another 4 years by the Browns. 

Ty Detmer (Det) is expected to start for the injured Mike McMahon.

week's contest.  The team will also be resting RB Duce Staley and

look for Lamont Warren to start.

game.  He appears on the injury report as doubtful with turf toe.

ankle.

Tony Martin (Atl) was released by the Falcons this week.  Shawn

questionable with a bruised face.  Chris Chambers is probable with an 
ankle injury.  

Cris Carter (Min) has missed practice all week with a cracked rib.  
He is very questionable to play and will likely be a gametime 
decision.  If he cannot go, Jake Reed will start opposite of Randy 
Moss.

Randy Moss (Min) hasn't done anything stupid this week?yet.

Terry Glenn (NE) was given Wednesday off for personal reasons.  I am 
guessing he needs a lot more days off.  Glenn practiced on Thursday 
and will play as the #3 WR this week.

Jerry Rice (Oak) is away from the team to be with his ailing father.  
It is unclear whether he will make it to the game on Sunday.  If he

Koren Robinson (Sea) has been benched in favor of James Williams.  
James will start opposite of Darrell Jackson this week.

expected to play.  

Michael Westbrook (Was) was unable to practice on Thursday and may 
not be able to go on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore ankle. Kevin Lockett would start in his 
place if he cannot go.

Greg Clark (SF) is out again this week.  He also is not expected to 
play in the playoffs either.

game means little to the Bucs.

Frank Wycheck (Ten) missed Thursday's practice, but is still
expected to start on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as 
questionable with a thigh bruise.  


***************************************************

"Gas Contract","Gentlemen,

Please nominate 65,000 MMbtu of gas into the TXU Lone Star Gas pipeline for
the account of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics in Fort Worth for the month of
January, 2002.

Enron has a master agreement with Lockheed Martin (Agreement CA 1135).  On
November 8, 2001, Enron executed a 12-month confirmation to deliver gas to
the Lone Star Pipeline for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics in Fort Worth.

The agreed upon date for the January 2002 nomination was five days prior to
the beginning of the month.  That date has passed, but Lone Star has
indicated that it will accept a nomination if received by Friday, January 4,
2002.

Please make the nomination.

Also, if you will, please call to let me know that it was made.

I appreciate your help in what must be a most frustrating time for you.

Thanks,

Ed Fore
Facilities Engineer

Grbac has been inconsistent at times this season but should still be an adequate starter during the Fantasy playoffs. Expect him throw for at least 200 yards and a touchdown. <BR>
</FONT><BR>

Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season. He will have some good outings, even though the Colts are not in the playoff race. <BR>

Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17. <BR>

Davis (knee) is listed as probable for Sunday's game. You should have no reservations about starting him against the Chiefs. <BR>

According to published reports, Allen will split carries with Anthony Thomas on Sunday against Green Bay. Thomas is expected to start, but Allen will spell the rookie during the game. <BR>

Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual. <BR>

Robinson's prognosis for recovery from surgery to repair two ligaments in his left knee is seven to nine months. That would put him on target to return around the start of training camp next season, but you should check back on his status during the summer.<BR>

Defensive back Bryant Westbrook has been listed as out for Sunday's game against Tennessee. This could mean big things for Steve McNair and the Titans' passing game, who should have an easy time beating Detroit's corners on a regular basis. <BR>

Morris, who is recovering from knee surgery, was not placed on injured reserve by the Chiefs. There is a chance he might be activated late in the year, but it is doubtful that he will help Fantasy leaguers this season.<BR>
</FONT><BR>

Anders, a three-time Pro Bowler, was released by the Kansas City Chiefs Friday. Anders, who had spent his entire 10-year career with the Chiefs, never recorded more than 400 rushing yards in a single season but went to the Pro Bowl as a fullback for his blocking and receiving. <BR>

Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble.

"[Footballguys] Breaking News - Fred Taylor Told to Stay Out Of Lineup","Entire story:
http://www.sportsline.com/u/ce/multi/0,1329,4560008_59,00.html

Clipped from the Jay Glazer article on CBS Sportsline:

One week after Miami-based specialist Dr. John Uribe recommended that Colts'
running back Edgerrin James undergo season-ending knee surgery, the doctor
recommended that another star back is not yet ready to return to action.

SportsLine.com has learned that Jaguars running back Fred Taylor met with
the specialist Tuesday morning and was told that his injured groin is still
not healed. Taylor has been practicing the past three weeks and the Jaguars
had hoped he would have been back in the lineup already. However, he has
been unable to run full speed and now comes word that he will continue be
sidelined.

""Dr. Uribe said he has a major injury and that after eight weeks, it's still
not healed and is going to take some more time getting healthy,"" Taylor's
agent Drew Rosenhaus said. ""He wasn't sure specifically how much time Fred
would miss but it's a major tear, he tore the groin muscle off the bone. Dr.
Uribe said this is the type of injury that could often take a minimum of
three months before it is healed.""

Taylor injured the groin in the first half of the team's second game of the
year. He made a cut in the middle of the field and suddenly stopped, let go
of the ball and dropped.

""It's going to be very unfair for anyone to assume he will play any time in
the immediate future,"" said Rosenhaus. ""He's just not healthy yet. He can't
run full speed without tremendous pain. The Jaguars have done a very good
job in working him but he's still in pain.

""It's not just the groin but he also has pain in the hip now, which is an
off-shoot of the groin. But he's still healing and he shouldn't play at this
time and when the Jaguars talk to him later today, I'm sure they'll have the
same feeling.""

In Taylor's absence, the Jaguars have played musical chairs in the
backfield. Stacey Mack has been the primary replacement, but youngsters
Frank Moreau and Elvis Joseph have also been given shots. Mack started
Sunday's game and will likely remain with the first team in the immediate
future.

""He's doing everything he can to get back in as soon as possible,"" said the
Florida-based agent. ""Remember, we entered the season primed to play and
receive a big contract extension so nobody wants in there more than Fred.

""But the doctor recommends that he is progressing at a good pace and it
depends on how the injury heals. He said he has seen guys miss an entire
season with this. But at the same time, it's such a vague injury. Fred may
wake up next week and suddenly feel great. At the same time, it could take
several weeks. We don't know. We only know he's healing but shouldn't play
at this time.""


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


This makes sense as the Jaguars have been very vague about Taylor's health.
Clearly, bad news for Taylor owners.   Stacey Mack and Elvis Joseph get an
extension but they've come up pretty small so far.   As Dr. Coshal, our
Footballguys.com Team Doc mentioned way back when Taylor was injured, this
is a serious deal.   Stay tuned but for now it's not looking good.

Thanks to Footballguy Jeff White for pointing me to this one.

Joe

"DELICACY."," 
 
Nice to know that the animal does not ALWAYS lose.
 
 

 
Subject:  DELICACY.

 
An Arizona cowboy stopped at a local restaurant 
following a day of drinking and roaming around in 
Mexico. While sipping his tequila, he noticed a 
sizzling, scrumptious looking platter being served at 
the next table. Not only did it look good, the smell was wonderful. 
 
He asked the waiter, ""What is that you just served?"" 
The waiter replied, ""Ah senor, you have excellent taste! deese are bull's testicles from de bull 
fight this morning. A delicacy!"" 
 
The cowboy, though momentarily daunted, said, ""What the heck, I'm on vacation down here! Bring me an order!"" 
 
The waiter replied, ""I am so sorry senor. Dere is only one serving per day because dere is only one bull fight each morning. If you come early tomorrow and place your order, we will be sure to save you these delicacy!"" 
 
The next morning, the cowboy returned, placed his order, and then that evening he was served the one and only special delicacy of the day. After a few bites, and inspecting the contents of his platter, he called to the waiter and said, ""These are delicious, but >my portion is much, much smaller than the one I saw you serve yesterday!"" 
 
The waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, ""Si, Senor. Sometimes de bull, he wins.""

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

"Bluegrass & Spring Bock","Dear St. Arnold's Army: 

Beer! Banjos! Bock! Bluegrass!   
If you love bluegrass, the Grateful Dead, or both, this is the event for you.  If you loved the soundtrack to ""Deliverance"" but could do without the ""Squeal like a pig"", this is the event for you.  If you look forward to the rollout of Spring Bock every year, this is the event for you.  If you like yummy Tex-Mex, this is the event for you. 

This Friday night, January 18 at the Garden in the Heights, the Yonder Mountain String Band will be performing (inside the Beer Hall in all likelihood).  This band takes bluegrass to a new level and has been known to jam on one song for an hour.  They just sold out the Fillmore in San Francisco (the Mecca of Bluegrass - OK, perhaps not, but they do like good music there) two nights in a row.  Come out and join us (overalls not necessary).  This email is good for $2 off the admission ticket. 

When: Friday, January 18 
Time: 6:30  Doors open 
      7:00  Billy Bright Band (opening act) 
      9:00  Yonder Mountain String Band (they're doing 2 sets - you'll get your moneys' worth) 
Where: Garden in the Heights, 3926 Feagan 
Admission: $10 with this email, otherwise $12 at the door 
Food: Tex-Mex available, catered by a fine restaurant (where the Yonder Mountain String Band played their Last Concert) 

Last Chance on Cigar Night 
We have just a few spaces left.  Here's the info.  For reservations, please call the brewery or email dan@saintarnold.com.   

Admission: $20 (includes the two cigars)  
Date: Wednesday, January 23 
Time: 6 pm - 9 pm  
Where: Saint Arnold Brewery 
       2522 Fairway Park Dr. 


If anyone was supposed to receive his/her Hopwaiian shirt and has not, please let us know.  It's the ultimate beer fashion accessory!  Christian Dior wants to license the design from us for their show in Milan. 

Also, please forward this to any friends on AOL, because AOL blocks our email missives (even though we don't spam).  Anyone with connections to AOL that can get us past this hurdle, please let us know!  Thanks for your support!  

Cheers,

"[Footballguys] Breaking News - Jimmy Smith Troubles","Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1126/1284614.html


JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Jacksonville Jaguars receiver Jimmy Smith tested
positive for cocaine after police stopped him Nov. 11 on suspicion of
drunken driving, but he will not be prosecuted.

Smith could face disciplinary action from the NFL for violating the league's
substance abuse policy.

NFL spokesman Dan Masonson said the league was reviewing Smith's case.

Smith denied having taken cocaine, and said he was trying to figure out how
the test could have returned positive.

""I've never done it, don't do it and don't plan to do it,"" Smith said. ""I
just hate for my name to be associated with anything like that, ever. Since
I've been here, I've been a good role model, and I will continue to be a
good role model. It's devastating to me and my family, but life goes on.""

Coach Tom Coughlin said Smith told him he did not take cocaine.

""This is a person I've had a long relationship with,"" Coughlin said. ""He
looks me in the eye and tells me he didn't do it, I'm going to believe it.""

Smith passed two breath tests after he was stopped, but police took a urine
sample, which was sent to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for
analysis.

Smith tested positive for cocaine, Assistant State Attorney John Guy said
Monday.

Guy said his office would not prosecute Smith for drunken driving because he
did not have a blood-alcohol level above the state's .08 limit. Smith also
will not be prosecuted on drug charges.

""He didn't have anything on his person when he was arrested,"" Guy said.
""There was only cocaine in his system, and for that I can't prosecute.""

Smith, who has been to the last four Pro Bowls, was third in the AFC in
receptions with 70 this season -- one in which most people didn't think he
would play.

He had three abdominal operations in the off-season, lost about 20 pounds
and spent about a month in the hospital.

This is something that's been rumored for the last few days and looks like
the rumors had some merit behind them.   You'll have to wait to see how it
shakes out.   Tough news all the way around but it's still very unclear what
(if any) action the league will take.   More as we hear it.

However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=235174&""><B>Chris Weinke</B></A>, QB CAR - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>

He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1436&key=133448&""><B>Ricky Williams</B></A>

Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble.

took the two-time defending NBA champion L.A. Lakers to the wire before falling on Thursday.

He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last two games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2125&key=187741&""><B>Tom Brady</B></A>, QB NE - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady might have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2125&key=15&""><B> Dolphins</B></A>, DT MIA - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the season due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's absence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.</FONT></FONT!

He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2125&key=1032&""><B>Mark Brunell</B></A>, QB JAC - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Brunell's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2125&key=12753&""><B>Fred Taylor</B></A>, RB JAC - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of the season, according to the <I>Florida Times-Union</I>. The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain !

 his hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2125&key=1220&""><B>Rod Smith</B></A>, WR DEN - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

He should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2125&key=187741&""><B>Tom Brady</B></A>, QB NE - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/20/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this week,"" coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your !

""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start.

"Fwd: Cave Memo","Subject: cave memo



To: Cave mates
From: Osama
Re: The Cave

Hi guys. We've all been putting in long hours but we've really come  
together  as a group and I love that. Big thanks to Omar for putting up the 
poster  that says, ""There is no I in team"" as well as the  one that says 
""Hang In There, Baby."" That cat is hilarious. However, while  we are 
fighting a  jihad, we can't  forget to take care of the cave. And frankly I 
have a few concerns.

First of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise missiles, we  
should be even  more concerned about the scorpions in our cave. Hey,  you 
don't want to be  stung and neither do I, so we need to sweep the cave  
daily. I've posted a  sign  up sheet near the main cave opening.

Second, it's not often I make a video address but  when I do, I'm trying to  
scare the most powerful country on earth, okay? That  means that while we're 
taping, please do not ride your razor scooters in  the background. Just  
while we're taping. Thanks.

Third point, and this is a touchy one. As you know,  by edict, we're not  
supposed to shave our beards. But I need everyone to just think hygiene,  
especially after mealtime. We're all in this  together.

Fourth: food. I bought a box of Cheez-Its recently,  clearly wrote ""Osama""  
on  the front, and put it on the top shelf. Today, my  Cheez-Its were gone.  
Consideration. That's all I'm saying.

Finally, we've heard that there may be American  soldiers in disguise trying 
  to infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up patrols to  look for them. First 
  patrol will be Omar, Muhammed, Abdul, Akbar, and  Richard.

Love you lots.
Osama

"Bus Pass and Parking Information","
FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

"Re: Jason' Bachelor Party","Hey Eric....sorry for the delay - I sent your brother an e-mail right after
I got this one saying that unfortunately I wasn't going to be able to make
it b/c I just started a new job and unfortunately will only be able to ask
off for the wedding weekend (long enough sentence for you).  Thanks for the
invite and I will definitely make up for the loss at the wedding.  Let me
know if there is anything else I can do - by the way - where are they
registered????  Do you know?

"CBS SPORTSLINE.COM FANTASY FOOTBALL NEWSLETTER","<!--
Please use the web site's ""Contact Us"" link, located at the
bottom of every page, for any inquiries.


Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football 
Newsletter! The newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox 
at the end of every week, and will include news about the 
web site; tips on using all the features available; and 
answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron 
Guru."" 


PLAN FOR THE PLAYOFFS

The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are
on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin
with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, 
with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)

If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, 
Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds 
they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not 
determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. 
The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding 
the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your 
regular season. 

If your team is still in contention, go to 
NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes 
during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be 
available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff 
matchup.


GAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS

Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did
in each game this season. The player's statistics in the 
common categories will be displayed for each game. If you
are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to
see who's been getting the most consistent production.

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 


Mike Blake: I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. 
Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin 
Muhammad in week ten? 

G.G. - Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston 
has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing 
playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from 
a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last 
weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success 
against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with 
Muhammad. 

Russell Brown: My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one 
of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady, 
Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.   

G.G. - Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this 
season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie 
struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and 
won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest 
playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the 
return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in 
his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. 

Chris Gilcrest: Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich 
Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would 
you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, 
Curtis Martin?  

G.G. - Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but 
he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like 
Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar 
performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a 
solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike 
Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the 
matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three 
games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his 
struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit 
is too good to ignore.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay 
healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his 
solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to 
another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best 
Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an 
unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

Question - Chris Gilcrest
</font></b><p><font face=""Arial"" size=""2""> 
<!-- Q3 --> 
Who would you start at QB this weekend: <b>Rich 
Gannon</b> or <b>Kerry Collins</b>? Which one of these four RBs would 
you <i>bench</i>: <b>Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, 
Curtis Martin</b>? 
</font></p><b><font face=""Arial"" size=""2"" color=""#163786""> 
<!-- Q3 answer title --> 
Answer - GG
</font></b><p><p><font face=""Arial"" size=""2""> 
<!-- Q3 answer -->
Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but 
he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like 
Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar 
performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a 
solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike 
Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the 
matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three 
games against <b>Cincinnati</b>, and is worth starting despite his 
struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against <b>Detroit</b> 
is too good to ignore.

"Energy, Weather and Emissions Trading in Europe"," <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/>	 Three trading conferences under one roof...
at the Hotel Okura, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2001	 
 <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/weather/>

Over 70% of European companies
face weather-related risk

Today's business has become all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather derivatives have become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging as utilities, airlines, agriculture have at hand to offset risks associated with temperature and precipitation.

So how do you take advantage of this new market in weather trading that has emerged in Europe? What key issues do you have to be aware of to mitigate your operational and trading risks through weather? Amsterdam will be the place for traders, marketers, exchanges, brokers, and executives powering the weather trading industry to network with each other.

 	 
Speakers at this event will include:

Aquila, Systeia Capital Management, Mirant, LIFFE, Element Re, Entergy-Koch Trading, Risk Management Solutions, Centrica, Utilicorp, weatherXchange, Aon Capital Markets and many more <http://193.128.182.100:8081/ss?click&eyeforenergy&3c459583>...

UBS Warburg estimates that profits
from European power trading alone
will top $2.4 billion in 2002

Add natural gas and oil and you're looking at a huge pot of pure profit, only available to those companies that know how to best take advantage of the rise of deregulation and online trading in the European market. 

Now in its 3rd year, this is THE conference where the European Energy Industry talks about the business of energy trading. Case studies from traders, brokers, online exchanges and energy companies to help you stay at the forefront of the exploding energy trading market.

 	 
Speakers at this event will include:

Dynegy, Altra Energy, OM Group, Powergen, Bergen-Energi, Amsterdam Power Exchange, RWE Trading, ENDESA, The Utilities Exchange, El Paso, SchlumbergerSema, TXU

 <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/emissions/>

""Carbon credits represent a significant asset that companies ignore at their peril""
Jonathan Johns, Ernst & Young

Emission trading options are ripe for the picking - but how can you make sure you're ready to profit from GHG? Let's face it - you really can't afford not to be, especially as the World Bank has estimated demand in the international GHG trading system to be in the order of US$20 billion per annum by 2010.

Eyeforenergy is delighted to bring you this event which will focus on how you can best seize this exciting new market opportunity.

 	 
Speakers at this event will include:

BP, European Commission, Shell, Amerada Hess, Powergen, RMS, Fortum, Natsource, RMC Group, EcoSecurities, Rolls Royce, KfW, Point Carbon, IETA, TransAlta, UK Dept of Environment, and many more <http://193.128.182.100:8081/ss?click&eyeforenergy&3c45bbc4>...

""Congratulations on a successful conference! I found it extremely worthwhile. The structure and content were well-balanced, the organisation tight, the venue first-class and the discussion, both in and out of the conference hall, interesting and valuable.""
Ian French, Frost & Sullivan, Europe

Issue 45 (sample copy) 

 EDITORIAL <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/pics/newsletter/hedit.gif>	
It remains an interesting time for the energy sector... 

In a scenario vaguely reminiscent of the California energy crisis, most of the news focuses around one big story- the continuing Enron saga. There's no lack of stories about the Enron disaster, and each one seems to be more dire than the last. With Congressional probes, security guards posted at Enron's headquarters and the recent sacking of an Andersen partner, it looks like the story's still got a way to play out. You can keep up with all the latest including Al Massey's ongoing articles and interviews at Eyeforenergy. 

We've got a packed briefing for you this week. After focusing the last few editions on the developments surrounding deregulation and energy trading in both the US and Europe, we're taking a closer look at two other issues of interest to the energy community-emissions and weather. Two of the articles below focus on the growing market in emissions trading-the first a look at the market, how it's developing, where the money's to be made, and the second article takes a closer look at the regulations governing the market. We've also got an article on the latest developments in weather trading which seems to be a growing part of many energy traders portfolios and is increasingly popping up on Risk Managers' radar screens. 

All these articles serve as an excellent segue into a few announcements here at Eyeforenergy. Just a quick reminder about the upcoming European Energy, Weather and Emissions Trading conferences in mid-February. We're quickly running out of hotel space, so if you're planning on registering make sure to do it soon before space runs out. Also, we're issuing a call for papers for our upcoming Emissions Trading show in the US... if you'd like to get involved drop our conference Director, Sarah Robinson a line at srobinson@eyeforenergy.com <mailto:srobinson@eyeforenergy.com>.

Emissions Trading: The Emerging Market 
Mention greenhouse gas (GHG) today and you conjure up images of shrinking polar ice caps, rising oceans, depleted rain forests, expanding deserts and even rising crime rates. Although there is still much dissension among the ranks of scientists and environmentalists as to the impact GHG has on the environment, there can be little doubt the earth's climate is predicted to change because human activities are altering the chemical composition of the atmosphere through the buildup of greenhouse gases - primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.

The heat-trapping property of these gases is undisputed. Although uncertainty exists about exactly how earth's climate responds to these gases, global temperatures are rising.

Energy Policy in the U.S. 
They say Washington is a town of give and take. The second session of the 107th Congress will resume later this month, and it is scheduled to take up the nation's energy policy legislation in February. These actions will amend the 1992 Energy Policy Act; renewable energy and climate change sections will probably be debated with significant vigor...

Energy and Weather, an Explosive Combination 
With threats of a new El Ni?o forming in the tropical Pacific, predictions of warmer weather, where it is supposed to be cold and colder weather where it is supposed to warm, a new star is born, the meteorologist. Faced with paper-thin profit margins in a highly competitive market, risk managers have come to rely on meteorologist and weather forecasters as their secret weapon in developing strategies to keep their companies from being held hostage by the weather.

Weather forecasting is something akin to a black art, worthy of Merlin the Magician, for most of today's executives. Few can predict the impact each degree higher or lower than the expected temperature, will have on their company's financial statement. Fewer still have the skills necessary...

Despite the stance of the Bush Administration, state and industry action suggests a growing interest in greenhouse gas trading opportunities in the U.S. 
Expect to see ""Bush"" and ""Kyoto"" back in the headlines as the U.S. Administration prepares to unveil its alternative plan for controlling greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In March 2001, the Bush Administration announced that it would be abandoning the Kyoto Protocol, suggesting that the treaty was ""fatally flawed"" and would harm the U.S. economy.

Despite protest from Europe, Japan, and other proponents of the treaty, the Administration has stuck to its decision. So for those of you that are anxiously anticipating the start of a vibrant, global market in the trade of greenhouse gas emissions, with the largest potential buyer participating...

 NEWS ROUND UP - WEEK IN REVIEW <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/pics/newsletter/hweekin.gif>	
Debate over Global Warming Heating Up 
January 2, 2002--- New Zealand's Business Roundtable has come out against the government ratifying the Kyoto Protocol on climate change while the minister, Pete Hodgson, has given more reasons why it should be done sooner rather than later.

In article just released, Mr Hodgson says New Zealand produces less than 0.2 per cent of world emissions but emissions per person are the fourth highest in the developed world, including large methane emissions from farming. 

Carbon dioxide emissions have increased faster than the population... Click here for Full Story <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/content.asp?nli=energy&nld=1/24/2002&news= 25022> 

Environmentalists Push for GHG Regulations 
January 24, 2002----In what is shaping up t be a last ditch duel, pitting the oil and auto industries against environmental groups, battle lines are being drawn as California seeks to become the first state to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars.

The one-page measure would order the Air Resources Board to lower the amount of carbon dioxide -- one of several greenhouse gases -- spewing from the tailpipes of California's 29 million cars and light trucks. 

If the bill doesn't pass the Assembly before the end of the month, it dies.... Click here for Full Story <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/content.asp?nli=energy&nld=1/24/2002&news= 25019> 

Lay Out at Enron 
January 24, 2002--- In an announcement that was met with surprise by some but inevitable by close observers Kenneth Lay resigned his post as CEO of embattled Enron late yesterday. Defiant in the face of mounting pressures from ex-employees and creditors, Lay said the bankrupt energy trader needs a fresh leader to turn the company around.

Lay, faced widening criminal and political investigations, finally agreed with creditors that the company needed new leadership, if it is to emerge from bankruptcy. 

As more than a dozen regulators and congressional committees line up to take their shots at him, Enron spokesman Vance Meyer... Click here for Full Story <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/content.asp?nli=energy&nld=1/24/2002&news= 25010> 

Australian Companies Face Fines over GHG 
January 23, 2002---New South Wales is set to become the first state to establish compulsory greenhouse emission standards for its power industry. The Premier, Bob Carr, set the wheels in motion with a position paper that aims to end a failed voluntary scheme, under which standards have gone backwards, and replace it with a compulsory one which would fine companies if they did not comply.

The scheme, which could start as early as July, will almost certainly mean increased electricity bills for consumers, although the Government insists the increase will be small. 

Mr Carr will also release a report by the Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal that says power firms have... Click here for Full Story <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/content.asp?nli=energy&nld=1/24/2002&news= 24963> 

U.S. Close to Kyoto Alternative 
January 22, 2002---After receiving mounting criticism for pulling out of the Kyoto Protocol, the United States is close to formulating an alternative plan on global warming that stresses containing greenhouse gas emissions rather than cutting them, sources close to the government said Saturday.

But the initiative to be put forward by the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases is likely to spark further international criticism as it links emission cuts to economic growth rates and fails to require companies to carry out reductions. 

The plan, expected to be announced as early... Click here for Full Story <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/content.asp?nli=energy&nld=1/24/2002&news= 24911> 

Dutch Announce $40 Million CO2 Plan 
January 22, 20022---The Dutch government has inked an three-year $40 million contract with the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) will also provide the Netherlands with credits toward its carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction target laid out in the Kyoto treaty to trim greenhouse gas emissions.

In signing the deal, Environment Ministry spokeswoman Babette Graber said, ""We are now the first country to use state money to buy C02 (credits)."" She added, ""The IFC will identify and select the projects in developing countries.""

Enron's Blame Game Continues; Andersen Points Finger at Company's Business Model 
January 22, 2002---The dot-com meltdown and the Enron debacle are combining to make Sir Walter Scott's old adage ""Oh what a tangled web we weave, When first we practice to deceive,"" a metaphor for the 21st Century. 

Like schoolboys on the playground the Enron saga is full of charges, counter charges, finger pointing and blame. The blame game continued in full force Sunday as the head of Arthur Andersen blamed the energy company's business model as the source of its failure.

"[Footballguys] Breaking News - Trouble for A-Train?","Entire story:
http://chicagosports.com/bears/content/story/0,1984,168218,00.html

Clipped from the John Mullin article:

The Bears are preparing to play one of the NFL's poorest defenses against
the run but may face that defense without their No. 1 running back.

Rookie tailback Anthony Thomas is questionable with a strained hamstring
that has bothered him for the last couple of weeks, got a little worse in
the win over Tampa Bay and could eventually cause coaches to hold him out of
a game to let it heal.

Thomas did not practice Wednesday and his status for Sunday night's game at
Minnesota will not be determined until closer to game time.

""I can't say when I really did it,"" Thomas said. ""It just bothered me a
little more at the end and halftime when you rest on it awhile.""

Injuries are part of every week's preparations and players become accustomed
to playing with pain and injury. But with a playoff berth possible, the
Bears may bench Thomas to let the hamstring get closer to full strength.

""We could get there,"" said coach Dick Jauron. ""You definitely don't want to
do that, but any player that's out there that has an injury that causes them
to not only be not as effective as they can be but also risks further
injury, you don't want to expose him to that. We'll just have to monitor
that really closely.""


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


Just passing along.   Realize the Bears are thinking now much further past
just this game.   Dick Jauron knows Anthony Thomas will be a big part of
their playoff success and he may be thinking conservatively here.

WHITE PAPER: Taking the Corporate Risk out of Power Trading
             by Greg Keers, Chairman, KWI

Trading in power is not for the faint hearted. Supply and demand change by
the hour, which can cause extreme volatility in prices at the moment power
companies are committed to delivering to their customers. Any kind of
shortage at this point and prices will spike to the value of the lost load,
which may be many times more than the cost of supply. In the United States,
summer price spikes from $20 per MWh to $2,000 per MWh are not uncommon...

"RE:","Yeah, our offense was pathetic and OSU played really well.  Our defense
is tough but you don't deserve to play for championships when you
have 0 yards rushing against a defense that gave up over 1100 yards
in its last two games including 517 to freakin Baylor.   Best of luck
against Colorado.  I wonder which team will show up?

"[Footballguys] Update # 158  11-19   Week 11 Upgrade - Downgrade","Hi Folks,

Our Footballguy Scott Luebke takes a look at this week's Updgrades and
Downgrades.

Enjoy!

Joe

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Upgrades

QB - Aaron Brooks - Brooks and the Saints offense are clicking now and
Brooks' fantasy owners must be ecstatic.  Brooks has scored multiple
touchdowns in 3 of the last 4 weeks and I expect this trend to continue for
the remainder of the season.  With an easier schedule and better decision
making, Brooks has been able to connect with Aaron Brooks, Willie Jackson
and breakout tight end Boo Williams.

QB - Jeff Garcia - Garcia continues to put up exceptional numbers.  He has
thrown for 3 or more touchdowns in 5 of the last 6 games.  I wouldn't bench
Garcia in favor of any quarterback in the league right now.  He is a stud.

QB - Charlie Batch - Batch's 436 yard, 3 touchdown performance deserves
recognition.  However, I still think Batch will see bench time as the Lions
give backup Mike McMahon some playing time towards the end of the season for
the winless Lions.  A tough schedule remains for Batch and the Lions as
Green Bay, Chicago (2), Tampa Bay and Pittsburgh are left on the schedule.

QB - Rich Gannon - A strong performance on Sunday with 311 yards and 4
touchdowns proves Gannon and the Raiders offense is the team to beat in the
AFC.  With Tim Brown and Jerry Rice looking fantastic, Gannon will continue
to post good numbers for the remainder of the season.

QB - Kurt Warner - Warner looked good on Sunday night with 401 yards and 3
touchdowns.  More importantly, he did not appear to be hampered by a thumb
injury that has been nagging him throughout the season.  As always, keep
Warner in your starting lineup.

QB - Jake Plummer - Plummer looked good on Sunday with 334 passing yards and
4 touchdowns.  Keep in mind, this performance was against the hapless Lions.
Look for Plummer to return to his normal erratic self in the next two weeks
against San Diego and Oakland.  Plummer might be a good option for playoff
weeks as he faces Dallas in week 15 and Carolina in week 16.



RB - Shaun Alexander - Plain and simple, Alexander produces when he is in
the lineup.  He scored his 10th touchdown of the season on Sunday and nearly
cleared 100 yards once again.  Look for Alexander to remain the starter once
Watters returns from injury.

RB -  Duce Staley - Staley continues to look better and better.  The 133
total yards on Sunday will be a sign of things to come for Staley in the
second half of the season.  Philadelphia's offense and a rock solid defense
will keep the Eagles in the lead in the majority of games.  With Correll
Buckhalter in trouble with a team suspension due to marijuana, Staley will
not lose many carries to Buckhalter.

RB - Warrick Dunn - Dunn managed just 12 yards rushing against a solid Bears
defense, but a 12 catch, 138 yard receiving performance helps vault him into
the upgrades section.  More importantly, it appears that Dunn has returned
to 100% after being hampered by foot and hamstring injuries.

RB - Garrison Hearst - Hearst nearly reached the 100-yard plateau once
again.  He has looked good the last few weeks and should continue this trend
for the remainder of the season.  The 49ers offense continues to look good
and a favorable schedule gives Hearst the advantage over a majority of
starting running backs in the league.

RB - Ricky Williams - The Saints offense is looking sharp and efficient.
With Brooks making wise decisions, the offense will continue to get better
and this will lead to more scoring opportunities for Williams.  Williams has
topped the 120 yard mark in consecutive weeks.  Look for this trend to
continue as the Saints have a favorable schedule in the second half of the
season.



WR - Marty Booker - The Bears finally starting passing the ball downfield
and Booker's statistics were directly affected.  He burned the Buccaneers
for 3 long touchdowns on the day and made it look rather easy.  Look for
more longer passes out of the Bears in the second half of the season.  With
teams starting to ""sell out"" to the run, Booker and Miller should connect on
some play action pass touchdowns.

WR - Joe Horn - Horn remains one of the hottest receivers in the league with
8 catches for 148 yards on Sunday.  With Aaron Brooks making wiser
decisions, the New Orleans offense has started putting touchdowns on the
board.  Although this may be bad news for John Carney owners, it is good
news for Horn, Ricky Williams, and Willie Jackson.

WR - Jerry Rice - With Tim Brown receiving the majority of attention from
defenses, Rice will continue to be effective on the other side of the field.
The career touchdown leader added 3 more to his total on Sunday and made it
look rather easy.  With the Oakland offense looking good, Rice should
continue to see scoring chances.  A good option for a 3rd wide receiver in
your lineup.

WR - Peerless Price - With 10 catches and 138 yards receiving on Sunday,
Price continues to outperform Eric Moulds in the Bills offense and have many
fantasy owners questioning who is the number one receiver in Buffalo.  With
Eric Moulds being shut down with double teams, Price has quietly scored 5
touchdowns on the season.  Price is a talented receiver and should continue
to score a touchdown every other week.

WR - Hines Ward - Ward has amassed 26 catches in his last 3 games. He has
only scored two touchdowns on the season, but his reception and yardage
numbers are becoming a consistent factor on a weekly basis.  I've never been
a big fan of the Steelers passing game, but Ward deserves consideration for
active duty on a weekly basis.

WR - David Boston - Boston's 100-yard game streak ended this week.  Fantasy
owners had to settle for 80 yards receiving and 2 touchdowns.  Look for
Boston to continue to put up quality numbers.

Downgrades


QB - Brian Griese - The ankle injury to Rod Smith had me worried a little
bit heading into Sunday's game, so I was not surprised by Griese's poor
performance on Sunday.  With Smith hobbled by injuries and McCaffrey out for
the year, Griese's receiving options were limited and his production was
directly affected.  You may want to consider benching Griese until Smith is
healthy.  However, the Broncos do play Dallas on Thanksgiving.

QB - Tim Couch - Couch threw 3 interceptions and was held to 144 passing
yards against a stingy Ravens defense.  Couch should be considered a quality
keeper quarterback, but the Browns schedule will make Couch an inconsistent
quarterback for the remainder of this season.  Couch should do well against
Cincinnati and Jacksonville, but struggle against New England, Green Bay and
Pittsburgh.

QB - Mark Brunell - An injured quad injury kept Brunell out of the lineup
this week.  With an unfavorable matchup against Baltimore this week, it may
be best to start someone else this week.

QB - Elvis Grbac - Grbac looked horrible with 4 interceptions on Sunday.
The week was not a total disappointment for Grbac as he threw 2 touchdown
passes. The schedule looks favorable for Grbac, but he is struggling, which
concerns me.

QB - Tony Banks - Banks suffered a concussion in Sunday's game against
Denver.  The injury looked severe as Banks was slammed to the ground and
then taken off the field on a stretcher.

QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler threw 3 interceptions and 2 touchdowns on Sunday.
Unfortunately, Fiedler's two touchdowns were scored by the Jets defense.
The up and down season for Fiedler continues.  With games against Buffalo,
Indianapolis and San Francisco left on the schedule, Fiedler should still be
considered a quality ""spot starter"".



RB - Eddie George - George was held to 61 yards on 23 carries Sunday.  He
has yet to break the 100-yard barrier in a game this season.  I guess the
toe injury in the preseason affected his performance more than most
anticipated.  Although we can blame the toe injury, two other factors have
meant the demise of George this season.  First, the loss of lead back
Lorenzo Neal has minimized running lanes.  Finally, the Titans offensive
line is not giving George the quality run blocking of the previous seasons.

RB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas was held under 60 yards for the second
consecutive game.  With opposing defenses focusing on stopping the run,
Thomas will continue to find the running room a little tougher throughout
the remainder of the season.  Keep in mind, the Bears last two opponents
(Green Bay and Tampa Bay) are two of the better defenses against the run in
the league.  With Tampa Bay, Green Bay, Minnesota and Detroit (2) on the
schedule for the remainder of the season, expect Thomas' stats to be up and
down.

RB - Lamar Smith - With 53 rushing yards on 19 carries, Smith continues to
struggle.  This marks the 5th consecutive game that Smith has been held 3
yards/carry.  Don't be surprised if the Dolphins give Travis Minor a larger
role in the running game.

RB - Travis Henry - Henry continues to struggle.  He managed just 29 yards
on 13 carries this past Sunday and had a crucial fumble.  A running back can
not be productive with just 13 carries.  Keep him on your bench.



WR - Rod Smith - Suffering from an ankle injury, Smith was limited to 25
yards on three catches.  He did manage to score a touchdown.  Smith's ankle
injury deserved your attention.  The Broncos kept Smith on the sidelines
late in the 4th quarter while the team was attempting to drive down the
field and tie the ball game.  The short week will not help Smith's status on
Thanksgiving Day.

WR - Eric Moulds - The disappointing season for Moulds continues.  He was
held to 61 yards on Sunday while Peerless Price gained 138 on the other side
of the field.  Moulds may not even be the best fantasy option on the Bills
at this point.

WR - Wayne Chrebet - A shoulder injury to Chrebet limited his production on
Sunday.  Testaverde and the passing game isn't looking very good at this
point.  You may want to bench Chrebet until he is 100% healthy.

WR - Todd Pinkston - Pinkston has become a regular on the downgrade list.
Heck, I like the guy and think he could become special.  However, he remains
to do what is needed....produce on a consistent basis.

WR - Muhsin Muhammad - Muhammad suffered a sprained shoulder and was unable
to play in the second half against San Francisco.  Heck, his production was
not missed.  It's pretty difficult to miss little to no production, if you
know what I mean.  If you're a Muhammad owner, you know what I mean.

WR - Reggie Wayne - Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday and his status
is not yet known.  He has yet to do anything special this season, but his
expectations were fairly high, so I'll downgrade him



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Waiver Wire


Keep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12 and 14
team leagues.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Van Pelt stepped in the lineup and looked good on
Sunday with 316 passing yards and two touchdowns.  He has a talented
receiving crew with Moulds, Price and Riemersma.  As long as he can get pass
protection, his production could be a welcome addition to fantasy teams in
need of a quarterback.

RB - Ben Gay - Gay was the feature back on Sunday with 18 carries for 56
yards and a touchdown against a quality Baltimore Ravens defense.  No other
running back has taken over the reigns of the Browns rushing offense.  Gay
may just be that guy.

RB - Amos Zeroue - Although he suffered a sprained shoulder against the
Browns, Zeroue is expected to return to the team this week against
Jacksonville.  If you have Jerome Bettis on your team, Zeroue deserves a
roster spot.  If not, you may want to take a flyer on this guy.  The
Steelers have a solid running game and an injury to Bettis would open the
door for Zeroue to produce quality numbers.

RB - Lamont Jordan - Jordan is in a similar situation as Zeroue.  If Curtis
Martin gets injured, Jordan would enter the lineup and produce quality
numbers.  Not a bad option, if you can spare a roster spot.  If you have
Curtis Martin, get Lamont Jordan.

WR - JJ Stokes - Stokes looked good on Sunday with 72 yards and a touchdown.
This marks the second consecutive game with 72 yards.  With the 49ers
looking good in the passing game, a healthy Stokes could be a decent ""spot
starter"".

WR - Keith Poole - Poole was unable to do anything on Sunday against the
Redskins.  However, he continues to learn the offense and should start
producing very shortly.  Poole's effectiveness will most likely occur with a
healthy Rod Smith garnering double/triple teams on the opposite side of the
field.

TE - ""Boo"" Williams - ""Boo"" has me excited about his potential.  He's a big,
fast tight end with good hands.  Plain and simple, he has big play potential
and should produce in the Saints offense.

"American Citizen","This is an Editorial written by an American citizen, published in
a Tampa
Newspaper. He did quite a job.


 IMMIGRANTS, NOT AMERICANS, MUST ADAPT I am tired of this nation
worrying
 about whether we are offending some individual or their culture.
Since
 the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, we have experienced a surge in
patriotism
 by the majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks
had barely
 settled when the ""politically correct"" crowd began complaining
about the
 possibility that our patriotism was offending others. I am not
against
 immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is seeking
a
 better life by coming to America. Our population is almost
entirely comprised of
 descendants of immigrants. However, there are a few things that
those who
 have recently come to our country, and apparently some born here,
need to
 understand. This idea of America being a multicultural community
has
 served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity.
As Americans,
 we have our own culture, our own society, our own language and
our own
 lifestyle. This culture has been developed over centuries of
struggles,
 trials, and victories by millions of men and women who have
sought
 freedom.
 We speak ENGLISH, not Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese,
Russian, or any
 other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our
society,
 learn the language! ""In God We Trust"" is our national motto. This
is not some
 Christian, right wing, political slogan. We adopted this motto
because
 Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this
nation,
 and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to
display it on
 the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you
consider
 another part of the world as your new home, because God is part
of our
 culture. If Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't like Uncle
Sam,
 then you should seriously consider a move to another part of this
planet. We
 are happy with our culture and have no desire to change, and we
really don't
 care how you did things where you came from. This is OUR COUNTRY,
our
 land, and our lifestyle. Our First Amendment gives every citizen
the right to
 express his opinion and we will allow you every opportunity to do
so.
 But, once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about
our flag, our
 pledge, our national motto, or our way of life, I highly
encourage you to
 take advantage of one other great American freedom, THE RIGHT TO
LEAVE!

Please pass this along if you agree.

"[Footballguys] Thanks From Footballguys.com","Warning:  No Football information in this one.


Hi Folks,

Took a Power Nap after sending out our last update in week 17 and just woke
up... :)    Actually, I've been pouring myself into the ""other"" job (the one
that pays the bills and makes this one possible) getting ready for the boat
show season (www.bryantboats.com)  Also reintroduced myself to my wife and
kids.

I know you're busy with your own stuff but wanted to drop one more email in
your box this season and say thanks for letting us serve you this year at
Footballguys.com.  It's truly been a blast.  I can remember one night this
Summer as David and I were ""discussing"" (a nice word for ""yelling at each
other"") the VBD App on a Tuesday night about 4 am.  I looked at the clock
and said, ""We've got to be the dumbest guys in the world staying up all
night to do this"".  He paused and said, ""Yeah, but it's FUN, isn't it?""   I
had to agree it is.

I won't get sappy, but looking back on our season, it's pretty clear a lot
has happened since last Spring when we started mailing these updates.  In a
weird way, we sort of came through some of that stuff together.   That's
cool.

David and I have said all along that the strength of the site lies in the
people that visit and support it and we truly believe that.   Feedback from
you folks helped shape the site significantly.  Input / comments / death
threats from you greatly helped us in creating the VBD Draft App.  A large
number of our Breaking News Updates were stories that one of you sent me and
I'd in turn pass along to the 33,000+ people on the email list.  I tried to
operate on the philosophy of ""You'll Know What I Know"" sending you the
stories usually seconds after I received them.   Our message boards on the
site were another invaluable source for information and community.

Very simply: The site rocked because you guys rocked.

And for that, we wanted to say thanks for allowing us to be a small part of
your Fantasy Football Season.

Over the next several months, we'll be hammering out what improvements we
can make for 2002 and subscribers to this list will be the first to know
what's up.

Thanks again and we sincerely wish you and yours all the best in everything.

Joe and David

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 01/08/02
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Bettis will play in the team's Divisional Playoff Game in two weeks. ""There's no question about the next game,"" Bettis said, ""I'll be fine."" Bettis missed Pittsburgh's final five games of the year due to a groin injury, but seems to have healed sufficiently enough to get back into the starting lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to Phillynews.com, Buckhalter will see an increase in playing time behind starter Duce Staley on Saturday against Tampa Bay. Buckhalter, who ran for 89 yards against the Bucs on Sunday night, may even find himself in the same backfield as Staley in certain sets. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 01/08/02
Starting tailback Charlie Garner is a bit banged up, so Wheatley could see some additional carries on Saturday against the N.Y. Jets. ""He gave us some pop inside, inside the five (-yard line),"" Head Coach Jon Gruden told the Contra Costa Times . ""The physical finish that allowed us to score a touchdown early in the game was vintage Tyrone Wheatley. No question, we'd like to see a heavier dose of the big man as the playoffs begin."" Garner is expected to start, but Wheatley will likely get a majority of the short-yard and goal-line carries. 

Bills <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=4&>, DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Defensive end Phil Hansen announced his retirement from football this week. ""My body and my heart tell me it's time to move on. I've known for a long time now that this would be my final season. I tried to keep it a secret because I didn't want it to become a distraction to any of my teammates,"" Hansen told the Boston Globe . Hansen started his career by making three straight Super Bowl appearances, but he ended his 11-year tenure one day after the Bills worst season (3-13) since 1985.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 01/08/02
Gadsden, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo with a hamstring injury, will start on Sunday against Baltimore. However, he may be hard pressed to up good numbers against the Ravens' tough secondary. 

Dolphins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=15&>, DT MIA - Martin Updated 01/08/02
Linebacker Zach Thomas missed Sunday's game against Buffalo because of muscle spasms in his neck and pain from a muscle strain in his shoulder. ""I won't be [sitting out] this week,"" Thomas told the Miami Herald. Thomas said he would have played if it were a playoff game, but he sat out so he wouldn't worsen the injuries for the postseason. 

Chris Chambers <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Chambers suffered a sprained right ankle during Sunday's win over Buffalo. The rookie now has sprains in both of his ankles, and was removed from the game as a precaution. However, Chambers is expected to play in Sunday's game against Baltimore. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1226&>, WR GB - Hunter Updated 01/08/02
Freeman is nursing sore ribs, but he is expected to play on Sunday against San Francisco. The veteran wideout finished the regular season with 52 catches for 818 yards and five touchdowns. 

D'Wayne Bates <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=133222&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Bates could remain the No. 2 receiver for Chicago even if Dez White returns from a hamstring injury. ""It's something we'll have to look at,"" Coach Dick Jauron said. ""Hopefully Dez will be back and ready to play, and then we'll! s! ee where he is. Dez has done a real nice job for us, and D'Wayne has certainly stepped up and played really well."" Bates has been productive in White's absence, posting 157 yards receiving over the past two games. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 01/08/02
Brookins returned from a foot injury on Monday night against Minnesota. He carried the ball seven times for 15 yards, and is expected to see an increase in his carries next Sunday against Miami. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 01/08/02
Janikowski will be available for Saturday's Wild Card Game against the N.Y. Jets. He had been dealing with a bout of cellulitis in his foot, but seems to have healed sufficiently after missing the team's regular season finale. 

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Fuamatu-Ma'afala left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a minor groin injury. The injury isn't considered serious, however, so Fuamatu-Ma'afala will be ready for Pittsburgh's Divisional Playoff game in two weeks. 

Seahawks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Linebacker Anthony Simmons left Sunday's game against Kansas City in the second quarter after suffering a bruised left thigh. He did not return, and was on crutches and had his thigh heavily bandaged after the game. Corner! ba! ck Shawn Springs started the game at cornerback, but played only the first series before leaving with a nagging hamstring injury. ""If we had to play one more football game, I'm not sure they could go next week,"" Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 

Eddie Kennison <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1296&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Kennison suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. The injury isn't considered serious. Kennison had three catches for 74 yards in the game, and finished the year with 31 receptions for 491 yards and one touchdown. 

Kurt Warner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 01/07/02
Warner was hit in the throat during Sunday's St. Louis' 31-13 win over Atlanta, and has been told not to talk for a week. ""They gave him some steroids, I think, to keep the swelling down, but he's fine,"" Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Warner said he got hit with either or knee or an elbow. ""They just think there's some swelling around the vocal chords,"" Warner said. ""It was tough to call (plays) in the huddle. Guys were laughing at me a little bit."" Warner is fine and will start in the Divisional Round of the playoffs in two weeks. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 01/07/02
Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. ""It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain,"" Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game."" Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
McNair missed the second half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to back spasms. The injury isn't considered serious. McNair had an outstanding season, finishing with 3,350 yards passing and 26 total touchdowns. 

Tony Banks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Banks suffered a sprained right knee in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 20-17 win over Arizona. Banks, who may have played his final game as a Washington Redskin, will be re-evaluated this week. 

Charlie Garner <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 01/07/02
Garner suffered a foot injury during Sunday's 24-22 loss to the N.Y. Jets. He finished the game, however, and is expected to start in Oakland's opening-round playoff game. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=187389&>, K OAK - Matty Updated 01/07/02
Janikowski missed Sunday's game against the N.Y. Jets due to a bout with cellulitis in his foot. Brad Daluiso kicked in his absence, and missed one field goal and an extra point. Janikowski will be re-evaluated this week, and should be available for Oakland's opening-round playoff game, barring any setbacks. 

Amani Toomer <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 01/07/02
Toomer suffered a concussion during Sunday's 34-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers. The injury isn't considered too serious. Toomer finished the game with five receptions for 79 yards, giving him 72 catches for 1,054 yards and five touchdowns on the year. 

Terry Glenn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 01/07/02
Glenn was inactive for Sunday's game against Carolina, and didn't make the trip to Charlotte with the team. According to the Boston Globe, there was much speculation as to why Glenn didn't play. One report indicated New England has already decided not to play him in the playoffs, and another said Glenn had missed meetings. Glenn did have an excused absence Wednesday, when he had to attend to a personal matter. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 01/07/02
Horn left Sunday's game against San Francisco in the third quarter with a sprained left knee and did not return. He caught three passes for 44 yards before suffering the injury, and finished the season with 83 catches for 1,265 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns. 

Cris Carter <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Tori Updated 01/07/02
Carter (ribs) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Baltimore. It is still uncertain whether or not Carter will play, so Jake Reed could see some extended playing time. In any event, the game will likely be Carter's last in a Minnesota Vikings' uniform. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=12400&>, TE KC - Russell Updated 01/07/02
Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. ""Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury,"" General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. ""The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look."" Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season. Furth! er! tests are expected to be taken this week. 

Mike Hollis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1387&>, K JAC - Giggles Updated 01/07/02
Hollis was benched late in Sunday's game against Chicago after having a first-quarter field goal blocked and later missing his second extra point of the season. Hollis, who is now an unrestricted free agent, is not expected to return to the Jaguars for the 2002 season. 

Marcus Pollard <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Pollard left Sunday's game against Denver in the third quarter with a sprained left knee. He finished the contest with two catches for 11 yards in the Colts' 29-10 victory. 

James Stewart <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hunter Updated 01/07/02
Stewart (ankle) played in Sunday's game against Dallas after being listed as questionable for most of the week. The veteran tailback rushed for 69 yards in Detroit's 15-10 win. 

Terrell Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 01/07/02
According to the Denver Post , Davis expects to return to Denver for the 2002 season. ""I expect to be back, unless you know something I don't know,"" Davis said. ""I want to be here. I think we'll find a happy medium for both sides. It will be a win-win situation, I believe."" Davis is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent.

Jason Elam <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=4540&key=1383&>, K DEN - Martin Updated 01/07/02
According to the Rocky Mountain News, Elam has about a 50-50 chance of returning to Denver next season. ""I've met every goal that I had coming into the season,"" Elam said. ""I'm very happy with the individual season I had. I just wish the team could have gotten better."" Elam is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent.

    MEMO FROM GOD  
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/Btflysilver.gif>
To: YOU  
Date: TODAY 
From: THE BOSS  
Subject: YOURSELF  
Reference: LIFE  
I am God. Today I will be handling all of your problems. Please remember that I do not need your help.  
If life happens to deliver a situation to you that you cannot handle, do not attempt to resolve it. Kindly put it in the SFGTD (something for God to do) box. All situations will be resolved, but in My time, not yours. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/sfgtd.gif>
Once the matter is placed into the box, do not hold onto it by worrying about it.  Instead, focus on all the wonderful things that are present in your life now. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/swing.gif>
If you find yourself stuck in traffic; Don't despair. There are people in this world for whom driving is an unheard of privilege. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/traffic.gif>
Should you have a bad day at work; Think of the man who has been out of work for years. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/man_walk.gif>
Should you despair over a relationship gone bad; Think of the person who has never known what it's like to love and be loved in return. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/rockincrotchity1x1.gif>
Should you grieve the passing of another weekend;  Think of the woman in dire straits, working twelve hours a day, seven days a week to feed her children. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/sew2.gif>
Should your car break down, leaving you miles away from assistance; Think of the paraplegic who would love the opportunity to take that walk.  
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/wheelchr.gif>
Should you notice a new gray hair in the mirror; Think of the cancer patient in chemo who wishes she had hair to examine. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/nurse_use.gif>
Should you find yourself at a loss and pondering what is life all about, asking what is my purpose? Be thankful. There are those who didn't live long enough to get the opportunity. 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/angel_baby.jpg>
Should you find yourself the victim of other people's bitterness, ignorance, smallness or insecurities; Remember, things could be worse. You could be one of them! 
  <http://www.webspirations.net/images/women_talking.gif>
Should you decide to send this to a friend; Thank you, you may have touched their life in ways you will never know!

"RE:","no, no more motorcycles.  i'm working for an engineering consulting firm
near the galleria, and i really enjoy it.  i've been here several months,
and it seems to fly by.  my lease was up at the gables at the end of
october, so i have been looking for a townhouse for the last couple of
months.  i've found several i like, but none i'm extremely crazy about.  for
thanksgiving, i went and delivered food for meals on wheels with Oma, and
then ate with my family.  it was really nice.  the girls are so grown up
now!  mom and dad are getting along better than ever!  i got some of my
christmas shopping done over the weekend as well.  other than that, not too
much else going on in my life. for once in my life, i feel as though i don't
have much stress.  it is actually a wonderful feeling!  what about you?
where are you living, etc?

If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=1663&""><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - The Guzzlers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.   </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=1069&""><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=146325&""><B>Jeff Garcia</B></A>, QB SF - The Guzzlers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=1174&""><B>Eddie George</B></A>, RB TEN - Thrill Kill Cult <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury.

<FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=12207&""><B>Fred Beasley</B></A>, RB SF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Beasley broke his right hand. He will probably be sidelined for the rest of the regular season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=1511&""><B>Joe Horn</B></A>, WR NO - The Lie Downs <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Horn is once again performing like an elite Fantasy receiver. He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=12797&""><B>Kurt Warner</B></A>, QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.

Rich Gannon</B></A>, QB OAK - The Executioners <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=12576&""><B>Randy Moss</B></A>, WR MIN - Meximullets <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts. Don't hesitate to start him during your playoff run.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=235122&""><B>Marvin Minnis</B></A>, WR KC - North Blvd Nutwhackers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Minnis hasn't done much to help Fantasy owners this year.

He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1734&key=235213&""><B>Rod Gardner</B></A>, WR WAS - Not So Nice Machine <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gardner has been very inconsistent this season.

Harrison will be an important Fantasy player during the final weeks of the NFL season.

Warner was hit in the throat during Sunday's St. Louis' 31-13 win over Atlanta. ""They gave him some steroids, I think, to keep the swelling down, but he's fine,"" Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Warner said he got hit with either or knee or an elbow. ""They just think there's some swelling around the vocal chords,"" Warner said. ""It was tough to call (plays) in the huddle. Guys were laughing at me a little bit."" Warner is fine and will start in the Divisional Round of the playoffs in two weeks. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=1294&> , WR STL - The Guzzlers Updated 01/07/02
Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. ""It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain,"" Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game."" Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks. 

Steve McNair <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=1069&>, QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 01/07/02

Glenn was inactive for Sunday's game against Carolina, and didn't make the trip to Charlotte with the team. According to the Boston Globe, there was much speculation as to why Glenn didn't play. One report indicated New England has already decided not to play him in the playoffs, and another said Glenn had missed meetings. Glenn did have an excused absence Wednesday, when he had! t! o attend to a personal matter. 

Joe Horn <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=1511&>, WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 01/07/02

Carter (ribs) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Baltimore. It is still uncertain whether or not Carter will play, so Jake Reed could see some extended playing time. In any event, the game will likely be Carter's last in a Minnesota Vikings' uniform. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=12400&>, TE KC - The Executioners Updated 01/07/02
Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. ""Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury,"" General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. ""The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look."" Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season.! F! urther tests are expected to be taken this week. 

Mike Hollis <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=1387&>, K JAC - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 01/07/02

Terrell Davis <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 01/07/02
According to the Denver Post , Davis expects to return to Denver for the 2002 season. ""I expect to be back, unless you know something I don't know,"" Davis said. ""I want to be here.

Jason Elam <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=1383&>, K DEN - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/07/02
According to the Rocky Mountain News, Elam has about a 50-50 chance of returning to Denver next season. ""I've met every goal that I had coming into the season,"" Elam said. ""I'm very happy with the individual season I had. I just wish the team could have gotten better."" Elam is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent. 

T.J. Houshmandzadeh <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=235086&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Houshmandzadeh left Sunday's game against Tennessee with a sprained left ankle. X-rays were negative, however, and the injury isn't considered very serious. 

Dez White <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=187682&>, WR CHI - The Snake Pit Updated 01/07/02
White (hamstring) was inactive for Sunday's game against Jacksonville. However, he expects to be ready for the team's Divisional Playoff Game in two weeks. 

Wesley Walls <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=1321&>, TE CAR - The Snake Pit Updated 01/07/02
Walls will have reconstructive surgery on his left knee on Monday, and is expected to be ready for the start of the 2002 season. However, the Charlotte Observer is reporting that Walls likely won't be back in Carolina next year. The veteran tight end could be made available for the expansion draft, or may be released from the team altogether. 

Alex Van Pelt <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=1011&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Van Pelt suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's 34-7 loss to Miami. ""I'm a little sore,"" Van Pelt told the Buffalo News. ""I think what happened is basically the shoulder came out of the capsule in the back. It's nothing too serious, but when I tried to throw on the sidelines, I didn't have any strength."" Van Pelt later stated that doctors expect his shoulder to be completely healthy in between six-to-eight weeks. 

Michael Bennett <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=235196&>, RB MIN - The Fat Bastards Updated 01/06/02
Bennett was not limited in practice Friday due to a sore heel, and should be able to play Monday against Baltimore. He's still a very risky start against the tough Ravens rush defense.

Martin Gramatica <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=133297&>, K TB - One Man Show Updated 01/06/02
The Bucs are expected to rest Gramatica this week due to a hamstring injury. Doug Brien will likely handle the kicking duties Sunday against Philadelphia, but we don't recommend you use either player in Week 17.

Crumpler will start Sunday's game against St. Louis as a result of an injury to Reggie Kelly. Crumpler, who has been somewhat useful in recent weeks, could be worth using in Week 17.

Maddox took extra snaps in practice this week and could replace Kordell Stewart as early as halftime Sunday in order to keep the latter healthy for the playoffs. We don't recommend you use either player based on their abbreviated playing time.

James McKnight <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 01/06/02
McKnight practiced Friday and will play Sunday. He has been recovering from the effects of a concussion.

Fred Taylor <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2104&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Not So Nice Machine Updated 01/06/02
Jaguars Head Coach Tom Coughlin declared Taylor out for Sunday's game against Chicago due to the groin strain that has kept him out since Sept. 23. He appeared in just two games this season, and you'll need to monitor his progress over the offseason before considering drafting him in 2002.

Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. ""It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain,"" Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game."" Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks.

Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. ""Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury,"" General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. ""The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look."" Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season. Further! t! ests are expected to be taken this week.

"Excelergy Kicks Off 2002 with 2 Major Agreements","  <http://www.excelergy.com/images/colorbar.jpg> <http://www.excelergy.com/>
 
  January 14, 2002   
Happy New Year from Excelergy!
 

We're writing to keep updated on significant news detailing Excelergy's expanding corporate growth and success. Following a record-setting 2001, Excelergy has continued its strong momentum in 2002 with the signing of two major agreements. 

FIRST MEDIA/COMMUNICATIONS CLIENT 
  <http://www.excelergy.com/images/spacer.gif>
In an extraordinary validation of the flexibility, scalability and speed of Excelergy's products, Virginia-based S? Entertainment, a broadband video and interactive service provider, officially joined the growing Excelergy client family. In partnership with systems integrator Xperts Inc., Excelergy continues to expand its market reach. 

                          <http://www.excelergy.com/images/purple_arrow.gif>   www.excelergy.com/news/jan07-02.html <http://www.excelergy.com/news/jan07-02.html> 

While our bedrock vertical will always remain the energy/utility industry, we've now made our first mark in another exciting market! 

JOINS MICROSOFT TO DELIVER GROUNDBREAKING WEB SERVICES 
  <http://www.excelergy.com/images/spacer.gif>
Excelergy is combining key elements of its open, componentized, native XML technology platform with the Microsoft .NET application development platform, delivering the most advanced Web services available in the energy/utility industry. 

                          <http://www.excelergy.com/images/purple_arrow.gif>  www.excelergy.com/news/jan09-02.html <http://www.excelergy.com/news/jan09-02.html> 

Though this industry trend is just now being recognized by other companies, Excelergy's products have been delivering XML Web services to our clients for more than two years. Recently, Microsoft has established leadership among its competitors in this area, and our common view strengthens our relationship. 

CEO BILL MAHONEY IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
  <http://www.excelergy.com/images/spacer.gif>
Both of these announcements position Excelergy as consistently ""ahead of the curve"" in delivering the most advanced products and technology to restructuring markets. This kind of leadership is why CEO Bill Mahoney was recently called on byThe Boston Globe  to give his ""front row look"" at major issues facing companies in the energy industry. 

                          <http://www.excelergy.com/images/purple_arrow.gif>  The Boston Globe - 12/23/01 - view PDF file <http://www.excelergy.com/news/images/BostonGlobe-Mahoney-122301.pdf> 

Stay connected with us as we have more exciting news planned for the coming weeks. The week of January 22 we'll be announcing details about our record-setting 2001. Until then, we wish you an enjoyable and prosperous 2002!

Got that January lethargy?  Experiencing post-holiday doldrums?  If so, you need to drink more St. Arnold's!  This elixir is known to create excitement in your life and can cure the common cold.

Looking for Christmas Ale? 
We have had some calls from people experiencing Christmas Ale withdrawal.  If you suffer from this ailment, we know of a couple of places with a few cases left.  We can't tell everyone where it is, but if you call or email us, we can tell you individually. 

Spread the Word 
You are the reason that we have experienced such strong growth this past year.  Most people find out about us because someone like you has told them about us (that's a lot of pronouns).  Please keep telling your friends.  Also, if you have a favorite restaurant/bar that doesn't carry our beer, let us know.  If you manage to sell it in, let us know and we will reward you! 

Anyone Seen our Cable TV Ads? 
We have been running some ads on the Optel/Showcase cable network.  We are curious if anyone has seen them.  If so, please let us know (along with any comments).  Did you suddenly experience the uncontrollable urge to open a cold St. Arnold? 

Thanks again for all your support, and remember to recycle your six pack carriers.   

Cheers,

Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday.

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

So let me know if you would be interested and, if so, when you would be available to go.   The cost should be around $30-40 a person.

Please forward to anyone I have forgotten or might be interested.

WITH LOW AIRFARES TO FLORIDA AND SAN JUAN, THINK CRUISE FROM $199 FOR 3 DAYS & $399 FOR 7 DAYS 

One of the best values this winter could be a cruise vacation on the Seven Seas. Wake up on a new island every day; all room and board is paid for. 24 hours of meals and the midnight buffet still starts at midnight. Can you believe that there are select sailings for as low as $199 per person for a three-day Nassau cruise or a seven-day eastern Caribbean cruise for only $399 per person? Of course you are not going to get the best cabin at these prices, but for as little as $60 to $100 more you can upgrade to the outside cabins. The trick is to be flexible! One week, a seven-day cruise could sell for $899 per person and the next week the same cruise could go for only $399 per person. Check out all of these short notice specials. This could be your best value for 2002. Visit <http://www.cheapcruises.com> Remember, if you're buying a cruise-only package and purchasing your airfare separately, try to fly in the day before. This will give you time to relax. Flying in the day of the cruise could be very stressful, especially if your plane delayed, cancelled, bad weather or Murphy's Law sets in.

"Re: What's Up","Eric,

Good to hear from you.  Hope you had a good Christmas and New Year's vacation.  I just got back to Boston last night.  I was in KY until the 30th then went skiing in Colorado (Copper and Winter Park) with some friends from here.  The snow wasn't great at Copper, but Winter Park was great and snowed the entire time we were there.  It's nice to be back at school, but I'm not looking forward to studying again.  Crossword puzzles and mutual fund research sound glorious right now.  Finals weren't too bad at all.  Normal classes are pretty intense, so there isn't much you can do in the way of preparation except relax and get plenty of sleep.  

Glad to hear that you still have a job.  I've been keeping up with Enron in the papers.  What's the latest on the trading division sale?  I knew that Citigroup had made a bid, but is anyone else expected to come in?  Summer internship interviews are coming up, so I'm sure I'll have plenty to talk about with Enron on my resume.  How are all of our friends making out?  I got an email from Plauche that he had been laid off.  What about Lenhart, Boucher, Chad, and everyone else?  

My dentist is Brian Kilgore, whom I liked very much.  He's out on I-10 and the Beltway.  He referred me to Thomas Weiler for the wisdom teeth surgery.  I think he's covered under the Enron dental plan, too.  

Enjoy the downtime while you have it.  Say hello to your family for me.  


Brian

<FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=1321&""><B>Wesley Walls</B></A>, TE CAR - The Snake Pit <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=133297&""><B>Martin Gramatica</B></A>, K TB - One Man Show <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>

Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=1663&""><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - The Guzzlers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.   </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=1069&""><B>Steve McNair</B></A>
, QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half.

He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

Fred Beasley</B></A>, RB SF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Beasley broke his right hand.

A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks.

He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=235174&""><B>Chris Weinke</B></A>, QB CAR - The Lie Downs <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=1577&key=12797&""><B>Kurt Warner</B></A>, QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.

He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. </FONT>

, WR WAS - The Snake Pit <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player.

"Re: UBS","Hi Eric,
 
I am excited that you will get back to work now.  I know you don't like being bored.
 
Sorry about Tahoe.  Las Vegas sounds interesting.  I'll talk to Dad.  I talked with Vivian this morning and we are planning on a golf trip maybe to Mexico.  I don't know when we will be going.  Las Vegas is not my first choice for a vacation after such a long time without one.  However, I welcome any opportunity to spend time with our son.  I'll talk with him tonight and let you know.
 
Have a great weekend.  Hi to Shanna.
 
Love you, Mom

Thanks.  Of the two - I think UBS is better.  It seems like they are a smaller, more specialized company that is more similar to our culture from a risk tolerance perspective.  It should be good.  Of course, anything is better than the way it has been.
 
We are not going to be able to go to Tahoe anymore b/c of scheduling conflicts with my boss, so we are planning on going to Las Vegas from Feb 13-16.  The airfare is $200/person roundtrip and we can stay at the aladdin or rio for about $100/night (or the bellagio for $200/night). We were wondering if you guys would be interested in joining us?
 
Let me know.

OK the final plans have been made for the bachelor party.  We will meet at 5 pm SHARP at Cinemark Theaters on Richmond and Sam Houston Parkway (Beltway 8).  This is the movie theater across the street from Jason's apartment.  You need to be there on time so that we can make the cruise.

Let me know if you have questions.

I have made reservations for Jason's Bachelor Party.  You are the chosen few.  The cruise is set for Sat. Jan 19 at 7 pm out of Freeport.  Transportation will be arranged for you.  We need to leave at about 5 pm on the 19th.  I will arrange a meeting place and relay it to you in a future e-mail.  The final tally will be $32 a person. I have paid for this already so you can reimburse me on the 19th and I can promptly blow all of that money on gambling.  Sadly, the gourmet dinner was not available on the Freeport cruise so we will have to suffer through a buffet dinner.

Let me know if you have any questions.

"BBall 2-on-2 Tournament","1st Annual 2-on-2 Basketball Tournament

When:          November 17th @ 11AM

Where:         4527 Holly St.
          Bellaire, TX 77401

Details:       It will be a 2-on-2 tournament at my house starting around
11AM.  I should have college football games on all day in the house.  LSU,
UT, and A&M are all off that weekend.

I'm supplying all the gatorade, ice, and anything else we may need.  Bring
$5 to pay for the gatorade and whatever is left over can buy beer/go to the
winners.

We will not setup teams.  You either come with your partner or come hoping
that someone else needs a partner, too.

It will be a double-elimination tournament on a 8 1/2 or 9 ft. goal and
scoring will go as follows: to seven by ones, winning by two or first to
ten points to keep games moving.  We may need to put a time limit on games
if we have too many teams.

If someone has an old TV that they can bring over, we can put it on in the
garage in the backyard.

If you want to reply to me, please don't reply to all.  This invitation is
not limited to people in the cc: field, but please don't invite another ten
people.  We should have enough teams.

Call me, or send me an email, if you have any questions.

Thanks -
Val

Hotwire Stories

""We used Hotwire for a 4-star hotel in downtown Chicago. The rate was
$57/night(I still can't believe it!) and the hotel was fantastic. Now
I plan to use Hotwire for hotels whenever I travel. I've told several
people about Hotwire and my very positive experience. Thanks!""

"[Footballguys] Pittman Correction - Happy Thanksgiving - Joke","Quick note for you Pittman owners I may have worried with my comment about
Thomas Jones scoring the Goalline TD.

I'd forgotten my buddy Jim from Arizona had told me this:   Michael Pittman
wears contact lenses and had a problem with one of his contacts at the
goalline so Jones came in.   If Pittman had not had the problem, he would
have likely gotten the score that Jones did.  (Hope none of you Pittman
owners lost by a TD last week...)

Thanks Jim for keeping me straight.

Actually, I'm using that goof as a chance for David and I, along with the
Footballguys.com staff, to wish you a very Happy Thanksgiving.   It's a
always a time for reflecting on the things we're thankful for and I know
I've got more than I can count.   Hope you do too.   Have a great day and
travel safely if you're going anywhere.

And not to beat up on our Detroit faithful (and I know there are LOT of you
guys), but thought I'd share this one with you if you haven't heard it.
David sent to me this morning:

There is a mama lion, a daddy lion & a baby lion.  The mama lion & the daddy
lion were having a lot of fights so they decided to get a divorce.

The lion family goes in front of a judge to decide custody of the baby lion.
The judge asks the baby lion ""Do you wanna live with mama lion?""   The baby
lion answers ""No mama lion beats me.""  The judge said ""All right, do you
wanna live with daddy lion?""  The baby lion answers ""No daddy lion beats me
worse.""

The judge asks ""who do you wanna live with then?""

The baby answers  ""The Detroit Lions.  They don't beat anybody...""

Have a great weekend all.   Cheatsheets to follow soon.

Thursday against Dallas. However, the Cowboys' defense will probably focus on the run and force Griese to beat them through the air.

He's the best player in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in any league format. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1074&key=192822&""><B>Jamel White</B></A>, RB CLE - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
The Browns may use White as a change-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar Bengals run defense. You might want to consider him as a third running back option on your team if you're lacking in starting options.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1074&key=1366&""><B>Ernie Conwell</B></A>, TE STL - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1074&key=12797&""><B>Kurt Warner</B></A>, QB STL - Baja <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE!

>Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401 yards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and will throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent secondary. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1074&key=1633&""><B>O.J.

He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati secondary, so maybe this is one of the rare weeks he scores. Only use Santiago if you're desperate for a tight end, however, as he rarely gets a big yardage total.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1074&key=133324&""><B>Kevin Johnson</B></A>
, WR CLE - Top Dogs <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Johnson has been a prime target for Tim Couch in the Cleveland passing game this season, and is now a very reliable No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver. Johnson is on a real hot streak and has a good career record against the Bengals, his opponent for this week, so get him into your lineup.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1074&key=133260&""><B>Tim Couch</B></A>, QB CLE - Rocks <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Couch has a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards, four TDs), whom he will face on Sunday.

His matchup against Cleveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him reserved this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1074&key=1212&""><B>Darnay Scott</B></A>, WR CIN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Although Scott has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last two games against the Browns, whom he plays Sunday, we can't recommend you use him this week. He has been far too inconsistent and a real disappointment from a Fantasy perspective.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

Only use him if you have no other alternative on your bench.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1074&key=133393&""><B>Peerless Price</B></A>, WR BUF - Matt Lenhart <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Price has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recent weeks, logging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a bigger challenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reserving him.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1074&key=1196&""><B>Eric Moulds</B></A>, WR BUF - Matt Lenhart <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>There's a good chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week against a solid Miami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent limited role in the Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he has a good history against the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and he might be worth using as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=1074&key=235!

"Reliant Energy eBill","Just a reminder that your current Reliant Energy HL&P statement is ready
for you to review at https://ebill.reliantenergy.com/logon/

If you participate in the Automatic Payment Plan (APP), your bank account
will be automatically drafted for the amount due. Remember, with Auto Pay
no action is required to ensure your bill gets paid. If you do not
participate in Automatic Payment Plan (APP), you can pay your bill
immediately or schedule payment for a later date. As with paper bills your
payment is due about 2 weeks from the statement date. The online bill
replaces your paper bill, a paper copy of your bill will not be sent.

Should you need to modify your account information, go to
https://ebill.reliantenergy.com/logon/ log into eBill and select User
Information. There you can update your information such as your email
address, change your password and add accounts.

As you use our eBill service, please do not hesitate to provide comments
through the Contact Us section of the site. Check out the Frequently Asked
Questions section for a quick reference.

If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=641&key=1663&""><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.   </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=641&key=1069&""><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=641&key=146325&""><B>Jeff Garcia</B></A>, QB SF - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=641&key=1174&""><B>Eddie George</B></A>, RB TEN - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury.

<FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=641&key=12207&""><B>Fred Beasley</B></A>, RB SF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Beasley broke his right hand.

He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

, QB OAK - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=641&key=12576&""><B>Randy Moss</B></A>, WR MIN - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts.

<FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=734&key=133230&""><B>David Boston</B></A>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego.

In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=734&key=1663&""><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans.

He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=734&key=12363&""><B>Jay Fiedler</B></A>, QB MIA - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=734&key=133361&""><B>Donovan McNabb</B></A>, QB PHI - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions.

Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=734&key=1762&""><B>Isaac Byrd</B></A>, WR CAR - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday.

THOMAS SKIPS PRACTICE TO REST SORE HAMSTRING...
Posted Thursday November 22, 2001 @ 03:35 PT


According to chicagobears.com senior writer Larry Mayer, Anthony Thomas sat
out practice Wednesday with a strained right hamstring, but the Bears are
hopeful the rookie running back will start Sunday night's game against the
Minnesota Vikings at the Metrodome.

""We're concerned with him,"" head coach Dick Jauron admitted. ""He said he
felt better today than he felt yesterday. We'll monitor him right through
the week, but I don't think we're going to know anything really until close
to the end of the week.""

Jauron revealed that Thomas has been hampered by the nagging injury for a
few weeks. That would appear to explain the A-Train's recent decline in
production. The second-round pick rushed for 58 yards on 23 carries in last
Sunday's win at Tampa and 45 yards on 22 attempts a week earlier in a loss
to Green Bay.

In his three previous outings, Thomas averaged 137 yards on 27 carries
including a 188-yard performance in Cincinnati. That effort shattered a
67-year-old team rookie record held by Beattie Feathers, who rushed for 155
yards against Green Bay in 1934.

Thomas was named the NFL Rookie of the Month in October, but he hasn't
displayed the same explosive burst since. He had seven runs of at least 16
yards (46, 32, 23, 21, 19, 18, 16) in the first six games, but none longer
than 12 yards the last three weeks.

""He's not a guy who complains, but it's had to bother him and he's missed
practice time, which is not good either,"" Jauron said. ""When you have a
hamstring problem, you're going to feel it any time you try to accelerate at
all.

""He felt OK today in terms of where he was a week ago, but not good enough
to practice. We'll just have to see where that one goes.""

Thomas said Wednesday that he's confident he'll play against the Vikings and
felt the hamstring problem was related to a sore left big toe that's
bothered him most of the season. The toe is much improved, but he believes
it contributed to the hamstring injury.

""Once you favor one thing and compensate for something else, there's always
going to be something that's off-balance,"" Thomas said. ""I guess that's
probably one of the things that did it.

""My toe is coming around a lot better now. It's probably the best it ever
felt. Just from compensating, my leg's a little sore on the other side. But
my foot's doing real well.""

Thomas said he planned to test the hamstring Thursday in practice. If he
were unable to play Sunday, James Allen would replace him. Thomas supplanted
Allen as the starter after the rookie's 188-yard outburst Oct. 21 in
Cincinnati. The performance was the eighth best in team history and the most
prolific rushing day since the legendary Walter Payton had 192 yards on 28
carries on Nov. 3, 1985 at Green Bay.

Thomas ranks fifth in the NFC with 638 yards and 4 TDs on 150 carries (4.3
avg.), while Allen has rushed for 243 yards and 1 TD on 78 attempts (3.1).
Since losing the starting job, Allen has carried just five times in four
games for 36 yards.

Despite the limited action, the four-year veteran did contribute one of the
biggest plays of the season. He dove to catch a 34-yard Hail Mary TD pass
from Shane Matthews on the final play of regulation in an eventual overtime
win over Cleveland Nov. 4 at Soldier Field.

If Thomas is limited Sunday, Allen would relish the chance for more playing
time in what's the Bears' third of six straight divisional games. Last
season the Oklahoma product rushed for a career-high 1,120 yards and his 290
carries were the second most by a Bear since Payton retired.

""I'm ready,"" Allen said. ""We have a lot riding on this game, just like we do
week-in and week-out. I just have to play my part, see how it goes, and stay
into it mentally.

""Just to help this team win, if it's 10 carries or 25 carries, I've got to
do my part.""

Stay tuned. ... I'll have more on Thomas after today's practice.

"PROS To Host Revenue Optimization Web Seminar for Traders","For Immediate Release
 
 

PROS Revenue Management's Web Seminar: 


Energy Profit Optimization for Natural Gas Trading

 
January 29, 2002-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in pricing and revenue optimization science and software, invites you to its web seminar spotlighting natural gas trading profit optimization, will be hosted on February 7th, 3:00 - 4:00pm Central Time.
 
Executives from the world's most forward-thinking companies have already registered to attend the seminar.  This seminar is of particular interest because it will address the broader applicability of revenue optimization, which has proven to be a ""significantly effective competitive device"" in industries where it has been deployed effectively.  PROS Revenue Management solutions have been credited with delivering 6-8% incremental revenue and 20-100% incremental profits.  This Web seminar will allow industry leaders to learn from the experience PROS has gained in over 17 years of deploying these solutions.
 
The PROS Trading Optimization System utilizes PROS network optimization technology to optimally schedule natural gas volumes to market across multiple pipelines and provide buy/sell recommendations that maximize the revenue and utilization from all transportation assets.  In addition to the 10-15% profitability lift from optimal gas scheduling, the system also completely automates the scheduling process.  The PROS Trading Optimization System has been in live use since 2000.  Version 2.0 of the TOS system has been completely parameterized allowing companies to dynamically configure the system for multiple unique pipeline trading strategies and tariffs.  The result is the reduction of the gas scheduling process to less than 60 seconds.
 
The seminar will address topics critical to understand how revenue optimization can be deployed in specific environments, including the following:
How revenue optimization works, 
How to estimate the potential value of a revenue optimization system, 
What is required for a successful revenue optimization initiative, and
Examples of revenue optimization success 
 
The Web format for the seminar will allow participants to attend from remote locations, ask questions in real-time, and interact with the presenter through an Internet browser and toll-free telephone number.  This seminar is free of charge but space is limited.

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

"Come see the new MOA bookstore...","Dear Americans,

Well, it's that time of year again. The Holiday season is
upon us, and we're all thinking about gift ideas.

That is why I had to write you today, to let you know that
now at MillionsofAmericans.com there is an important new
addition to the site.

http://www.millionsofamericans.com/home/bookstore.cfm
<A href = ""http://www.millionsofamericans.com/home/bookstore.cfm"" >AOL Users Click here</A>

I am pleased to announce the opening of The Activist
Library, a place where I have put a few of my favorite
selections.

Listed you will find a diverse selection; everything from
Tom Clancy's ""Debt of Honor"", to William Manchester's
""Alone"", a biography of Winston Churchill during the darkest
period of his life.

http://www.millionsofamericans.com/home/bookstore.cfm
<A href = ""http://www.millionsofamericans.com/home/bookstore.cfm"" >AOL Users Click here</A>

If your favorite book is not listed, please email me.

My hope is that this Library will be a place where
conservatives can come together, share ideas, browse, and
maybe even get a little bit of an education from some of the
greatest minds available on what it truly means to be a
conservative.

Thanks again for all of your support, and if I do not talk
to all of you again before, have a wonderful Thanksgiving.

God bless you all, and keep in touch.

For America,

"[Footballguys] Update # 160 11-21 Week 11 Passing Matchups","Hi Folks,

Trying to get this to you earlier as many people had asked for it sooner.

Hope you have a great and joyful Thanksgiving.

Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for
exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always
receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Peyton
Manning may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on
Kurt Warner or Daunte Culpepper, Manning's your guy no matter who he's
lining up against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in
your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike
Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info.   The points scored by position data is from our Footballguy
Clayton Gray.  Let's get to it.

Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that should be overmatched against the
Offense.


Arizona Passing Game vs San Diego Defense

We rated Plummer as a ""Lock"" matchup and he delivered with 334 yards and 4
TDs.   If only they could play Detroit each week...  This week, they'll face
a San Diego team that ranks just # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   WR David
Boston is unstoppable and a must start.   Frank Sanders played well too last
week but had what looked to be a pretty serious hamstring injury on the TD
reception.   Check Plummer's status as he has a bruised tailbone but I'd
feel good about him again this week.


Atlanta Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

Chris Chandler continued his up and down season with a nice outing last week
leading the Falcons to a huge upset over the Packers.   He threw for 352
yards and 2 TDs.   Terance Mathis led the way with 7 receptions.   Mathis
suffered a concussion but the early reports are that he'll be able to go.
This week, the Falcons face a soft Carolina defense that ranks # 21 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs so this is looking pretty enticing.


Chicago Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

Jim Miller to Marty Booker looked more like Montana to Rice Sunday.   I
don't recall the last time I saw two consecutive bomb TDs to the same player
like that Sunday.   Miller's been up and down but clearly, Booker is a guy
to watch.   Dez White and David Terrell are in the mix but this seems to be
Booker's show.   The Viking defense ranks # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks so it looks like the Bears may be able to
continue to roll.


Green Bay Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

Favre isn't as red hot as he was but he's still a premier QB.   He threw for
262 yards and 2 TDs last week.   He spread the ball pretty well between
Billy Schroeder, Antonio Freeman and Corey Bradford.   Bradford had the big
yardage while Schroeder and Freeman scored.   All 3 are solid plays.   TE
Bubba Franks continues to be a non factor.   The Pack draw a great matchup
this week in Detroit that ranks # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   They rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so
you have to like that.


Minnesota Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

If you'd been thinking about benching Daunte Culpepper, Randy Moss, or Cris
Carter, you got your answer Monday night.   These guys should always be in
your lineup as they're too explosive to sit against any matchup.   The Bears
rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so
clearly, this is a must start for these guys.   The only downside to the
Moss / Carter explosion was that TE Byron Chamberlain was left out of the
party.


San Francisco Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

You don't need me to tell you to start Jeff Garcia.   He's clearly one of
the premier QBs in the game.   Terrell Owens is freaky good and is obviously
a must start.   J.J. Stokes had a breakout game last week so he deserves a
look.   Tai Streets is not a bad reach and TE Eric Johnson is getting more
involved in the offense each week.   It's sort of like St. Louis where any
of these guys are worth a gamble.   Indy ranks # 23 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 25 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so the 49ers are
looking good here.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that should have trouble
stopping the Offense.


Baltimore Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

Does anyone else find the Baltimore's self destruction amusing?   The Grbac
tear thing on the sidelines (which looked like sweat to me) and then Shannon
Sharpe's posturing as the self appointed spokesperson shouting about
interceptions was pretty funny.   Can Brian Billick hold it all together?
Where's Trent Dilfer when you need him?   Grbac will be fine I think.
Sharpe is always a good play if you can stand having him on your team.
Qadry Ismail and Travis Taylor are both decent options as they're seeing
plenty of action and TE Todd Heap even got a score.   Lots of weapons in
this passing game.   They'll be facing a Jaguar defense that's reeling and
beat up.   They rank # 25 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
four weeks.   Jacksonville ranks # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs for
the year.   All in all, a good matchup here.


Detroit Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

A perfect example of how sometimes the NFL does NOT mirror Fantasy.
Charlie Batch is becoming a desirable QB simply because his team is so bad
and he's forced to throw on every down.   Regardless of the reason, you have
to give this guy some credit as he's clearly becoming more comfortable in
the system.   He threw an amazing 62 attempts last week for 436 yards and 3
TDs.   I'll take that.   WR Johnnie Morton led the way with 153 yards.   RB
Lamont Warren had 11 catches but his status is up in the air with the return
of James Stewart.   Green Bay is nothing special against the pass lately
ranking # 22 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they are pretty tough on QBs though ranking # 8 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Kansas City Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

Trent Green had a week off to get everything together but you have to wonder
how much can be done in a week.   Derrick Alexander is supposedly ready to
play this week but you know how that goes.   I'd be leery until I see him
play some.   Snoop Minnis is still nursing an ankle injury and is iffy.   As
always, TE Tony Gonzalez is the primary threat.   Seattle has been below
average lately ranking # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last
four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs
and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New England Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Coach Bill Belichick raised some eyebrows when he announced Tom Brady would
be the starter until further notice.   Great news for Brady fans who'd been
sweating a Bledsoe comeback.   Brady's come back down to earth lately with a
mediocre 185 yard day last week but he's still showing promise.   WR Troy
Brown is by far the favored target and the only real receiver worthy of a
start in most leagues.   New Orleans has been very vulnerable lately to the
pass ranking # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs New England Defense

Aaron Brooks once again offers some vindication for those (including us)
who'd been sweating it after giving him lots of preseason hype.   2 passing
TDs plus another TD rushing Sunday made his owners happy.   I'd go with the
hot hand and keep him in your lineup.   Joe Horn is clearly the WR of choice
as Willie Jackson is up and down.   TE Boo Williams is not a bad reach if
you need a guy there.   He caught 2 TDs and looked good doing it.   New
England ranks # 24 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks but be careful, as Bill Belichick seems to sometimes pull out
something special to confuse young QBs.


Oakland Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense

You have to like Rich Gannon here against the Giant defense that was torched
by Minnesota last week.   Gannon threw for 311 yards and 4 TDs Sunday and
looks as in control of this offense as ever.   Jerry Rice looked half his
age running all over the field and played outstanding.   Tim Brown is as
good as ever.   This team has serious weapons and should go deep in the
playoffs, if not all the way.   The Giants rank # 15 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but for the year they rank # 3 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

Kordell Stewart once again looked like a real NFL QB.   He threw for 266
yards and a TD.   Most importantly, he didn't fold up when Jerome Bettis was
held down.   Hines Ward caught 9 passes for 112 yards and a TD and looks to
be a good play most every week as he's clearly the go to guy.   Tennessee
ranks just # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
They rank # 26 for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so these
Steelers could have a chance to do something through the air here.


San Diego Passing Game vs Arizona Defense

Doug Flutie's magic trick bag seems to be fairly well empty lately.   Losing
TE Freddie Jones last week surely didn't help even though Jones wasn't being
thrown to as much as we'd like to see.   Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham
struggled with Flutie.   This Arizona defense could be the ticket though as
Charlie Batch discovered last week.   They rank # 17 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks but are playing softer than that.
They rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


St. Louis Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Kurt Warner's a must start, obviously.   As are Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt.
Both are outstanding.   Bruce had the big yards Sunday while Holt got the
TD.   RB Marshall Faulk catches as many passes as the WRs, just another
reason why he's the best.   Tampa is limping but they rank # 9 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They do have 13 sacks
over the last 4 games so they're obviously putting pressure on the QB.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Carolina Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Are you really down to starting Chris Weinke?   I didn't think so.   Muhsin
Muhammad could miss this week's game with a shoulder injury.   That means
Donald Hayes would be the go to guy assuming his sore ribs allow him to go.
TE Wesley Walls is always a threat although he seems to be less of the focus
lately.   Maybe he needs to have another ""Keyshawn Fit"" and yell about not
getting the ball enough.   That worked pretty well for him last time.   The
Falcons rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks
but for the year, rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   They rank #
30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs so they're definitely toastable.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

It doesn't appear to be the best thing for the Bengals, but Jon Kitna
continues to air it out.   He threw 42 passes Sunday for 234 yards and 1 TD
/ 2 Interceptions.   The Bengals have about 25 WRs it seems and all are
pretty good.   Ron Dugans got into the act scoring a TD Sunday.   Darnay
Scott is the # 1 but it's a crowded group there making it tough to pick out
any one player.   The Brown defense ranks # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks so you'd think Cincinnati would be able to
throw the ball.    For the year, Cleveland ranks # 5 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs though so it's not like it's a cakewalk.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Tim Couch is winning the ""real"" NFL games even though he's not doing much
for your FF team lately.   His 144 yard / 0 TD / 3 Int game Sunday is an
example of that.   He'll get back on track though.   Kevin Johnson and
Dennis Northcutt seem to be his primary guys with Quincy Morgan there too.
Honestly, I wouldn't count on too much from anyone but Johnson.   The Bengal
defense ranks # 10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks so they've been tough lately.   For the year, they rank # 22 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

Peyton Manning looked solid even with the broken jaw.   Jerome Pathon is
gone for the year and Reggie Wayne's knee is an issue.   It looks like it'll
be his old reliable target, Marvin Harrison.   Keep an eye on TE Marcus
Pollard as he could easily be the best receiver after Harrison.   San
Francisco ranks # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.   You never know when
Manning will throw that monster game though so it's tough not to play him if
he's on your roster.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs Washington Defense

Donovan McNabb didn't wow anyone with his numbers Sunday but he didn't need
to in order to win the game.   He threw for 129 yards with 1 TD.   James
Thrash is still the go to guy with Todd Pinkston worth a roll of the dice in
larger leagues.   TE Chad Lewis was pretty active and caught a TD so you
like to see that.   The Redskins are starting to believe in themselves and
now rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
A dangerous game against the Redskins who have nothing to lose and can play
with abandon.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that could pose trouble
for the Offense.


Buffalo Passing Game vs Miami Defense

As a consistent Rob Johnson basher, Alex Van Pelt kept me from looking bad
by playing extremely well Sunday with 2 TDs and 316 yards.   And he actually
finished a game...   Clearly, he gives the Bills a boost.   Eric Moulds is
still the #1 WR but Peerless Price had a huge game with 138 yards and a TD.
Larry Centers was also extremely involved and TE Jay Riemersma caught a TD.
Miami is hurting without CB Sam Madison.   They rank # 6 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks so they're still tough.


Denver Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Brian Griese just keeps losing weapons.   From Ed McCaffrey to Terrell
Davis, now Rod Smith is limited with a bad ankle.   There's only so much a
QB can do without his weapons.   Smith is saying he'll try to tough it out
and play Thursday but it's very questionable how effective he'll be if he
plays.   My friend (and Denver local) B.J. Miller says his guess is that
Smith will dress but likely not finish the game after re-aggravating the
ankle.  I'd agree with that prediction.   TE Desmond Clark needs to become a
bigger part of the passing game here.   The Cowboys are solid on defense
ranking # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks and #
10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs so it's a tough matchup here for the
Broncos.


New York Giants Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

Kerry Collins threw for 321 yards but couldn't find the endzone Monday
night.   Ike Hilliard continues to improve and actually was more effective
than Amani Toomer.  Tiki Barber remains a strong force in the passing game
and that should continue.   All 3 of these guys are solid starters.
Oakland is very solid lately against the pass ranking # 4 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Seattle Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense

Matt Hasselbeck posted 134 yards and 1 TD Sunday.   With the way Shaun
Alexander is running, that's probably enough.   Koren Robinson and Darrel
Jackson are the primary targets but Hasselbeck is really spreading the ball
around.   Kansas City ranks # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks although for the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs.


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense

Brad Johnson rolled up 399 yards Sunday without throwing a TD.   That's hard
to do.   Keyshawn Johnson remains TD-less which I admit is cruelly amusing.
That'll have to break soon though as he's just catching too many passes not
to score.   I wouldn't be surprised to see him explode with a couple of
multiple TD games as the odds even out.   Johnson to Johnson is really all
there is to talk about with this passing game.   The Rams are solid ranking
# 7 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Washington Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

Tony Banks left with a concussion Sunday but Kent Graham did a fine job
filling in.   WR Michael Westbrook has shown nice maturity this season
hanging in there and now looks to be the quality WR everyone has always
expected him to be.   He had 9 receptions for 104 yards and a TD last week.
The Eagle defense can be troublesome with all their blitzing so it'll be a
challenge.   Philadelphia ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks and for the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs.   Should be a tough game.




/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a very tough Defense posing major
problems for the Offense.


Dallas Passing Game vs Denver Defense

Ryan Leaf did little to impress anyone Sunday with a 102  yard / 0 TD / 2
Interception game.   I can't get excited about anyone on this offense.
Joey Galloway could be worth a shot just for his home run potential but it's
pretty bleak overall.   Denver ranks # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks and that doesn't help any.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

Mark Brunell is looking very iffy again and it'll likely be Jonathon Quinn
again.   (Has there ever been a good QB named Jonathon?)   That's bad news
for the Jaguar WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell although both played
decent last week.   With Fred Taylor out again, Baltimore should have a
field day.   The Ravens rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks but for the year, rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.
I'd shy away from these guys unless I had few options.


Miami Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense

Jay Fiedler looked lost last week throwing for 188 yards, 0 TDs and 3
Interceptions.   He'll have his up and down games but he seems to be
settling back more toward the downside.   His WR corps is solid with James
McKnight, Oronde Gadsden and Chris Chambers but it's hard to put a lot of
faith in Fiedler.   I do like Chambers and his big play ability.   Buffalo
has been tough lately ranking # 3 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   It's actually not so much an issue of them being tough as
it is teams just don't need to throw to beat them.   Regardless, offenses
haven't been putting up a lot of yards on them.   For the year, they rank #
24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

A typical Steve McNair week:   Major questions all week as to whether he'll
be healthy enough to play.   Guts it out through the game, rushing for more
yards than George, throwing for 172 yards and 1 TD.   It might win NFL games
but that probably won't carry your FF team.   Derrick Mason and Kevin Dyson
are both decent players at WR while TE Frank Wycheck remains his best
receiver.   The Steelers bring a great defense though ranking # 2 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   They rank # 2 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs not to mention the fact they've logged 18 sacks over
the last 4 games.   Tough matchup here.

"How (NOT) to speak English Properly","How (not) to speak English Properly

1. Verbs HAS to agree with their subjects.
2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.
3. And don't start a sentence with a conjunction.
4. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.
5. Avoid cliches like the plague. (They're old hat)
6. Also, always avoid annoying alliteration.
7. Be more or less specific.
8. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are (usually) unnecessary.
9. Also too, never, ever use repetitive redundancies.
10. No sentence fragments.
11. Contractions aren't necessary and shouldn't be used.
12. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.
13. Do not be redundant; do not use more words than necessary; it's highly
superfluous.
14. One should NEVER generalize.
15. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.
16. Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc.
17. One-word sentences? Eliminate.
18. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.
19. The passive voice is to be ignored.
20. Eliminate commas, that are, not necessary. Parenthetical words however
should be enclosed in commas.
21. Never use a big word when a diminutive one would suffice.
22. Use words correctly, irregardless of how others use them.
23. Understatement is always the absolute best way to put forth
earth-shaking ideas.
24. Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ""I hate quotations.
Tell me what you know.""
25. If you've heard it once, you've heard it a thousand times: Resist
hyperbole; not one writer in a million can use it correctly.
26. Puns are for children, not groan readers.
27. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.
28. Even IF a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.
29. Who needs rhetorical questions?
30. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.

And the last one...

31. Proofread carefully to see if you any words out.

ARTICLE:
Will the U.S. regulate CO2 from power plants, giving a massive lift to the
fledgling market in the trade of greenhouse gas emissions?

The U.S. Congress continues to discuss regulation of CO2 from power plants
as part of a comprehensive package to address power plant air pollution.
Hearings were convened late last year by the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee to discuss the merits of a four-pollutant power plant
strategy-controlling SO2, NOx, mercury, and CO2 emissions in a coordinated
fashion.

""We used Hotwire for a 4-star hotel in downtown Chicago. The rate was $57/night (I still can't believe it!) and the hotel was fantastic. Now I plan to use Hotwire for hotels whenever I travel. I've told several people about Hotwire and my very positive experience. Thanks!""

<FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2079&key=1321&""><B>Wesley Walls</B></A>, TE CAR - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2079&key=133297&""><B>Martin Gramatica</B></A>, K TB - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Gramatica injured his hamstring in the fourth quarter on Sunday.

Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2079&key=1663&""><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.   </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2079&key=1069&""><B>Steve McNair</B></A>
, QB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2079&key=146325&""><B>Jeff Garcia</B></A>, QB SF - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

, RB SF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Beasley broke his right hand.

A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks. Don't depend on him during the Fantasy playoffs. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2079&key=12431&""><B>Donald Hayes</B></A>, WR CAR - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad. He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2079&key=235174&""><B>Chris Weinke</B></A>, QB CAR - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2079&key=12797&""><B>Kurt Warner</B></A>, QB STL - Hunter <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.

He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=67142.8&random=2079&key=12576&""><B>Randy Moss</B></A>, WR MIN - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts.

Smith was virtually useless on Sunday, running for only 39 yards on 12 carries vs. Seattle. Smith can be productive when he gets enough carries, but he?s a real gamble during the Fantasy playoffs otherwise.<BR>

Boston had eight catches for 84 yards on Saturday against the N.Y. Giants. Boston was held out of the end zone, but he's still one of the best Fantasy receivers in the game. <BR>

Davis had a big game for Washington, posting 146 all-purpose yards against Philadelphia. He was held out of the end zone, but Davis is still worthy of starting consideration in most Fantasy leagues. <BR>

Williams was held to only 41 yards rushing on Sunday, but he did score his seventh touchdown of the year. Williams is a solid Fantasy tailback, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. <BR>

Green had a good outing against Oakland, posting 253 yards passing, two touchdowns and one interception. Green has thrown six more picks than touchdowns this season, however, so don?t depend on him too heavily during the Fantasy playoffs.<BR>

Jones scored a touchdown last week against Oakland, but he's still not seeing enough carries to warrant Fantasy consideration. Unless you're desperate and in a deeper league, there's no reason to risk starting Jones in Week 13. <BR>

Linebacker Derrick Brooks has reportedly ended his 10-day holdout. Brooks, who has been in a contract dispute with the Buccaneers, participated in practice on Wednesday. <BR>

Carney's 11-year run as kicker for the San Diego Chargers might be over. The Chargers signed San Francisco 49ers restricted free agent Wade Richey to an offer sheet Friday. The 49ers have a week to match the offer or lose Richey. If Richey joins the Chargers, he'll supplant Carney, one of the NFL's most accurate kickers. Carney is San Diego's career scoring leader with 1,076 points. <BR>

Wilkins is expected back Sunday from a quadriceps injury that took its time to heal. Wilkins missed five games and most of a sixth. Coach Mike Martz put him through rigorous tests Thursday and Friday to make sure he was ready to go for the game against the Carolina Panthers. Backup Jeff Hall will remain on the active roster until Sunday. ""I kicked a ton of kickoffs, field goals, everything on Thursday and today I did more field goals,"" Wilkins said. ""It felt great. I kicked all-out and there were no twinges, no tweaks."" <BR>

Hi Folks,

Here's how I see the Passing Game Matchups this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheets online at www.footballguys.com  for
exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always
receive emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the
cheatsheet but listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best matchup.   Jeff Garcia
may have a horrible matchup one week but unless you're sitting on Kurt
Warner or Brett Favre, Garcia's your guy no matter who he's lining up
against.   The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool in your box
when it comes to deciding between players.

Note:  I've used the player stats sorted by performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups. Stats are provided by Mike
Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.  http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info.   The points scored by position data is from ESPN.com.
Let's get to it.

Passing Game Matchups to Avoid and Exploit


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.


Arizona Passing Game vs Carolina Defense

Jake Plummer came up small last week with just 144 yards against a hot
Dallas pass Defense.   Surprisingly, David Boston was a non factor with just
26 yards.   Although he still had a ton of balls thrown his way so there's
nothing to worry about.   Carolina ranks # 30 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 22 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Cleveland Passing Game vs Tennessee Defense

Tim Couch threw for 203 yards and a TD last week against Green Bay which was
the 12th best day among QBs last week ahead of guys like Manning, McNair and
Garcia.   Clearly, the matchup helped him out.   Kevin Johnson, as usual,
was his primary target although it was good to see RB Jamel White involved
in the passing game with lots of passes thrown his way.   The Titans have
been awful lately against the pass ranking # 29 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Again,
some people have a hard time understanding what these matchups provide - I'm
not saying Couch will have a great game.   Check the cheatsheet rankings for
where we have him.   What I'm saying is that he has a great matchup here
against the Titans who've struggled against the pass all year.


Miami Passing Game vs Atlanta Defense

Jay Fiedler exploded for 320 yards and a TD last week.   Finally,
Footballguy Favorite Chris Chambers got a start and delivered big time with
124 yards on 7 receptions.   He did tweak an ankle but is expected to be ok
this week.   TE Jed Weaver also saw lots of passes thrown his way.   The
Falcons rank # 31 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Jets Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense

Vinny Testeverde refuses to fade away.   He rolled up 285 yards and 2 TDs
(with 2 Interceptions) against Indy Sunday.   Wayne Chrebet was the primary
WR with Laveranues Coles seeing less action.   TE Anthony Becht produced
another TD.   The Bills rank # 27 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


St. Louis Passing Game vs Indianapolis Defense

Kurt Warner had an ""off"" day for him with ""just"" 217 yards and 2 TDs.   Of
course, he's a must start every week.   The trouble with him is he spreads
the ball around so well, it's tough to predict which WR will see action but
I'd have a very hard time benching guys like Holt, Bruce or even Proehl.
Keep an eye on the thumb he tweaked but he's saying he's ok.   The Colts
rank # 28 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 27 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/

Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong
lately.


Chicago Passing Game vs Detroit Defense

Marty Booker catching 74 yards worth of passes isn't as remarkable until you
realize QB Jim Miller only threw for 98 yards.   I guess that makes Booker
the # 1 WR...   He's clearly the favored option.   This team is all about
Anthony Thomas and their defense though so I'm not too excited about any of
these guys outside of Booker even with the matchup.   The Lions rank # 22 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 29 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Green Bay Passing Game vs Minnesota Defense

Brett Favre made the most out of 139 yards throwing for 3 TDs last week.
He's too good to sit against anyone.   Antonio Freeman and Billy Schroeder
are solid options and Bubba Franks seems to have picked up where he was
earlier this year.   The Vikings rank # 17 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Indianapolis Passing Game vs St. Louis Defense

Manning was back on track again with 228 yards, 1 TD and 0 Interceptions
last week.   The interceptions have hurt him this year but the fact is he's
still one of the leagues best QBs.   Marvin Harrison was incredible catching
nearly everything in his sight.   The Rams rank # 24 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.  Remember, Chris Weinke rolled
over them last week.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Oakland Passing Game vs Denver Passing Game

It's funny when people get excited about Gannon throwing just 249 yards but
that's what's happening.   He's spoiled us.   I'm not worried about him as
along with Jerry Rice and Tim Brown, they're still one of the better passing
units in the game.   Charlie Garner is a nice target too.   This week,
they'll face a suddenly vulnerable Denver team that ranks # 23 in Passing
Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
9 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
WRs.


Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Baltimore Defense

Brad Johnson put together a great game with 3 TDs and 0 Interceptions on 207
yards.   Keyshawn Johnson is of course the receiver of choice and outside of
him, I don't see many other viable FF options.   Johnson to Johnson is the
name of this passing game.   Baltimore ranks # 26 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Carolina Passing Game vs Arizona Defense

Weinke's 312 yard day last week against the Rams was surprising as the Rams
were ranked as the # 9 passing defense over the last 4 weeks going into last
week.   Donald Hayes was ultra active and may need to be again this week as
Muhsin Muhammad is very iffy and TE Wesley Walls tweaked his knee.   The
Cardinals rank # 14 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Denver Passing Game vs Oakland Defense

Brian Griese should be back and ready to go.   Gus Frerotte is out for the
year so Jarius Jackson will be the # 2 guy.   Rod Smith is the only receiver
of note and he's a guy you can never count out.   The bye week helped and
he's reportedly feeling better than he has in a while.   Oakland has
struggled lately on defense ranking # 21 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Jacksonville Passing Game vs Kansas City Defense

Brunell had a Brunell-like day last week with 217 yards and a TD.   Jimmy
Smith is a must start and Keenan McCardell deserves a hard look in just
about any league.   The Chiefs rank # 18 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 12 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Kansas City Passing Game vs Jacksonville Defense

Trent Green put together a decent day with 203 yards, 1 TD and 2
Interceptions.   Snoop Minnis was the preferred WR while Derrick Alexander
did very little.   Tony Gonzalez was fairly involved although not as much as
his owners would like to see.   He's still a must start for TE leagues.
The Jaguars rank # 20 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Minnesota Passing Game vs Green Bay Defense

Stay tuned this week for whether Todd Bouman or Spergon Wynn gets the call.
The Vikings have imploded.   If Bouman starts, it's much better news for
Moss.   If Wynn starts, Cris Carter seemed to be the favored target.
Although it was pretty clear that they were forcing the ball to Carter
because it could've been his last game in Minnesota.   Honestly, it's tough
to sit Cris Carter or Randy Moss regardless of who is at QB.   WRs are
rarely a sure thing.   The Packers rank # 19 in Passing Yards Allowed Per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 12 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Philadelphia Passing Game vs New York Giants Defense

The Eagle passing game is all about McNabb to RB Duce Staley now.   Good for
Staley owners but not the ideal situation for McNabb.   James Thrash and
Freddie Mitchell saw most of the action at WR but they weren't too
effective.   Todd Pinkston is in the mix which makes it even tougher to pick
a WR.   The Giants may be without Jason Sehorn this week which would be big.
They rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 28 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Cincinnati Defense

Kordell Stewart continues to prove his critics wrong as he rolled up 3 TDs
last week and 221 yards.   There's serious MVP talk about him and deservedly
so.   WRs Hines Ward and Plaxico Burress both deserve a look for most any
team.   Burress, in particular, is coming on lately.   The Bengals are
tougher than many realize against the pass lately.   They rank # 7 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 16 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 21 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


San Diego Passing Game vs Seattle Defense

Doug Flutie was awful early, but made a great recovery to finish with 175
yards and 2 TDs with no Interceptions.   There's a lot of talk about letting
Drew Brees see action with the season basically over but one has to think we
would've seen him last week if that was the case.   Either way, Flutie's
probably not worthy of a start except for the larger leagues.   Of the WRs,
Curtis Conway was clearly the go to guy with TE Freddie Jones seeing action
as well.   The Seahawks rank # 9 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 17 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Seattle Passing Game vs San Diego Defense

Matt Hasselbeck hasn't carried many FF Teams this season and I doubt it'll
start now.   He's still a below average player.   WRs Koren Robinson and
Darrell Jackson are the primary guys while Shaun Alexander will be involved
in the passing game as well.   The Chargers rank # 15 in Passing Yards
Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 22 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Washington Passing Game vs New Orleans Defense

Tony Banks threw for 236 yards last week in a tough game with Chicago.
Michael Westbrook and Rod Gardner both saw roughly equal numbers of passes
thrown their way.   He only caught a couple, but TE Zeron Felmister saw 6
passes thrown his way.   You could do a lot worse for a TE.   Plus, he's got
a cool name...   The Saints rank # 13 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong
lately.


Buffalo Passing Game vs New York Jets Defense

Van Pelt put together a 208 yard / 1 TD passing game last week.   As usual,
Eric Moulds and Peerless Price were featured fairly evenly.   This week, the
Bills face a pretty tough Jets team that ranks # 11 in Passing Yards Allowed
Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 1 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to QBs and # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Dallas Passing Game vs San Francisco Defense

I can't imagine you're in contention in week 16 with many of these guys on
the roster.   Quincy Carter's given me very little to make me think he'll do
much of anything.   Of course, for the gamblers, Rocket Ismail or Joey
Galloway can make something happen with just one throw, but they're definite
risks.   San Francisco is ranked # 8 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to QBs and # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Detroit Passing Game vs Chicago Defense

Rookie Mike McMahon gave a valiant effort but it's still very clear he's a
rookie QB.   Granted, he's got talent and potential but he's still very
green.   Johnnie Morton is the WR of choice but TE David Sloan actually saw
more balls thrown his way last week than any other Lion receiver.   That's
not unusual for a new QB to focus on the shorter routes of a TE and it could
continue.   The Bears rank # 12 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the
last four weeks.  For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
QBs and # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


New Orleans Passing Game vs Washington Defense

Few people expected Tampa Bay to start a track meet with New Orleans last
week but that's what happened.   Aaron Brooks had 3 TDs late as the Saints
tried to rally from a big deficit.   Stats are stats though and Brooks
owners will take them any way they can get them.   Joe Horn and Willie
Jackson saw tons of action.   With Cam Cleeland shockingly injured again,
Boo Williams is back as the # 1 TE so that's good news.   The Redskins rank
# 4 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 11 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


New York Giants Passing Game vs Philadelphia Defense

Kerry Collins quietly finished with nice numbers last week.   He threw for
338 yards and 1 TD.   Amani Toomer and Ike Hilliard saw lots of action with
Joe Jurevicius seeing plenty of balls thrown his way too.   The Eagles have
cooled lately where they rank # 16 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 2 in Fantasy Points Allowed
to QBs and # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.   Their blitzing style can
cause young QBs plenty of trouble but Collins' experience should help him.


Tennessee Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense

Steve McNair played a gutsy game last week at well less than 100%.   He
managed 178 yards, 1 TD and 2 Interceptions.   Derrick Mason is still the
primary guy and saw more looks than TE Frank Wycheck which is saying
something.   This week, they'll face a surprising Brown defense that ranks #
10 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 14 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to WRs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong
lately.


Atlanta Passing Game vs Miami Defense

Chris Chandler continued his up and down season with a monster game last
week throwing for 431 yards and 2 TDs against Buffalo.   Terance Mathis,
Tony Martin and Footballguy Favorite Brian Finneran all had great games.
As you know though, these guys are very inconsistent.   This week, they'll
face a Miami Defense that ranks # 1 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed
to QBs and # 10 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


Baltimore Passing Game vs Tampa Bay Defense

Elvis Grbac continues to at least not hurt the offense.   He threw for 181
yards last week with no TDs or Interceptions.   Qadry Ismail is the
preferred target at WR with Shannon Sharpe always threatening to make an
impact.   The Ravens face the Bucs who are hot right now ranking # 3 in
Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 11 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 9 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to WRs.


Cincinnati Passing Game vs Pittsburgh Defense

You pretty much have to avoid all these guys.   Jon Kitna threw for 153
yards and 3 Interceptions.   His most newsworthy accomplishment was a
sideline shouting match with WR Chad Johnson.   Peter Warrick was benched
for fielding a punt on his own 3 yard line.   Warrick should start this
week.   They teased us early , but these are clearly still the Bengals.
Pittsburgh ranks # 5 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and #
7 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.


San Francisco Passing Game vs Dallas Defense

Garcia only had 136 yards and 1 TD (although he was very close on another)
but he's still a must start in my book.   He's too good and has too many
weapons.   Terrell Owens is of course a starter but J.J. Stokes or Tai
Streets could be worth a look.   TE Eric Johnson is still very involved in
the passing game.   Dallas ranks # 2 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over
the last four weeks so they've been tough.   For the year, they rank # 4 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to QBs and # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs.
Tough matchups but I don't see how you can sit Garcia and Owens unless
you're just loaded.   See our cheatsheet rankings for exactly where we see
these guys ranked.

Subject: Jason' Bachelor Party
Date: Fri, 4 Jan 2002 12:36:17 -0600

The time has finally come for us to mourn the loss of another one of our 
fallen brethren.  Yes Jason Bass, my brother, will be getting married Feb. 
2.  So, with that in mind it is time to set up the festivities for the 
bachelor party.

The party will be Saturday, Jan. 19.  I was thinking about taking the 
gambling/drinking cruise out of Freeport (about 30 mins south of Houston) 
called The Texas Treasure (www.txtreasure.com).  The cost should run about 
$50 a person for the cruise - drinks and ""gourmet"" dinner included or 
$35/person for drinks and buffet dinner.  Let me know which one you would 
prefer.  I personally prefer the better dinner.  Gambling expenses are not 
included in the above calculations.

The cruise sails from 7PM - 1AM.

Let me know if you can make it and, if so, what choice of dinner you would 
like ASAP so I can make arrangements.

-Eric

"[Footballguys] Update - Todd Bouman - Spergon Wynn Notes","Entire story:   http://www.startribune.com/stories/510/913654.html


Vikings' Wynn Might Get a Chance To Show His Stuff

Kent Youngblood
Star Tribune

Published Dec 21 2001

Spergon Wynn was making the rounds. From meetings to a one-on-one interview
with FOX TV to a photo shoot.

All the accouterments of a starting quarterback. But Wynn, to his credit,
remained unimpressed throughout. People around Winter Park have been talking
this week about Wynn being more mature than his 23 years. So it was no
surprise Wynn wasn't about to put that cart in front of the horse.

""I still haven't played yet,"" he said, walking from the photo shoot back to
the meeting room; he still had tape to watch. ""Once you see results on the
field, that's when you start to feel comfortable.""

Because of this week's rule of thumb, Wynn might go from prospect to
participant, continuing his ascent up the Vikings' depth chart. On Thursday,
Daunte Culpepper underwent surgery to repair his injured left knee. On the
practice field, Todd Bouman took some very limited reps in practice. The
good news is the swelling in his sprained thumb has stayed down.

""It's not too bad,"" Bouman said. ""It's getting better each day. I took a few
reps here and there, just to get a feel for what we're doing this week. ...
I'll probably take most of everything [today].""

Wynn, meanwhile, took the bulk of the snaps, as he did Wednesday. And while
the decision on Bouman won't be made at least until after the Vikings see
what he can do in practice today, Wynn appears to be edging closer and
closer to his first action in a Vikings uniform.

It's something a lot of people are interested to see. At first glance Wynn
looks like the prototype of a quarterback. He's 6-3, 226 pounds. A good
athlete with above-average mobility. He's got a strong arm and a quick
release; his spirals are tight and his long ball impressive. But, like a
good-looking automobile in a showroom, nothing will be known for sure until
he's actually taken the offense for a serious spin.

And all he got last year in Cleveland, really, was a drive around the block.

Last year as a rookie, injuries in Cleveland thrust Wynn from the No. 3 spot
into the action. He appeared in seven games, starting one. Playing behind a
leaky offensive line, he completed 22 of 54 passes for 167 yards and one
interception while being sacked 13 times. But for Wynn, it showed him one
thing -- that he belonged.

""You have to make positives out of negatives,"" Wynn said. ""The outcome may
not have been what I would have liked. But you learn a lot of valuable
information out there, just playing. I feel more comfortable with myself and
my abilities having gone through it.""

The Vikings liked Wynn enough to trade for him Sept. 3, primarily because of
what he had gone through. Wynn, a native of Bellaire, Texas, originally came
to the University of Minnesota before transferring to Southwest Texas State.
He played in a Bobcat offense that featured the vertical passing game,
throwing for 3,497 yards in two seasons.

The Vikings were interested in Wynn coming out of college, and were
impressed with his ability to adapt to the Browns' offensive philosophy,
going to more of a West Coast attack in Cleveland. They watched as he played
well in 10 starts for Amsterdam in NFL Europe.

Dennis Green, who has done a good job of developing quarterbacks, was happy
to trade a fifth-round draft choice for Wynn and running back Travis
Prentice.

""Any time you trade for a player, the first thing you do is go back to his
college days,"" Green said. ""You want to know exactly what you thought of him
when he came out of college. We liked him a lot. I liked him lot. I think he
has a lot of athletic ability, he's a good competitor, a very smart player,
had the right height.""

No one expected Wynn to play this quickly. But with Culpepper recovering
from surgery and Bouman's thumb sore, Wynn has been preparing for that
possibility, though he has not let his excitement get the best of him.

""Spergon is even keel, all the time,"" said defensive end Stalin Colinet, who
played with Wynn in Cleveland last season. ""But he's a fighter.""

Whether he'll get a chance to fight this weekend remains unclear. Wynn said
the extra reps this week will have him as prepared as he can be.

""I don't think I'll do anything surprising,"" he said. ""But I'll go out there
and compete, make good decisions, put my team in a position to score
points.""


*********** Our View ************

Tough call for Bouman owners.   You know he's dying to get out there and
showcase his abilities.  It's a golden opportunity for him with Culpepper
out so he's surely got motivation to be there.   But they sure seem to be
talking a lot about Wynn.   Hopefully, we'll know more late tonight.

I wish I had something definitive for you but at this point, I'm just
passing along to you everything I see on this.

Joe

Trent Dilfer will start this week in place of Hasselbeck, whose separated left shoulder is too sore for him to play.

Carney's 11-year run as kicker for the San Diego Chargers might be over. The Chargers signed San Francisco 49ers restricted free agent Wade Richey to an offer sheet Friday. The 49ers have a week to match the offer or lose Richey. If Richey joins the Chargers, he'll supplant Carney, one of the NFL's most accurate kickers. Carney is San Diego's career scoring leader with 1,076 points. <BR>

Wilkins is expected back Sunday from a quadriceps injury that took its time to heal. Wilkins missed five games and most of a sixth. Coach Mike Martz put him through rigorous tests Thursday and Friday to make sure he was ready to go for the game against the Carolina Panthers. Backup Jeff Hall will remain on the active roster until Sunday. ""I kicked a ton of kickoffs, field goals, everything on Thursday and today I did more field goals,"" Wilkins said. ""It felt great.

However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play!

Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player.

The time has finally come for us to mourn the loss of another one of our
fallen brethren.  Yes Jason Bass, my brother, will be getting married Feb.
2.  So, with that in mind it is time to set up the festivities for the
bachelor party.

The party will be Saturday, Jan. 19.  I was thinking about taking the
gambling/drinking cruise out of Freeport (about 30 mins south of Houston)
called The Texas Treasure (www.txtreasure.com).  The cost should run about
$50 a person for the cruise - drinks and ""gourmet"" dinner included or
$35/person for drinks and buffet dinner.  Let me know which one you would
prefer.  I personally prefer the better dinner.  Gambling expenses are not
included in the above calculations.

The cruise sails from 7PM - 1AM.

Let me know if you can make it and, if so, what choice of dinner you would
like ASAP so I can make arrangements.

-Eric

"[Footballguys] Update - Steve McNair Still Sore","Entire story:  http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1220/1299353.html

NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee Titans quarterback Steve McNair missed
practice Thursday for the third straight day because of back spasms and is
questionable for Saturday's game against Oakland.

""There are concerns,"" coach Jeff Fisher said. ""He hasn't responded like we'd
hoped. He's still pretty stiff.""

McNair first experienced some stiffness in his lower back late last week. In
the first quarter of Sunday's game against Green Bay, he said the muscles
tightened up. However, he stayed in the game and led the Titans to a 26-20
victory.

Even McNair is unsure of his status for Saturday night.

""If it's like it is right now, there's no way I can do it,"" he said. ""I'm
very surprised. Usually this comes and goes, but this time the spasms have
stayed longer than I anticipated.""

McNair has been questionable numerous times this season with shoulder,
ankle, thumb and elbow injuries. However, he missed just one game, and is
now producing the best statistics of his career.

**********  Our View  **************

Jeff Fisher is probably the least forthcoming of any NFL coach outside of
Mike Shanahan.   Clearly, it doesn't sound good.   But McNair is a guy who
seems to always be a stretch to play and then he goes out and does well (at
least lately)   I honestly don't have any more info that what's reported
above.   It would be my suggestion that if you have a good alternative, you
look hard at him as it's awfully murky for McNair right now.

Joe

Latest NFL Player News

Jerome Bettis <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/08/02
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Bettis will play in the team's Divisional Playoff Game in two weeks. ""There's no question about the next game,"" Bettis said, ""I'll be fine."" Bettis missed Pittsburgh's final five games of the year due to a groin injury, but seems to have healed sufficiently enough to get back into the starting lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=235031&>, RB PHI - The Lie Downs Updated 01/08/02
According to Phillynews.com, Buckhalter will see an increase in playing time behind starter Duce Staley on Saturday against Tampa Bay. Buckhalter, who ran for 89 yards against the Bucs on Sunday night, may even find himself in the same backfield as Staley in certain sets. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1140&>, RB OAK - One Man Show Updated 01/08/02
Starting tailback Charlie Garner is a bit banged up, so Wheatley could see some additional carries on Saturday against the N.Y. Jets. ""He gave us some pop inside, inside the five (-yard line),"" Head Coach Jon Gruden told the Contra Costa Times . ""The physical finish that allowed us to score a touchdown early in the game was vintage Tyrone Wheatley. No question, we'd like to see a heavier dose of the big man as the playoffs begin."" Garner is expected to start, but Wheatley will likely get a majority of the short-yard and goal-line carries. 

Bills <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=4&>, DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Defensive end Phil Hansen announced his retirement from football this week. ""My body and my heart tell me it's time to move on. I've known for a long time now that this would be my final season. I tried to keep it a secret because I didn't want it to become a distraction to any of my teammates,"" Hansen told the Boston Globe . Hansen started his career by making three straight Super Bowl appearances, but he ended his 11-year tenure one day after the Bills worst season (3-13) since 1985.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Thrill Kill Cult Updated 01/08/02
Gadsden, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo with a hamstring injury, will start on Sunday against Baltimore. However, he may be hard pressed to up good numbers against the Ravens' tough secondary. 

Dolphins <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=15&>, DT MIA - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/08/02
Linebacker Zach Thomas missed Sunday's game against Buffalo because of muscle spasms in his neck and pain from a muscle strain in his shoulder. ""I won't be [sitting out] this week,"" Thomas told the Miami Herald. Thomas said he would have played if it were a playoff game, but he sat out so he wouldn't worsen the injuries for the postseason. 

Chris Chambers <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=235203&>, WR MIA - The Guzzlers Updated 01/08/02
Chambers suffered a sprained right ankle during Sunday's win over Buffalo. The rookie now has sprains in both of his ankles, and was removed from the game as a precaution. However, Chambers is expected to play in Sunday's game against Baltimore. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1226&>, WR GB - The Guzzlers Updated 01/08/02
Freeman is nursing sore ribs, but he is expected to play on Sunday against San Francisco. The veteran wideout finished the regular season with 52 catches for 818 yards and five touchdowns. 

D'Wayne Bates <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=133222&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Bates could remain the No. 2 receiver for Chicago even if Dez White returns from a hamstring injury. ""It's something we'll have to look at,"" Coach Dick Jauron said. ""Hopefully Dez will be back and ready to play, and then we'll s! ee! where he is. Dez has done a real nice job for us, and D'Wayne has certainly stepped up and played really well."" Bates has been productive in White's absence, posting 157 yards receiving over the past two games. 

Jason Brookins <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Not So Nice Machine Updated 01/08/02
Brookins returned from a foot injury on Monday night against Minnesota. He carried the ball seven times for 15 yards, and is expected to see an increase in his carries next Sunday against Miami. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=187389&>, K OAK - The Guzzlers Updated 01/08/02
Janikowski will be available for Saturday's Wild Card Game against the N.Y. Jets. He had been dealing with a bout of cellulitis in his foot, but seems to have healed sufficiently after missing the team's regular season finale. 

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Fuamatu-Ma'afala left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a minor groin injury. The injury isn't considered serious, however, so Fuamatu-Ma'afala will be ready for Pittsburgh's Divisional Playoff game in two weeks. 

Seahawks <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Linebacker Anthony Simmons left Sunday's game against Kansas City in the second quarter after suffering a bruised left thigh. He did not return, and was on crutches and had his thigh heavily bandaged after the game. Cornerback Sha! wn! Springs started the game at cornerback, but played only the first series before leaving with a nagging hamstring injury. ""If we had to play one more football game, I'm not sure they could go next week,"" Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 

Eddie Kennison <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1296&>, WR KC - One Man Show Updated 01/07/02
Kennison suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. The injury isn't considered serious. Kennison had three catches for 74 yards in the game, and finished the year with 31 receptions for 491 yards and one touchdown. 

Kurt Warner <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=12797&>, QB STL - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/07/02
Warner was hit in the throat during Sunday's St. Louis' 31-13 win over Atlanta, and has been told not to talk for a week. ""They gave him some steroids, I think, to keep the swelling down, but he's fine,"" Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Warner said he got hit with either or knee or an elbow. ""They just think there's some swelling around the vocal chords,"" Warner said. ""It was tough to call (plays) in the huddle. Guys were laughing at me a little bit."" Warner is fine and will start in the Divisional Round of the playoffs in two weeks. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1294&>, WR STL - The Guzzlers Updated 01/07/02
Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. ""It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain,"" Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game."" Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks. 

Steve McNair <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1069&>, QB TEN - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 01/07/02
McNair missed the second half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to back spasms. The injury isn't considered serious. McNair had an outstanding season, finishing with 3,350 yards passing and 26 total touchdowns. 

Tony Banks <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Banks suffered a sprained right knee in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 20-17 win over Arizona. Banks, who may have played his final game as a Washington Redskin, will be re-evaluated this week. 

Charlie Garner <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1149&>, RB OAK - oops, I did it again Updated 01/07/02
Garner suffered a foot injury during Sunday's 24-22 loss to the N.Y. Jets. He finished the game, however, and is expected to start in Oakland's opening-round playoff game. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=187389&>, K OAK - The Guzzlers Updated 01/07/02
Janikowski missed Sunday's game against the N.Y. Jets due to a bout with cellulitis in his foot. Brad Daluiso kicked in his absence, and missed one field goal and an extra point. Janikowski will be re-evaluated this week, and should be available for Oakland's opening-round playoff game, barring any setbacks. 

Amani Toomer <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1262&>, WR NYG - The Fat Bastards Updated 01/07/02
Toomer suffered a concussion during Sunday's 34-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers. The injury isn't considered too serious. Toomer finished the game with five receptions for 79 yards, giving him 72 catches for 1,054 yards and five touchdowns on the year. 

Terry Glenn <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1254&>, WR NE - The Fat Bastards Updated 01/07/02
Glenn was inactive for Sunday's game against Carolina, and didn't make the trip to Charlotte with the team. According to the Boston Globe, there was much speculation as to why Glenn didn't play. One report indicated New England has already decided not to play him in the playoffs, and another said Glenn had missed meetings. Glenn did have an excused absence Wednesday, when he had to attend to a personal matter. 

Joe Horn <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1511&>, WR NO - The Lie Downs Updated 01/07/02
Horn left Sunday's game against San Francisco in the third quarter with a sprained left knee and did not return. He caught three passes for 44 yards before suffering the injury, and finished the season with 83 catches for 1,265 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns. 

Cris Carter <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1248&>, WR MIN - The Executioners Updated 01/07/02
Carter (ribs) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Baltimore. It is still uncertain whether or not Carter will play, so Jake Reed could see some extended playing time. In any event, the game will likely be Carter's last in a Minnesota Vikings' uniform. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=12400&>, TE KC - The Executioners Updated 01/07/02
Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. ""Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury,"" General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. ""The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look."" Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season. ! Fu! rther tests are expected to be taken this week. 

Mike Hollis <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1387&>, K JAC - North Blvd Nutwhackers Updated 01/07/02
Hollis was benched late in Sunday's game against Chicago after having a first-quarter field goal blocked and later missing his second extra point of the season. Hollis, who is now an unrestricted free agent, is not expected to return to the Jaguars for the 2002 season. 

Marcus Pollard <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1335&>, TE IND - The Guzzlers Updated 01/07/02
Pollard left Sunday's game against Denver in the third quarter with a sprained left knee. He finished the contest with two catches for 11 yards in the Colts' 29-10 victory. 

James Stewart <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1116&>, RB DET - The Lie Downs Updated 01/07/02
Stewart (ankle) played in Sunday's game against Dallas after being listed as questionable for most of the week. The veteran tailback rushed for 69 yards in Detroit's 15-10 win. 

Terrell Davis <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Meximullets Updated 01/07/02
According to the Denver Post , Davis expects to return to Denver for the 2002 season. ""I expect to be back, unless you know something I don't know,"" Davis said. ""I want to be here. I think we'll find a happy medium for both sides. It will be a win-win situation, I believe."" Davis is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent.

Jason Elam <http://football294.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=660&key=1383&>, K DEN - Who's Yo Daddy Updated 01/07/02
According to the Rocky Mountain News, Elam has about a 50-50 chance of returning to Denver next season. ""I've met every goal that I had coming into the season,"" Elam said. ""I'm very happy with the individual season I had. I just wish the team could have gotten better."" Elam is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent.

Latest NFL Player News

Jerome Bettis <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Fear Updated 01/08/02
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Bettis will play in the team's Divisional Playoff Game in two weeks. ""There's no question about the next game,"" Bettis said, ""I'll be fine."" Bettis missed Pittsburgh's final five games of the year due to a groin injury, but seems to have healed sufficiently enough to get back into the starting lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to Phillynews.com, Buckhalter will see an increase in playing time behind starter Duce Staley on Saturday against Tampa Bay. Buckhalter, who ran for 89 yards against the Bucs on Sunday night, may even find himself in the same backfield as Staley in certain sets. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/08/02
Starting tailback Charlie Garner is a bit banged up, so Wheatley could see some additional carries on Saturday against the N.Y. Jets. ""He gave us some pop inside, inside the five (-yard line),"" Head Coach Jon Gruden told the Contra Costa Times . ""The physical finish that allowed us to score a touchdown early in the game was vintage Tyrone Wheatley. No question, we'd like to see a heavier dose of the big man as the playoffs begin."" Garner is expected to start, but Wheatley will likely get a majority of the short-yard and goal-line carries. 

Bills <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=4&>, DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Defensive end Phil Hansen announced his retirement from football this week. ""My body and my heart tell me it's time to move on. I've known for a long time now that this would be my final season. I tried to keep it a secret because I didn't want it to become a distraction to any of my teammates,"" Hansen told the Boston Globe . Hansen started his career by making three straight Super Bowl appearances, but he ended his 11-year tenure one day after the Bills worst season (3-13) since 1985.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Baja Updated 01/08/02
Gadsden, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo with a hamstring injury, will start on Sunday against Baltimore. However, he may be hard pressed to up good numbers against the Ravens' tough secondary. 

Dolphins <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=15&>, DT MIA - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/08/02
Linebacker Zach Thomas missed Sunday's game against Buffalo because of muscle spasms in his neck and pain from a muscle strain in his shoulder. ""I won't be [sitting out] this week,"" Thomas told the Miami Herald. Thomas said he would have played if it were a playoff game, but he sat out so he wouldn't worsen the injuries for the postseason. 

Chris Chambers <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Chambers suffered a sprained right ankle during Sunday's win over Buffalo. The rookie now has sprains in both of his ankles, and was removed from the game as a precaution. However, Chambers is expected to play in Sunday's game against Baltimore. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1226&>, WR GB - Baja Updated 01/08/02
Freeman is nursing sore ribs, but he is expected to play on Sunday against San Francisco. The veteran wideout finished the regular season with 52 catches for 818 yards and five touchdowns. 

D'Wayne Bates <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=133222&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Bates could remain the No. 2 receiver for Chicago even if Dez White returns from a hamstring injury. ""It's something we'll have to look at,"" Coach Dick Jauron said. ""Hopefully Dez will be back and ready to play, and then we'll see whe! re! he is. Dez has done a real nice job for us, and D'Wayne has certainly stepped up and played really well."" Bates has been productive in White's absence, posting 157 yards receiving over the past two games. 

Jason Brookins <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Brookins returned from a foot injury on Monday night against Minnesota. He carried the ball seven times for 15 yards, and is expected to see an increase in his carries next Sunday against Miami. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=187389&>, K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 01/08/02
Janikowski will be available for Saturday's Wild Card Game against the N.Y. Jets. He had been dealing with a bout of cellulitis in his foot, but seems to have healed sufficiently after missing the team's regular season finale. 

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Fuamatu-Ma'afala left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a minor groin injury. The injury isn't considered serious, however, so Fuamatu-Ma'afala will be ready for Pittsburgh's Divisional Playoff game in two weeks. 

Seahawks <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=27&>, DT SEA - Baja Updated 01/07/02
Linebacker Anthony Simmons left Sunday's game against Kansas City in the second quarter after suffering a bruised left thigh. He did not return, and was on crutches and had his thigh heavily bandaged after the game. Cornerback Shawn S! pr! ings started the game at cornerback, but played only the first series before leaving with a nagging hamstring injury. ""If we had to play one more football game, I'm not sure they could go next week,"" Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 

Eddie Kennison <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1296&>, WR KC - FIBSABs Updated 01/07/02
Kennison suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. The injury isn't considered serious. Kennison had three catches for 74 yards in the game, and finished the year with 31 receptions for 491 yards and one touchdown. 

Kurt Warner <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=12797&>, QB STL - Baja Updated 01/07/02
Warner was hit in the throat during Sunday's St. Louis' 31-13 win over Atlanta, and has been told not to talk for a week. ""They gave him some steroids, I think, to keep the swelling down, but he's fine,"" Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Warner said he got hit with either or knee or an elbow. ""They just think there's some swelling around the vocal chords,"" Warner said. ""It was tough to call (plays) in the huddle. Guys were laughing at me a little bit."" Warner is fine and will start in the Divisional Round of the playoffs in two weeks. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1294&>, WR STL - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/07/02
Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. ""It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain,"" Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game."" Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks. 

Steve McNair <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Rocks Updated 01/07/02
McNair missed the second half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to back spasms. The injury isn't considered serious. McNair had an outstanding season, finishing with 3,350 yards passing and 26 total touchdowns. 

Tony Banks <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/07/02
Banks suffered a sprained right knee in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 20-17 win over Arizona. Banks, who may have played his final game as a Washington Redskin, will be re-evaluated this week. 

Charlie Garner <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 01/07/02
Garner suffered a foot injury during Sunday's 24-22 loss to the N.Y. Jets. He finished the game, however, and is expected to start in Oakland's opening-round playoff game. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=187389&>, K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 01/07/02
Janikowski missed Sunday's game against the N.Y. Jets due to a bout with cellulitis in his foot. Brad Daluiso kicked in his absence, and missed one field goal and an extra point. Janikowski will be re-evaluated this week, and should be available for Oakland's opening-round playoff game, barring any setbacks. 

Amani Toomer <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1262&>, WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 01/07/02
Toomer suffered a concussion during Sunday's 34-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers. The injury isn't considered too serious. Toomer finished the game with five receptions for 79 yards, giving him 72 catches for 1,054 yards and five touchdowns on the year. 

Terry Glenn <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1254&>, WR NE - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/07/02
Glenn was inactive for Sunday's game against Carolina, and didn't make the trip to Charlotte with the team. According to the Boston Globe, there was much speculation as to why Glenn didn't play. One report indicated New England has already decided not to play him in the playoffs, and another said Glenn had missed meetings. Glenn did have an excused absence Wednesday, when he had to attend to a personal matter. 

Joe Horn <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1511&>, WR NO - Eric Bass Updated 01/07/02
Horn left Sunday's game against San Francisco in the third quarter with a sprained left knee and did not return. He caught three passes for 44 yards before suffering the injury, and finished the season with 83 catches for 1,265 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns. 

Cris Carter <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/07/02
Carter (ribs) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Baltimore. It is still uncertain whether or not Carter will play, so Jake Reed could see some extended playing time. In any event, the game will likely be Carter's last in a Minnesota Vikings' uniform. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=12400&>, TE KC - The Klap Updated 01/07/02
Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. ""Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury,"" General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. ""The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look."" Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season. Further! t! ests are expected to be taken this week. 

Mike Hollis <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1387&>, K JAC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/07/02
Hollis was benched late in Sunday's game against Chicago after having a first-quarter field goal blocked and later missing his second extra point of the season. Hollis, who is now an unrestricted free agent, is not expected to return to the Jaguars for the 2002 season. 

Marcus Pollard <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02

James Stewart <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1116&>, RB DET - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/07/02
Stewart (ankle) played in Sunday's game against Dallas after being listed as questionable for most of the week. The veteran tailback rushed for 69 yards in Detroit's 15-10 win. 

Terrell Davis <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 01/07/02
According to the Denver Post , Davis expects to return to Denver for the 2002 season. ""I expect to be back, unless you know something I don't know,"" Davis said. ""I want to be here. I think we'll find a happy medium for both sides. It will be a win-win situation, I believe."" Davis is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent.

Jason Elam <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2775&key=1383&>, K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 01/07/02
According to the Rocky Mountain News, Elam has about a 50-50 chance of returning to Denver next season. ""I've met every goal that I had coming into the season,"" Elam said. ""I'm very happy with the individual season I had. I just wish the team could have gotten better."" Elam is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent.

Terrorists Multiplying In The Southeast


The governors of Alabama, Georgia & Mississippi would
like to announce that they have made a disturbing discovery in their
states. Apparently, a small number of terrorists have become romantically
involved with the locals.

The result was not pretty, and we now have the sad
task of reporting a new sector of the human race: ISLAMABUBBAS. So far,
only a smattering of actual births has been reported, and we are hard at
work trying to isolate and seal them off.

To date, we have identified the following:
Mohammed Billy Bob Abba Bubba
Mohammed Jethro Bin Thinkin Bout It
Mohammed Forrest Gumpa Bubba
Mohammed Rubba Dub Dubba Bubba
Bobbie Joe Bubba Charlene Atat
Betty Jean Hasbeena Badgurl
Cleavie Daba Hava Tampa
Linda Sue Bin There Dunthat

Not surprisingly, they all seem to have sprung from one couple:
Mohammed Whoozyadaddy and Yomamma Bin Lovin.

We'll keep you posted.

"[Footballguys] Update #184 - Players in the News","Congratulations!   If you're still reading this late in the season, 
you're likely in your playoffs (and well on your way to winning your 
league...)   We've said all along that it's you guys who make the 
site what it is.  We want to show our appreciation and give you guys 
some due props.   
 
Beginning Monday, we'll be accepting teams for display on our 
Footballguys Wall of Champions.   In this wacky season, making the 
playoffs is a feat in itself and we'll be displaying teams that make 
their playoffs as well as league winners.
 
Here's a chance to boast a little and rub it in the faces of your 
leaguemates who're on the sidelines watching as you battle for the 
league championship.
 
See the site for details.

*******************************************

and now onto the news:



Quarterbacks in the News:

Rob Johnson (Buf) is out.  

Scott Mitchell (Cin) injured himself in Wednesday's practice and
is now doubtful for this weekend.

Cincinnati has signed Scott Covington.  He will backup Jon Kitna this 
week.

Gus Frerotte (Den) has been placed on I/R and is out for the rest of 
the season.  In related news, the team signed Todd Husak for the 
remainder of the season.

Mark Brunell (Jac) is expected to practice on Thursday.  He appears 
on the injury report as probable with a sore quadriceps. 

Daunte Culpepper (Min) underwent surgery and is likely lost for the 
season.  Todd Bouman will start in his place.  He is nursing a 
sprained ligament in the thumb of his throwing hand, but is expected 
to play on Sunday. 

Jeff Garcia (SF) was held out of practice on Wednesday and may be 
rested this week.  He appears on the injury report as questionable 
with sore ribs.  Jeff would like to play, but coach Steve Mariucci is 
considering resting Jeff so that he is closer to 100% for the 
playoffs.  This would seem to make sense since the Rams have likely 
locked up winning the Division.  The 49ers believe they will need a 
healthy, scrambling Jeff Garcia to go deep into the post season.  If 
Jeff does not play, look for Tim Rattay to get the start.    

Steve McNair (Ten), despite being listed on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore back is expected to start.  

*******************************************

Running Backs in the News:

Maurice Smith (Atl) continues to battle through cartilage damage in 
his knee.  He is expected to start on Sunday.  He appears on the 
injury report as probable.

Terry Allen (Bal) will start for the Ravens this week.  Moe Williams 
will back him up and see plenty of action. 

Jason Brookins (Bal) is out and will not play.

Shawn Bryson (Buf) will start this week.  Travis Henry is listed as 
out with a bad knee.  Sammy Morris will spell Shawn.

James Jackson (Cle) is out this week and is likely going to miss the 
remainder of the season with his bad ankle.  Jamel White and Ben Gay 
will both see duty in this week's game.

James Stewart (Det) practiced on Wednesday and likely will start on 
Sunday.

Ahman Green (GB) did not complete the full practice on Wednesday, but 
he is expected to play on Sunday.

Fred Taylor (Jac) continues to show up on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore groin, but do not look for him to play any 
time soon.  The injury is significantly worse than the team has let 
on.

Elvis Joseph (Jac) has a sore shoulder, but is expected to backup 
Stacey Mack.

Priest Holmes (KC) was excused from practice today.  He is expected 
to practice the rest of the week and will start on Sunday.  He 
appears on the injury report as probable with a pulled groin.

Rob Konrad (Mia) has a stiff neck, but is expected to play on 
Saturday against the Patriots.

Jim Kleinsasser (Min) will play through his sprained ankle.  

Ricky Williams (NO) is expected to start despite a hairline crack to 
one of his ribs.  He appears on the injury report as questionable.  

Jon Ritchie (Oak) is expected to play if needed.  He appears on the 
injury report as probable with a sore ankle.

Jerome Bettis (Pit) missed practice Wednesday.  He is listed as 
doubtful on the injury report with a pulled groin.

Amos Zereoue (Pit) missed practice Wednesday.  He is expected to 
contribute on Sunday as a backup to Chris Fuamatu Ma'afala
despite being listed as questionable with a sore shoulder.

Terrell Fletcher (SD) is out with a bad hamstring.  LaDainian 
Tomlinson will carry the running game like most weeks.

Warrick Dunn (TB) will play with turf toe.  He appears on the injury 
report as probable.

Skip Hicks (Ten) is expected to get significant playing time this 
week.  Eddie George will continue to start.

Stephen Davis (Was) did not practice on Wednesday.  He still is 
expected to start, but may be a gametime decision.  He appears on the 
injury report as questionable with a sore knee.  Proceed with caution.

*******************************************

Wide Receivers in the News:

Martay Jenkins (Ari) missed Wednesday's practice with bruised
ribs and a sprained ankle.  He appears on the injury report as 
questionable and may be a gametime decision.

Brian Finneran (Atl) is expected to play despite a sore shoulder.  He 
appears on the injury report as probable.

Terance Mathis (Atl) is expected to play through his back pain.  He 
appears on the injury report as probable.

Peerless Price (Buf) was unable to practice Wednesday on his sore 
ankle.  He is listed as questionable on the injury report with a 
sprained ankle.  If he is unable to go, Reggie Germany would get the 
start opposite of Eric Moulds. 

Muhsin Muhammad (Car) skipped Wednesday's practice.  He will
likely be a gametime decision.  He appears on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore toe.

Bert Emanuel (Det) completed the Wednesday practice and is expected 
to play on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as probable with 
a sore knee.  He has missed the last month and is likely rusty.

Larry Foster (Det) appears on the injury report as questionable with 
a sore thigh.  He was held out of practice on Wednesday.

Terrence Wilkins (Ind) is doubtful with a hamstring injury.  Marvin 
Harrison and Marcus Pollard are likely to get the majority of the 
pass attempts again this week.

questionable to play Saturday.  He appears on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore hamstring.  Rookie Chris Chambers is 
expected to start in his place. 

James McKnight (Mia) has a sore back, but is expected to start 
opposite of Chris Chambers.  He is listed as probable on the injury 
report.

Cris Carter (Min) hinted to reporters that this is likely his final 
season in the NFL.  Of course he said all those things last year, but 
no one is now believing this team is very close to winning a 
Superbowl soon.   

Terry Glenn (NE) is expected to see increased playing time on 
Saturday.

Santana Moss (NYJ) was able to practice Wednesday, but is not likely 
to make a big impact this week.  He appears on the injury report as 
questionable with a sore knee.  Wayne Chrebet and Lavernues Coles 
remain the starters.

Ike Hilliard (NYG) practiced on Wednesday and is expected to start on 
Sunday.

Joe Jurevicius (NYG) practiced on Wednesday.  He appears on the 
injury report as probable with a sore hamstring.  He is expected to 
play on Sunday.

Todd Pinkston (Phi) is expected to play despite a bruised shoulder.  
He appears on the injury report as probable.

James Thrash (Phi) is nursing sore ribs, but is expected to start as 
usual.  He appears on the injury report as probable.

Tim Dwight (SD) is out with Pneumothorax.  And No, I do not have a 
clue what that is.

Terrell Owens (SF) missed practice on Wednesday as he has the last 
few weeks.  He is expected to practice the rest of the week and start 
as usual.  He appears on the injury report as probable with a bruised 
hip.

Isaac Bruce (StL) is expected to start despite a sore foot.  He is 
listed on the injury report as probable.

Jacquez Green (TB) did not practice on Wednesday.  He appears on the 
injury report as probable with a bruised hip.

expected to start on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as 
probable with a sprained ankle.

report as questionable with a sore back.

*******************************************

appears on the injury report as probable.

Aaron Shea (Cle) appears on the injury report as questionable.  OJ 
Santiago is expected to start as usual.

play on Sunday.  He appears on the injury report as probable with a 
sprained ankle.

groin.

Greg Clark (SF) is out this week.  Eric Johnson continues to start in 
his place.

Stephen Alexander (Was) was able to do light running on Wednesday, 
but he is not expected to play this weekend.  He appears on the 
injury report as doubtful.  Zeron Flemister will start in his place.  
Walter Rasby, who has a sore ankle, will also see some action.

*******************************************

successful FG attempt.  Cedric Oglesby do the kicking this week.

Mike Vanderjagt (Ind) is expected to play despite a sore knee.

Wednesday citing personal reasons.  He is expected to practice the 
rest of the week and play on Sunday.

Jose Cortez (SF) worked on making an adjustment to his form this week 
in an effort to improve upon his accuracy.  He is not in any danger 
of losing his job despite poor performances as of late.

"[Footballguys] Joe's Thoughts on Jimmy Smith","Hi Folks,

Getting an avalanche of email on this so thought I'd share my thoughts on
how I see this Jimmy Smith business shaking out.   This is strictly my
opinion here.

First off, I'll stay totally out of the issue of casting any moral
judgements.   That's not my place and that's not why you subscribe.   I'm
only interested (because I know YOU'RE primarily interested) in how this
affects his Fantasy Football status.

I could care less about a fine.   The real issue is whether the league could
take action in the form of a suspension.   It's my opinion that this is
highly unlikely to happen this season.   For a number of reasons.

First, Smith is widely regarded as one of the league's ""Good Guys"".   Rest
assured, the NFL is first and foremost, a business and like any business,
the league takes it's image very seriously.   There's a reason big bucks are
spent on all the (outstanding) feel good commercials featuring players
lately.   Smith is known as a good guy with lots of charity work.   Plus, he
has the amazing story regarding his health this summer.   He's a poster guy.
It's my understanding that this is a first time offense for him.   The fact
that a respected coach like Tom Coughlin is staunchly behind him helps.   By
far, the best Public Relations move for the league is that this be swept
under the rug.

Secondly, there's the evidence itself.   While the NFL has a pretty large
(and vague) ""Good of the League"" directive to work within, the evidence of a
urine test seems sketchy to me.   Especially as it was not administered by
the league.   There is of course the possibility for false positives in such
a test.   An even bigger factor in Smith's favor is that he will not be
charged with any crime.

Thirdly, is the timing.   I doubt the league is in any hurry to throw the
book at Smith.   Any action that might result would likely be something that
is carefully weighed with the ever present thought of the league protecting
itself from litigation.   Therefore, even if something serious were to arise
from this, I have a hard time seeing it happening within the next few weeks.
Not to be too callous about our game of Fantasy Football, but I honestly
care a lot more about this between now and week 17.   I'd be surprised to
see some sort of swift action taken.

Bottom line:   If I were a Jimmy Smith owner, I believe I'd sit tight.
While embarrassing, I don't see a lot of real live jeopardy there for him.
That's my opinion.   If you had a Smith owner in your league who is
panicking over this, I would have no problem letting him believe what he
chooses to believe and maybe scooping up Smith if the price is very
attractive.   Again, just my thoughts.

Thanks to our friend Tom Kessinich from Krause Publications for letting me
bounce some of these things off him.

Have a great week.

Joe

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 


Marcus Howell: Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese 
at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?

G.G. - Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries 
this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle 
injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been 
bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer 
seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But 
remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has 
never been able to string many good performances together in 
the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be 
primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by 
Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post 
respectable numbers at Dallas.

Eric Fernau: Which three running backs should I start?  I 
have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest 
Holmes and Garrison Hearst.

G.G. - Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is 
facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but 
will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside. 
Staley should have little trouble ripping through the 
Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at 
Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon, 
Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.

Jay Rassat: Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have 
Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they 
play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).

G.G. - Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and 
each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play. 
Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of 
a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady. 
With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew 
Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New 
England QB.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not 
have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for 
people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be 
surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a 
great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a 
back like Alexander.

Wall of Champs Is Up!   If you've made your playoffs or won your league, let
the world know about it.   We've got our Wall of Champs up and running and

Hi Folks,

Doing our best to get these to you early in the week as you juggle your
lineups for the stretch run.   Here's how I see the Rushing Game Matchups
this week.

PLEASE NOTE:   See the cheatsheet online www.footballguys.com for exactly
where I rank players and to determine who to start.   I always receive
emails asking me how I can have a guy ranked highly on the cheatsheet but
listed under a matchup that favors the Defense.   Just because one matchup
may be more favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start
the player with the best matchup.   Ahman Green may have a horrible matchup
one week but unless you're sitting on Ricky Williams or Marshall Faulk,
Green's your guy no matter who he's lining up against.  (Yes, even after
last week's performance)  The matchup info is meant to be just one more tool
in your box when it comes to deciding between players.

Stats are provided by Mike Hall's excellent FLM League Management Software.
http://www.fflm.com/ for more info.   Fantasy Points Allowed by position
numbers are from ESPN.com.   Target numbers are from our Footballguy Andy
Hicks.
Let's get to it.

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Locks:  These games feature Defenses that have struggled lately.


Arizona's Michael Pittman vs Carolina Defense

After a few weeks of worrying about Thomas Jones, Michael Pittman seemed to
clearly be the prime RB here last week.   He rushed 14 times for 58 yards
(4.1 ypc) plus a TD.   Thomas Jones, on the other hand, only had 4 carries
for 18 yards.   The Panthers rank # 30 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last four weeks so you have to like his chances again this week.
For the year, Carolina ranks # 30 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Atlanta's Maurice Smith / Rodney Thomas vs Miami Defense

Probably the strongest criticism of Smith you could offer is that he's
losing time to Rodney Thomas...   Smith was ineffective again last week but
did score the cheap TD.   He ran 14 times for 23 yards (1.6 ypc).   Thomas
had 41 yards on 13 carries (3.2 ypc) and did bring a spark.   Smith injured
his toe and even though it's not believed to be serious, it's hard to put
much faith in him with Thomas coming on.   This week, they'll face a Dolphin
defense that's been soft lately ranking # 29 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 17 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.   Make sure to understand, I don't have much faith in
either of these guys so check the cheatsheets to see where I rank them.
It's just that the Dolphins have been very weak lately against the run.


Carolina's Richard Huntley vs Arizona Defense

Huntley ran pretty well last week against a tough St. Louis defense so it's
tough to count him out.   He posted 74 yards on 19 carries (3.9 ypc) plus a
score.   This week, he gets a much softer defense in Arizona that Emmitt
Smith ran over last week.   The Cardinals rank # 26 in Rushing Yards Allowed
per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.


Chicago's Anthony Thomas vs Detroit Defense

Thomas put in a very Bearish workmanlike effort last week with 82 yards on
24 carries (3.4 ypc)   Clearly, he's the kind of tough back this team wants
yet he has the skills and speed to be more than just a grinder.   This week,
he'll likely see lots of action against the Lions ranked # 22 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
26 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Minnesota Defense

Ahman Green bounced back as expected and proved why he's one of the league's
elite backs.   He rolled up 150 yards on 21 carries (7.4 ypc).   He did have
a 43 yarder thrown in there.   He did leave with some breathing problems but
he is expected to be ok this week.   Watch to make sure, though.   This
week, he'll face a Viking team that looks like they've rolled over.   The
Vikings rank # 31 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks
and # 31 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   It doesn't always play out in
real life, but on paper, it doesn't get much better than this.


Miami's Lamar Smith vs Atlanta Defense

Again, Lamar Smith was weak.   12 rushes for 33 yards (2.8 ypc) and a big
fumble.   But the Dolphins don't seem too excited about going with anyone
else so there's always that chance for a cheap TD, sort of like with
Atlanta's Maurice Smith.   I don't have much faith in him but this week,
he'll face the soft Falcon defense that's ranked # 28 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and let the Bills run wild on them
last week.   For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs
so you have to like the matchup.   Check the cheatsheets to see exactly
where we rank him.

New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs Buffalo Defense

Martin put in his typical workhorse effort Sunday with 122 yards on 23
carries (5.3 ypc)   Look for more of the same against the Bills ranked # 23
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 25 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


St. Louis' Marshall Faulk vs Indianapolis Defense

Yawn.   Start Faulk.   He rolled up 202 yards on 30 carries last week (6.7
ypc)   Best player in the game yada yada.   He's the man.   If it matters to
you (and it shouldn't) the Colts rank # 27 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last four weeks and # 29 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.



/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Prime Matchups:  These games feature Defenses that haven't been strong
lately.


Denver's Terrell Davis vs Oakland Defense

Terrell Davis jumps back in the fray after a week of rest.   Oakland's
defense has improved from awful to just bad over the last few weeks.   They
rank # 24 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Oakland allowed
Tennessee's Skip Hicks and Eddie George to run for 87 yards last week so
they are getting better.


Jacksonville's Stacey Mack vs Kansas City Defense

We caught a little flak last week for listing Stacey Mack in the lock column
against the Raiders but Mack helped us out with another 100+ yard day.   He
rushed 27 times for 111 yards (4.1 ypc) plus 2 TDs.   Of course, just to
make you Mack owners nervous, Coach Tom Coughlin said this week that Fred
Taylor could see action this week or next...
http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/122501/jag_8179728.html   I
personally don't see it this week but with this season, you never know.
Kansas City ranks # 19 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 23 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs Washington Defense

Williams owners (like me) groaned when the Saints fell behind so early last
week.   Williams was effectively taken out of the game.   Although
truthfully, he's been less and less a factor lately regardless of the score.
He ran for 26 yards on 10 carries (2.6 ypc) and caught 4 passes for 15
yards.   That's pretty small.   This week, he'll face the Redskins who rank
# 20 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Tennessee's Eddie George vs Cleveland Defense

As weird as it sounds, Eddie George will get the carries this week by
default as Skip Hicks injured his hamstring and won't see action.   The
Browns rank # 25 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks
and for the year, they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Even Matchups:  These games feature no real advantage either way


Baltimore's Terry Allen vs Tampa Bay Defense

Allen looked solid last week with 91 yards on 22 carries (4.1 ypc) plus a
score.   He showed little ill effects of being off and actually may have
benefited from the rest.   This week, he'll face a resurging Buc defense
that's ranked # 13 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
weeks.   That's up from # 21 last week.   For the year, they rank # 10 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Buffalo's Shawn Bryson vs New York Jets Defense

As you know, Bryson went wild last week rushing for 130 yards on 16 carries
(8.1 ypc) plus 2 scores.   He also tacked on 31 yards on 3 receptions.
Bryson did have a 68 yard run which padded the stats a little but they all
count.   Henry will likely sit again giving Bryson another start.   The Jets
rank # 18 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For
the year, they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


New York Giant's Tiki Barber / Ron Dayne vs Philadelphia Defense

Neither RB saw much action last week with Barber rushing 12 times for 47
yards (3.9 ypc) and Dayne only rushing 7 times for 42 yards (6.0 ypc) and a
score.   Barber of course, is more active in the passing game.   This week,
they'll face an Eagle defense ranked # 15 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game
over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy Points
Allowed to RBs.


San Diego's LaDainian Tomlinson vs Seattle Defense

So much for that rookie ""wall"".   Tomlinson rushed 27 times for 145 yards
(5.4 ypc) last week.   Clearly, he's the primary focus of the offense.   San
Diego has a bye in week 17 (that's not really fair is it?) so this is the
last game.   Drew Brees could see some action which probably means Tomlinson
will be even more the focus if that's possible.   The Seahawks rank # 17 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 14 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


San Francisco's Garrison Hearst / Kevan Barlow vs Dallas Defense

Hearst had a solid but not great game last week with 72 yards on 17 carries
(4.2 ypc)   Kevan Barlow carried the ball 6 times for 25 yards (4.2 ypc)
Barlow also caught 3 passes.   He's creeping into Hearst's time.   This
week, they'll face a Cowboy Defense ranked # 16 in Rushing Yards Allowed per
Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 13 in Fantasy
Points Allowed to RBs.


Tampa Bay's Mike Alstott / Warrick Dunn vs Baltimore Defense

It's tough to predict too much with these guys but Mike Alstott was clearly
the featured RB last week rushing for 101 yards on 24 carries (4.2 ypc) with
a score.   Warrick Dunn had 10 rushes for 32 yards (3.2 ypc) and added 46
yards receiving plus a TD.   This week, they'll face a Baltimore defense
that's bark is worse than it's bite lately.   They rank # 21 in Rushing
Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank #
2 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   That just means that lately, they've
given up a lot of yards.   The Tampa backs have been very up and down so be
leery.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downside Matchups:  These games feature a Defense that's been pretty strong
lately.


Cleveland's Jamel White vs Tennessee Defense

Jamel White prompted lots of ""where's he been?"" comments from the Brown
faithful last week as he rolled up 131 yards on 21 carries (6.2 ypc)   With
James Jackson out and Ben Gay still too unreliable, it looks like the Browns
will continue to utilize White.   He'll face a tough Defense this week in
Tennessee that ranks # 5 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 15 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs San Francisco Defense

Smith is probably happy as he got a chance to pad his stats last week with
128 yards on 26 carries (4.9 ypc)   He ran pretty well after a slow start
and being totally and repeatedly shut down at the goalline.   He's clearly
just an average to below average back at this point in his career.   He does
look like he'll be able to hold off Troy Hambrick though.   The 49ers rank #
3 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 18 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Don't discount the
fact Smith is going for another 1,000 yard season.   Of course, with Quincy
Carter at QB, I'd give it to Emmitt too.


Detroit's Lamont Warren / James Stewart vs Chicago Defense

James Stewart re-injured his troublesome ankle last week and Lamont Warren
came in and played well rushing 9 times for 48 yards (5.3 ypc) against a
super tough Pittsburgh team.   (Although he did get 34 of those yards on one
run)   The going isn't much easier this week against the Bears who rank # 9
in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks and # 11 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   Keep an eye out this week to see whether
Stewart or Warren will play.


Indianapolis' Dominic Rhodes vs St. Louis Defense

Rhodes put together another excellent game last week against the Jets with
126 yards on 17 carries (7.4 ypc) with 1 score.   He also tacked on 26 yards
on 3 receptions.   He did have 2 fumbles though.   This week, he'll face a
tough Ram defense ranked # 8 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last
four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 5 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.
Although it should be noted they let Carolina's Richard Huntley run for 74
yards and a TD on them last week so it's not like they're invincible.


Minnesota's Michael Bennett vs Green Bay Defense

Bennett suffered last week from the same problem he's had most of the year.
He just didn't get enough carries to make a difference.   Although one could
argue that after producing just 17 yards on the 11 carries he was given (1.5
ypc), he didn't deserve any more.   Bennett's a percentage guy that'll be
shut down for a while and then eventually break one long.   It's just that
most teams can't afford to wait as long it seems to be taking Bennett to get
going.   This week, he'll face a Packer team ranked # 14 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the season, they rank # 16
in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Philadelphia's Duce Staley vs New York Giants Defense

Duce Staley has apparently forgotten how to run the ball lately but it
doesn't matter as he's clearly the Eagles #1 receiver.   Last week, he
rushed 15 times for 35 yards (2.3 ypc)   But he caught 9 passes for 103
yards.   This week, he'll face the Giants who rank # 10 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   More importantly for Staley,
they rank # 6 in Passing Yards Allowed Per Game over the last four weeks.
For the year, they rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis / Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala vs Cincinnati Defense

Coach Cowher has upgraded Bettis to Questionable for this week and says
he'll play if he's healthy.   Tough to say who'll get the call but one has
to think that if he plays, Bettis will be used just enough to keep him
fresh.   The Steelers are winning without him, have a very beatable opponent
in Cincinnati this week, and don't want to jeopardize their playoff
situation where they know they'll need Bettis.   Plus, the Bengals rush
Defense is tougher than many think.   They rank # 12 in Rushing Yards
Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 7 in
Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Seattle's Shaun Alexander vs San Diego Defense

Alexander looked to be making a statement that he should have been the guy
all along with 96 yards on 28 carries (3.4 ypc) and a score plus another 36
yards receiving with a TD.   He'll face the Chargers this week that rank #
11 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the
year, they rank # 6 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


Washington's Stephen Davis vs New Orleans Defense

Davis was held pretty much in check against the Bears last week with 57
yards on 22 carries (2.6 ypc)   He did get the score though.   He's clearly
the prime weapon here.   How much would YOU depend on Tony Banks?   This
week, he faces a Saints defense that's been tough lately ranking # 4 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 19 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Defensive Slam Dunks:  These games feature a Defense that's been very strong
lately.


Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs Pittsburgh Defense

Dillon ran well against the overhyped Raven rush defense.   As the numbers
showed in the week 15 matchup info, Baltimore's been nothing special against
the run lately.   They were ranked # 12 last week for Dillon and this week,
they rank # 21 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.
Sometimes the numbers tell you more than the reputation.   This week though,
the Steelers rep is backed up with the numbers.   Pittsburgh ranks # 2 in
Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four weeks.   For the year,
they rank # 1 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   This is a MUCH tougher
matchup than last week against the Ravens.


Kansas City's Priest Holmes / Tony Richardson vs Jacksonville Defense

Holmes had a on ""off"" day for him with ""only"" 80 yards on 23 carries (3.5)
and 12 yards receiving.   He'll be fine.   Tony Richardson stole another
cheap TD.   Richardson's a gamble as he won't likely get many yards even on
a good day but he's a threat for a short TD.   The Jaguars have been tough
lately ranking # 1 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the last four
weeks.   For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy Points Allowed to RBs.   I'd
still consider Holmes a must start in most leagues, but this is a tough
matchup.

Oakland's Charlie Garner / Tyrone Wheatley / Zack Crockett vs Denver Defense

Charlie Garner ran well when he ran but as has often been the case lately,
he didn't run enough.  He had 54 yards on just 10 carries (5.4 ypc)   And
most of those were between the 20's.   Zack Crockett and Tyrone Wheatley
both saw action making it nearly impossible to pick which one will do
anything.   The Broncos rank # 6 in Rushing Yards Allowed per Game over the
last four weeks.   For the year, they rank # 4 in Fantasy Points Allowed to
RBs so it'll be a touch matchup.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


That'll do it for the Rushing Matchups.   Passing Matchups to follow.

Hey Bass, what's up? I hope you had a nice Christmas/New Year's.  So, what
does second place pay? and what do I owe for that other league? and I owe
you $40 (20 for the Auburn LSU tickets, and 20 for Texas ending up higher in
the polls than LSU, I'll admit that bet was a lot closer than I thought it
would be at the end of the season, Geaux Tigers!!) So let me know if I still
have any money coming to me or if I'm in the red. Take it easy,
Bryan

"Breaking News:  Xcel Eyeing Merger Partner &  Innogy to Sell Wind Biz"," <http://www.iipower.com/>              BREAKING NEWS  FROM POWER FINANCE & RISK, WHERE YOU READ IT FIRST: 
  _____  

XCEL SEEKS $20B UTILITY MERGER; LOOKS TO BUY BACK NRG 

Xcel Energy, one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., is courting FirstEnergy, TXU and Entergy as potential merger partners and at the same time is looking to repurchase the remaining 20% stake of its unregulated IPP affiliate, NRG Energy, which it partially spun off in May 2000. 

U.K. UTILITY PUTS WIND BIZ ON THE BLOCK

U.K. utility Innogy has put its U.S. wind farm business up for sale and hired J.P. Morgan to find a buyer. The portfolio, which consists of two 20 MW farms in California and a further 600 MW of projects in construction or under development in California, Texas and Pennsylvania, could fetch Innogy some $300 million.

"[Footballguys] News Update - Anthony Thomas Downgraded to Doubtful","Entire story:   http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1123/1283244.html


Rookie Anthony Thomas, who has emerged as the Chicago Bears' top running
back this season, may miss Sunday's NFC Central clash against the Minnesota
Vikings.

Thomas, who has 638 rushing yards and four touchdowns, has been downgraded
to doubtful for Sunday's game with a strained right hamstring.

James Allen, a 1,000-yard rusher last season who lost his job to Thomas,
likely would start if Thomas is inactive for Sunday's game.

This is a crucial game for both teams. The Bears (7-2) need the victory to
stay ahead of the Packers in the Central, and the Vikings (4-5) need the win
simply to stay in the hunt for a playoff spot.


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


It's a dice roll here, folks.   He hasn't practiced all week and James Allen
has been working with the first team.   If you don't have anyone close to
Thomas' ability, you might roll the dice with him but if you've got another
option, I'd probably go with the safer route.   From Coach Dick Jauron's
eyes, I'm guessing he sees Allen as not a horrible choice plus the fact he
wants to get Allen healthy for the stretch run and playoffs.   Just my guess
though.

Joe

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"Hopwaiian Shirt Party Tonight, Lots of Other Good News","Dear St. Arnold's Army: 

Happy New Year!  First, we want to thank everyone for helping us increase our sales 25% in 2001!  It was our best year ever.  And to celebrate, we recommend going out and immediately buying several cases of St. Arnold's.  OK, perhaps that was a bit over the top.  I apologize.  How about this?  Have all your friends go out and buy several cases of our beer!  Thanks again.  Your support truly is important to us. 

The Stout is Out 
Available in the stores, that is.  But you better stock up quickly, because it will only be available for another couple of weeks.  The Spring Bock is lagering and waiting to be unleashed as soon as the Stout is gone. 

Cigar Night II - January 23, 2002 
The first cigar night was so popular that we decided to do it again.  This time it will be on a Wednesday.

Admission: $20 (includes the two cigars)  
Date: January 23 
Time: 6 pm - 9 pm

The Hopwaiian Shirts are Here!  Come tonight and pick yours up! 
After a month of being promised that the shirts were on their way followed by their sitting in Customs for a week, the Hopwaiian shirts are finally here.  For those of you who ordered one to be mailed, they are already in the mail.  For the rest of you, we are having a special ""Come to the Brewery and Pick Up Your Shirt and Listen to Us Say 'We're Sorry' a Bunch of Times and Drink Some Beer So You Won't Be Upset Party"" tonight (1/4).  They made it in time for Christmas - on the Orthodox Calendar (January 7)!

The Julian Calendar New Year Party at Garden in the Heights 
In keeping with our Orthodox calendar discussion, the Julian Calendar New Year is coming, so if you want to relive the fun of New Year's Eve again, come on out. This is still the best European bash in town and the place to ring in the year while dancing everything from the polka and the kolomyjka, waltz, two-step, schottische, frailach, czardas, hassapiko, mazurka to jigs and reels.  The Gypsies will head up the entertainment joined by top ethnic musicians from across the state, a colorful blend of ethnic music and dance from Russia and Eastern Europe. An exotic assortment of traditional Eastern European, Balkan and Russian food and drink will be served. An outdoor bazaar will be set up with craft vendors and a gypsy camp around a roaring fire to ward off the winter chill (in the event of rain, the whole event will move inside the old-world-style Great Hall). 
Date and Time: Sunday, January 13TH, 2002 - 5:00 PM - Midnight 
Place:  GARDEN in the HEIGHTS, 3926 Feagan (One block north of Memorial, two blocks west of Waugh Dr./Heights Blvd.)

does second place pay? and what do I owe for that other league? and I owe
you $40 (20 for the Auburn LSU tickets, and 20 for Texas ending up higher in
the polls than LSU, I'll admit that bet was a lot closer than I thought it
would be at the end of the season, Geaux Tigers!!) So let me know if I still
have any money coming to me or if I'm in the red. Take it easy,

Please use the web site's ""Contact Us"" link, located at the
bottom of every page, for any inquiries.


Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football 
Newsletter! The newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox 
at the end of every week, and will include news about the 
web site; tips on using all the features available; and 
answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron 
Guru."" 


PLAN FOR THE PLAYOFFS

The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are
on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin
with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, 
with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)

If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, 
Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds 
they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not 
determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. 
The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding 
the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your 
regular season. 

If your team is still in contention, go to 
NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes 
during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be 
available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff 
matchup.


GAME-BY-GAME ANALYSIS

Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did
in each game this season. The player's statistics in the 
common categories will be displayed for each game. If you
are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to
see who's been getting the most consistent production.

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 


Mike Blake: I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. 
Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin 
Muhammad in week ten? 

G.G. - Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston 
has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing 
playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from 
a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last 
weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success 
against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with 
Muhammad. 

Russell Brown: My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one 
of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady, 
Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.   

G.G. - Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this 
season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie 
struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and 
won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest 
playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the 
return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in 
his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. 

Chris Gilcrest: Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich 
Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would 
you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, 
Curtis Martin?  

G.G. - Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but 
he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like 
Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar 
performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a 
solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike 
Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the 
matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three 
games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his 
struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit 
is too good to ignore.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay 
healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his 
solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to 
another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best 
Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an 
unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

Vinny Testaverde</b> and <b>Doug Flutie</b>.
</font></p><b><font face=""Arial"" size=""2"" color=""#163786""> 
<!-- Q2 answer title --> 
Answer - GG
</font></b><p><p><font face=""Arial"" size=""2""> 
<!-- Q2 answer -->
Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this 
season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie 
struggled last week against a bad <b>Denver</b> secondary, and 
won't have an easier time against <b>Oakland</b>. We'd suggest 
playing Brady, who will start against <b>St. Louis</b> despite the 
return of <b>Drew Bledsoe</b>. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in 
his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.

Question - Chris Gilcrest

<!-- Q3 --> 
Who would you start at QB this weekend: <b>Rich 
Gannon</b> or <b>Kerry Collins</b>? Which one of these four RBs would 
you <i>bench</i>: <b>Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, 
Curtis Martin</b>? 
</font></p><b><font face=""Arial"" size=""2"" color=""#163786""> 
<!-- Q3 answer title --> 
Answer - GG
</font></b><p><p><font face=""Arial"" size=""2""> 
<!-- Q3 answer -->
Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but 
he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like 
Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar 
performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a 
solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike 
Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the 
matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three 
games against <b>Cincinnati</b>, and is worth starting despite his 
struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against <b>Detroit</b> 
is too good to ignore.

"[Footballguys] Update # 163 11-26  Week 12 Upgrade - Downgrade","Hi Folks,

Once again, our Footballguy Scott Luebke throws out what he sees for this
week's Upgrades and Downgrades.

Enjoy.

Joe

/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Upgrades

QB - Tom Brady - Brady has remains the starter in New England despite the
return of Drew Bledsoe from injury.  Some analysts may question the fact
that Bledsoe lost his job due to an injury, but no one can question Brady's
effectiveness on the football field.  A 258 yard, 4 touchdown performance
keeps Brady entrenched as the Patriots starter.  Keep in mind, the Patriots
have a bye in week 16.

QB - Kordell Stewart - Stewart looked good on Sunday with his second
consecutive multiple touchdown game.  Stewart finished the game with 254
passing yards, 54 rushing yards and 3 total touchdowns.  The schedule looks
good for Stewart down the stretch, especially with games against Detroit and
Cincinnati in weeks 15 and 16.

QB - Jay Fiedler - Fiedler has found a quality weapon in rookie Chris
Chambers.  Fiedler has been an up and down quarterback this season, but his
upside is good.  A quality schedule throughout the remainder of the season
should allow ample opportunity for solid fantasy stats.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van
Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to
match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against
weaker opponents.  Look for another quality performance against the 49ers
this weekend.

RB - Dominic Rhodes - With Edgerrin James sidelined for the season, Rhodes
has been asked to do a lot in the Colts offense.  He produced on Sunday with
147 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  Two consecutive difficult games against
Baltimore and Miami will slow Rhodes down, but a strong finish to the season
is in store.  With Manning and the passing game throwing interceptions, look
for Coach Mora to run a more conservative offense featuring Rhodes.

RB - Antowain Smith - Smith jumps into the upgrades category once again with
153 total yards and 2 touchdowns.  However, now is the time to trade Smith
away.  His value has hit an all-time high and the remainder of the season
will be difficult with Cleveland, Miami and a bye week remaining.

RB - Ahman Green - Green has struggled the last few weeks, but was able to
bust out on Thanksgiving Day with 150 total yards and 2 scores.  Look for
the Green Bay offense to revolve around Green for the remainder of the
season.  As the winter weather approaches, Favre and the passing game will
become more conservative, which will result in more dump off passes to the
talented Green.  Don't be surprised if Green receives 30+ touches/game the
remainder of the season.

RB - LaDainian Tomlinson - Tomlinson's statistics have suffered over the
last several weeks with the opposition focusing on the run.  In order to get
the ball in Tomlinson's hands more often, Turner called several short
passing plays to get LT in the open field.  The plan was successful as
Tomlinson caught 13 passes for 72 yards.  The fantasy playoffs look good for
Tomlinson with Oakland, Kansas City and Seattle on the schedule for weeks
14, 15, and 16.

RB - Garrison Hearst - Hearst looked strong again on Sunday with 106 rushing
yards and 2 touchdowns.  In the last 4 games, Hearst has averaged 106
rushing yards/game.  With rookie Kevan Barlow separating his shoulder on
Sunday to go along with an already injured quad, Hearst will continue to see
20+ touches per game and be a quality fantasy option in the fantasy playoffs
as long as he remains healthy.

WR - Derrick Alexander - Good news for Alexander owners...it appears that he
is 100% healthy for the first time this season.

WR - Eric Moulds - Throughout the week, Moulds was complaining about the
lack of balls thrown in his direction and how the team was using him.  Well,
the complaint department contacted management and Moulds got the ball.  What
happened when the ball was thrown to Moulds?  He produced (196 yards and 2
touchdowns).

WR - Chris Chambers - The talented rookie struck once again on Sunday with
101 receiving yards and 2 fabulous touchdowns.  Chambers is the big play
threat in the Miami offense and should continue to see action.  Keep in
mind, Chambers is a boom/bust option at receiver.  He'll dazzle you one week
and disappear the next week.  This guy is going to be special, so grab him
in dynasty leagues.

WR - David Boston - Plain and simple...the man.  A few weeks ago, the knock
on Boston was his lack of touchdown scoring.  Well, 4 touchdowns in 3 weeks
should quiet the critics.

WR - Kevin Johnson - Johnson jumped back in the scoring column on Sunday
with 113 yards and a touchdown.  Johnson is Tim Couch's clear cut #1
receiver and should remain a consistent fantasy threat for the rest of the
season.

WR - Troy Brown - Brown continues to produce quality numbers on a consistent
basis.  With 7 catches for 91 yards and a touchdown on Sunday, Brown
continues to have a quality rapport with QB Tom Brady.  Keep in mind, New
England has a bye in week 16, so Brown will not be available for the
majority of championship games.  Plan accordingly.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Downgrades

QB - Trent Green - Green's disappointing season continues.  He looked good
with 256 passing yards and zero interceptions on Sunday.  However, he was
unable to throw any touchdowns and that stat leads to the downgrade.  With
the healthy return of Alexander at wide receiver, Green's stock could be on
the rise in the near future.  Green's value is at its lowest point, so you
could probably get him for relatively cheap.  He's not an every week
starter, but he might have a few big games left for this season.

QB - Donovan McNabb - McNabb has looked horrendous in the pocket over the
last two weeks (221 passing yards and 1 touchdown).  His pride of wanting to
be a quality pocket passer is getting in the way of his production.
McNabb's value will be dependent on his ability to scramble and make some
plays. Right now, McNabb should still be considered a top 10 fantasy
quarterback.  However, if his lack of production continues, his stock will
drop quickly.

QB - Brian Griese - Griese's receiving options are limited, which is
directly affecting his production.  Rod Smith limped through Thursday's game
with an ankle injury.  A healthy return of Smith will boost Griese's stock.
However, Griese needs some quality production from the other receiver
position.  His production is limited, if he is forced to throw to the tight
end position the majority of the time.

QB - Daunte Culpepper - Culpepper did not pass/score a touchdown for the
first time in his two seasons as the starting quarterback for the Vikings.
Another difficult challenge at Pittsburgh is upcoming this week.

RB - Anthony Thomas - Thomas was held out of Sunday's game with a hamstring
injury.  He's expecting to play this weekend against Detroit, but this is
not a guarantee.  With James Allen being effective, it would not surprise me
to see the Bears hold Thomas out for another game to ensure a healthy
hamstring for the stretch run towards the playoffs.  A big game looms in two
weeks against Green Bay and the Bears will need a healthy Thomas in that
game.

RB - Emmitt Smith - Smith was held to 9 yards on 9 carries during the
Thanksgiving Day game.  Until the Cowboys can establish a passing game,
Smith's numbers will remain meager.

RB - Ron Dayne - With Tiki Barber establishing himself as the first option
in the rushing game, Dayne's fantasy value has dropped very low.  Dayne had
26 yards on 6 carries.  Barber had 124 rushing yards on 19 carries, 5
receptions for 41 yards and a touchdown.  Keep Dayne on your bench.

RB - Jason Brookins - Brookins broke his foot in Sunday's game against the
Jaguars.  He is expected to be out for 4-6 weeks.  Drop him and add someone
else to the roster.

RB - Eddie George - George's disappointing season continues with 58 yards on
15 carries this past Sunday.  George is currently tied with Randy Moss for
""Fantasy Disappointment of the Year"".

RB - Maurice Smith - Smith sprained his ankle on Sunday and managed to
return to the game.  However, Smith gained a meager 57 yards on 21 carries
and seemed to be bother by the ankle sprain.  Evaluate his progress later
this week.

WR - Jimmy Smith - Smith tested positive for cocaine in his system after
being pulled over by police.  No legal action will occur, but some sort of
suspension could be handed down by the commissioner's office.  Not a good
sign as we head closer to the fantasy playoffs.

WR - Peter Warrick - Warrick suffered a bruised shoulder against Cleveland
on Sunday. He was held to 1 reception for 22 yards and has not scored a
touchdown since week 4 of the season.  Keep him on your bench until the
Cincinnati passing game reappears.

WR - Randy Moss - Moss was held to 25 yards on 4 catches Sunday night.  Moss
is the most talented receiver in the league, but appears to lose
concentration from time to time.  Keep in mind, his potential for explosive
games is enormous.


/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/


Waiver Wire

Keep in mind, the waiver wire analysis selections are based off of 12 and 14
team leagues.

QB - Alex Van Pelt - Since stepping into the lineup for Rob Johnson, Van
Pelt has been a fantasy star.  With two consecutive 300+ yards games to
match with 5 touchdowns, Van Pelt deserves starter consideration against
weaker opponents.

RB - James Allen - Allen stepped in for the injured Anthony Thomas and
performed admirably.  With Thomas bothered by a hamstring injury, it's
highly possible that Allen could start against the lowly Detroit Lions this
weekend.  Chicago's defense is strong and the Bears like to grind it out on
the ground.

RB - Travis Minor - With Lamar Smith averaging just 2.3 yds/carry over the
last 6 games, Minor may be given his opportunity to shine very soon.  In his
limited touches, Minor has looked good and could give the Dolphins offense a
much needed spark.

WR - Chris Chambers - This guy is good.  See description in upgrades
section.

TE - Eddie ""Boo"" Williams - I had Williams on the list last week and his
play on Sunday deserves another mention.  Although he had just 2 catches for
44 yards, Williams has explosive potential.  He nearly scored on a 25 yard
pass play, but had the ball ripped out of his hands at the last second.
With Cam Cleeland remaining out with an injury, Williams is a tight end with
quality upside.

"An important message from Newsmax","Dear Americans,

Here's another great forward from Newsmax.  Check it out.

For America,

Bruce Eberle

-----Original Message-----

Book that predicted attacks, economic slump, has MORE
WARNINGS . . .

This New Book Tells the Whole Story About Bill & Hillary

Just before Bill and Hillary Clinton left the White House
NewsMax published ""Bitter Legacy: The Untold Story of the
Clinton-Gore Years."" Edited by journalists NewsMax's Chris
Ruddy and Carl Limbacher, ""Bitter Legacy"" was about the
Clinton years -- and a grave warning about the future.

As you know, NewsMax.com is the leading online news service
for thinking conservatives. You've heard of us on Rush
Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, Mike Reagan, Mike Savage and Sean
Hannity.

Already NewsMax's book ""Bitter Legacy"" has become an
internet best-seller, with more than 50,000 copies sold and
growing. Now ""Bitter Legacy"" is viewed as ""prophetic."" One
reader wrote to us, ""This is the best book on the Clinton
years I have ever read. It also has been a great road map
for the future. You've been proven right already.""

""Bitter Legacy"" predicted America would pay the bill for the
Clintons after they left the White House.

""Bitter Legacy"" said America would become vulnerable to
foreign attack, and that foreign crises would dominate this
current administration.

""Bitter Legacy"" showed how the Clinton White House and Alan
Greenspan built the U.S. economy on a house of cards -- and
that an economic fallout would most assuredly happen.

On both counts, NewsMax was right!

You need to get a copy of ""Bitter Legacy"" today and read its
important predictions about Hillary, future wars and the
economy. Also check out our FREE offer to get ""Bitter
Legacy"" free with a one-year subscription to NewsMax
magazine.

Michael Reagan says NewsMax and NewsMax magazine are his
favorite news sources. He said, ""I guarantee you'll love
NewsMax magazine."" NewsMax magazine you'll read Chris Ruddy,
Bill O'Reilly, David Limbaugh, Mike Reagan, Mike Savage and
many others.

Take advantage of this incredible offer: Order NewsMax
magazine and get ""Bitter Legacy"" for FREE.

ROCKETS GUARD TO SHARE BACKCOURT WITH BRYANT 

  <http://origin.nba.com/media/allstar2002/francis_drive_020125.jpg>Jan. 26 - Houston Rockets guard Steve Francis today was named as a starter for the Western Conference in the 2002 NBA All-Star Game to be played in Philadelphia on February 10. 

Francis will join Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant in the backcourt along with Tim Duncan of the Spurs, L.A.'s Shaquille O'Neal and Kevin Garnett of the Timberwolves in the Western Conference frontcourt.

The Rockets point guard, who will be making his inaugural All-Star appearance, held the second position among Western Conference guards when the first returns of the 2002 All-Star balloting were announced last month. He maintained that position throughout the process, easily outdistancing Seattle's Gary Payton for the starting nod.

  some accounting and billing, but i'm working in the commercial group doing
advertising and support to the engineers for the most part.  the company is

great, we just celebrated 15 years of business last month. it is a small
firm, and many of the staff members are pretty young, i am still the
youngest, however.  i found the job online, and i liked it after the first
interview.

my sisters are doing great, jacqui is a senior at lamar, and dominique is
working towards her last year of school and then she has a year of student
teaching. she has been dating hunter sage for almost 3 years now.  he is in

his first year of law school at UT.  jacqui's boyfriend of a year and 2
months (they celebrated last week) is also a senior at lamar.  really great

guy! i think when i buy the townhouse, dominique will probably move in with

me, her student teaching is unpaid, so she will be looking for a free
place,
i'm sure.  jacqui is not sure about next year, she wanted to go to art
school in new york, and my family took a vacation there in august of this
year, but now with everything going on, she is not sure.  i think i may
start taking some graduate classes next fall at U of H, but i'm still
researching what i want to study.  any vacations for you recently?

i'm really glad you wrote me back, i've been thinking about you and
wondering what you have been doing for a while.  take care.

"PROS Natural Gas Trading Profit Optimization Web Seminar","For Immediate Release
 

Last Chance to Register for 


Profit Optimization Web Seminar on Natural Gas Trading

 
February 4, 2002-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in pricing and revenue optimization science and software, will host an Energy Profit Optimization Web Seminar for natural gas trading on February 7, 2002, 3:00 - 4:00pm Central Time.  This is the last chance to register.
 
The PROS Trading Optimization System utilizes PROS network optimization technology to optimally schedule natural gas volumes to market across multiple pipelines and provide buy/sell recommendations that maximize the revenue and utilization from all transportation assets.  In addition to the 10-15% profitability lift from optimal gas scheduling, the system also completely automates the scheduling process.  The PROS Trading Optimization System has been in live use since 2000.  Version 2.0 of the TOS system has been completely parameterized allowing companies to dynamically configure the system for multiple unique pipeline trading strategies and tariffs.  The result is the reduction of the gas scheduling process to less than 60 seconds.
 
These seminars will cover the basics of increasing revenues and profits while providing insight on how real-time data can be used to optimize profits.  The Web format will allow participants to attend from remote locations, ask questions in real-time, and interact with the presenter through an Internet browser and toll-free telephone number.  Participants of previous PROS seminars have found these sessions to be extremely helpful in improving their business and making them more valuable to their respective organizations.
 
PROS Revenue Management solutions have been credited with delivering 6-8% incremental revenue and 20-100% incremental profits.  These Web seminars will allow industry leaders to learn from the experience PROS has gained in over 17 years of deploying these solutions.
 
This seminar is free of charge, spaces are limited for a first come first served basis.  More information and registration can be found at: www.prosRM.com <http://www.prosrm.com/>.  Interested participants will be contacted to receive conference access information.

Warrick is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers. He was taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of Cincinnati's Week 11 loss to the Browns.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1847&""><B>Jon Kitna</B></A>, QB CIN - The Snake Pit <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/26/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched at halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game.

The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=192266&""><B>Jason Brookins</B></A>, RB BAL - Not So Nice Machine <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble.

Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego?s 20-17 loss. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=12375&""><B>Doug Flutie</B></A>, QB SD - Thrill Kill Cult <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona.

Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1511&""><B>Joe Horn</B></A>, WR NO - The Lie Downs <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He?s been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1140&""><B>Tyrone Wheatley</B></A>, RB OAK - One Man Show <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five t!

Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He?s become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots? bench for another week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1034&""><B>Rich Gannon</B></A>, QB OAK - The Executioners <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants.

He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=1011&""><B>Alex Van Pelt</B></A>, QB BUF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helve!

Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception.

He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football212.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=kourn&owner=53402&random=2884&key=12363&""><B>Jay Fiedler</B></A>, QB MIA - Meximullets <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and n!

Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington.

In a supermarket, Kurtis the stock boy, was busily working when a new voice came over the asking for a carry out at check register 4.  Kurtis was almost finished, and 
wanted to get some fresh air, and decided to answer the call.  As he approached the check-out stand a 
distant smile caught his eye, the new check out girl was beautiful.  She was an older woman (maybe 
26, and he was only 22) and he fell in love.

Later that day, after his shift was over, he waited by the punch clock to find out her name.  She came into the break room, smiled softly at him and took her card and 
punched out, then left.  He looked at her card, BRENDA.  He walked out only to see her start walking up
the road.

Next day, he waited outside as she left the supermarket, and offered her a ride home.  He looked
harmless enough, and she accepted.  When he dropped her off, he asked if maybe he could see her
again, outside of work.  She simply said it wasn't possible.  He pressed and she explained she had
two children and she couldn't afford a baby-sitter, so he offered to pay for the baby-sitter.
Reluctantly she accepted his offer for a date for the following Saturday.

That Saturday night he arrived at her door only to have her tell him that she was unable to go with
him.  The baby-sitter had called and canceled.  To which Kurtis simply said, ""Well, lets take the
kids with us.""

She tried to explain that taking the children was not an option, but again not taking no for an
answer, he pressed.  Finally Brenda, brought him inside to meet her children.  She had an older
daughter who was just cute a bug, Kurtis thought, then Brenda brought out her son, in a wheelchair,
he was born a paraplegic with down syndrome.  Kurtis asked Brenda, ""I still don't understand why the
kids can't come with us?""  Brenda was amazed.  Most men would run away 
from a woman with two kids, especially if one had disabilities.  Just like her first husband and 
father of her children did.

That evening Kurtis and Brenda loaded up the kids, went to dinner and the movies.  When her son
needed anything Kurtis would take care of him.  When he needed to use the rest room, he picked him
up out of his chair, took him, brought him back.  The kids loved Kurtis.  At the end of the evening,
Brenda knew this was the man she was going to marry and spend the rest of her life with.
A year later, they were married and Kurtis adopted both of her children and since they have added two more
kids.

So what happened to the stock boy and check out girl?
Well, Mr. & Mrs. Kurt Warner, now live in St. Louis, where he is employed by the St. Louis Rams and plays 
quarterback.

including synergies with hybrid automobiles and the potentially lucrative
APU market.

"Inside The Rockets - November 19, 2001","Dear eric,




ROCKETS 5-GAME OUTLOOK 

The Rockets kick off a four-game West Coast road trip tonight in Sacramento. Other stops include Portland (Tuesday), Seattle (Friday) and L.A. to take on the Clippers (Sunday). Houston will then return home Tuesday, November 27 to host the Kings.

Or details about the next five games, check out the Rockets 5-Game Outlook (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=134695&UID=45456540&MID=188637). 

 

ROCKETS ACTIVATE DAN LANGHI

The Houston Rockets have placed guard Tierre Brown on the injured list with plantar fasciitis of the left foot, General Manager Carroll Dawson has announced. In a related move, the Rockets activated forward Dan Langhi from the injured list.

Brown has seen action in one regular season game, recording two points and three assists while making his NBA debut at Denver on Nov. 9. The 6-foot-2, 189-pound rookie averaged 4.0 points and 2.3 assists for Houston in four preseason games. The McNeese State product received All-Southland Conference honors following each of the last two college basketball seasons.

Langhi has been sidelined for Houston's first nine games with a right ankle sprain. The 6-foot-11, 22-0 pound forward averaged 5.8 points and 1.8 rebounds in five Rockets preseason games. Langhi averaged 2.7 points and 1.2 rebounds as a rookie last year after being named the 2000 Southeastern Conference Player of the Year with Vanderbilt the previous season.

MO' BETTA BUNCH

Houston Rockets forward Maurice Taylor (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=134697&UID=45456540&MID=188637) has purchased 40 regular season tickets and will donate all of the seats to local non-profit community groups that serve underprivileged children. Taylor plans to make the Rockets home game seats available to the community groups throughout the remainder of the 2001-2002 NBA season. Appropriately dubbed the ""Mo'Betta Bunch,"" Taylor's charitable endeavor will touch the lives of
more than 1,400 children in the Houston area. 

Each ""Mo' Betta Bunch"" group attending a Rockets home game will receive reserved seating in Compaq Center, designated with a special, brightly colored banner, and an exclusive, red T-shirt sporting Taylor's name and Rockets jersey number. Schedule permitting, Taylor intends to personally welcome each ""Mo' Betta Bunch"" group to the game prior to tipoff.

""I am very pleased to have the opportunity to help our deserving youth and provide a Rockets game experience,"" said Taylor. ""Having the ability to touch so many young lives and make a positive impact is truly rewarding.""

The Rockets Community Services Department will be responsible for selection of groups to participate in ""Mo' Betta Bunch"" and the distribution of tickets and T-shirts. 

The goal of Taylor's ticket donation program is to help non-profit groups who are already making a difference in the lives of children, but who lack the finances to provide extra-curricular activities.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Latest NFL Player News

Jerome Bettis <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Fear Updated 01/08/02
According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Bettis will play in the team's Divisional Playoff Game in two weeks. ""There's no question about the next game,"" Bettis said, ""I'll be fine."" Bettis missed Pittsburgh's final five games of the year due to a groin injury, but seems to have healed sufficiently enough to get back into the starting lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to Phillynews.com, Buckhalter will see an increase in playing time behind starter Duce Staley on Saturday against Tampa Bay. Buckhalter, who ran for 89 yards against the Bucs on Sunday night, may even find himself in the same backfield as Staley in certain sets. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/08/02
Starting tailback Charlie Garner is a bit banged up, so Wheatley could see some additional carries on Saturday against the N.Y. Jets. ""He gave us some pop inside, inside the five (-yard line),"" Head Coach Jon Gruden told the Contra Costa Times . ""The physical finish that allowed us to score a touchdown early in the game was vintage Tyrone Wheatley. No question, we'd like to see a heavier dose of the big man as the playoffs begin."" Garner is expected to start, but Wheatley will likely get a majority of the short-yard and goal-line carries. 

Bills <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=4&>, DT BUF - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Defensive end Phil Hansen announced his retirement from football this week. ""My body and my heart tell me it's time to move on. I've known for a long time now that this would be my final season. I tried to keep it a secret because I didn't want it to become a distraction to any of my teammates,"" Hansen told the Boston Globe . Hansen started his career by making three straight Super Bowl appearances, but he ended his 11-year tenure one day after the Bills worst season (3-13) since 1985.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Baja Updated 01/08/02
Gadsden, who missed Sunday's game against Buffalo with a hamstring injury, will start on Sunday against Baltimore. However, he may be hard pressed to up good numbers against the Ravens' tough secondary. 

Dolphins <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=15&>, DT MIA - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/08/02
Linebacker Zach Thomas missed Sunday's game against Buffalo because of muscle spasms in his neck and pain from a muscle strain in his shoulder. ""I won't be [sitting out] this week,"" Thomas told the Miami Herald. Thomas said he would have played if it were a playoff game, but he sat out so he wouldn't worsen the injuries for the postseason. 

Chris Chambers <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Chambers suffered a sprained right ankle during Sunday's win over Buffalo. The rookie now has sprains in both of his ankles, and was removed from the game as a precaution. However, Chambers is expected to play in Sunday's game against Baltimore. 

Antonio Freeman <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1226&>, WR GB - Baja Updated 01/08/02
Freeman is nursing sore ribs, but he is expected to play on Sunday against San Francisco. The veteran wideout finished the regular season with 52 catches for 818 yards and five touchdowns. 

D'Wayne Bates <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=133222&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Bates could remain the No. 2 receiver for Chicago even if Dez White returns from a hamstring injury. ""It's something we'll have to look at,"" Coach Dick Jauron said. ""Hopefully Dez will be back and ready to play, and then we'll see whe! re! he is. Dez has done a real nice job for us, and D'Wayne has certainly stepped up and played really well."" Bates has been productive in White's absence, posting 157 yards receiving over the past two games. 

Jason Brookins <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 01/08/02
Brookins returned from a foot injury on Monday night against Minnesota. He carried the ball seven times for 15 yards, and is expected to see an increase in his carries next Sunday against Miami. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=187389&>, K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 01/08/02
Janikowski will be available for Saturday's Wild Card Game against the N.Y. Jets. He had been dealing with a bout of cellulitis in his foot, but seems to have healed sufficiently after missing the team's regular season finale. 

Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=12384&>, RB PIT - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Fuamatu-Ma'afala left Sunday's game against Cleveland with a minor groin injury. The injury isn't considered serious, however, so Fuamatu-Ma'afala will be ready for Pittsburgh's Divisional Playoff game in two weeks. 

Seahawks <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=27&>, DT SEA - Baja Updated 01/07/02
Linebacker Anthony Simmons left Sunday's game against Kansas City in the second quarter after suffering a bruised left thigh. He did not return, and was on crutches and had his thigh heavily bandaged after the game. Cornerback Shawn S! pr! ings started the game at cornerback, but played only the first series before leaving with a nagging hamstring injury. ""If we had to play one more football game, I'm not sure they could go next week,"" Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 

Eddie Kennison <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1296&>, WR KC - FIBSABs Updated 01/07/02
Kennison suffered an ankle injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. The injury isn't considered serious. Kennison had three catches for 74 yards in the game, and finished the year with 31 receptions for 491 yards and one touchdown. 

Kurt Warner <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=12797&>, QB STL - Baja Updated 01/07/02
Warner was hit in the throat during Sunday's St. Louis' 31-13 win over Atlanta, and has been told not to talk for a week. ""They gave him some steroids, I think, to keep the swelling down, but he's fine,"" Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Warner said he got hit with either or knee or an elbow. ""They just think there's some swelling around the vocal chords,"" Warner said. ""It was tough to call (plays) in the huddle. Guys were laughing at me a little bit."" Warner is fine and will start in the Divisional Round of the playoffs in two weeks. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1294&>, WR STL - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/07/02
Bruce left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the first quarter due to a lower back sprain. ""It doesn't appear to be anything more than a sprain,"" Head Coach Mike Martz told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. ""So having a week off will obviously help us with Isaac. He could have probably come right back in this game."" Bruce is expected to be ready when St. Louis plays their first playoff game in two weeks. 

Steve McNair <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Rocks Updated 01/07/02
McNair missed the second half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to back spasms. The injury isn't considered serious. McNair had an outstanding season, finishing with 3,350 yards passing and 26 total touchdowns. 

Tony Banks <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/07/02
Banks suffered a sprained right knee in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 20-17 win over Arizona. Banks, who may have played his final game as a Washington Redskin, will be re-evaluated this week. 

Charlie Garner <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Hunter Shively Updated 01/07/02
Garner suffered a foot injury during Sunday's 24-22 loss to the N.Y. Jets. He finished the game, however, and is expected to start in Oakland's opening-round playoff game. 

Sebastian Janikowski <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=187389&>, K OAK - McKay Neal Updated 01/07/02
Janikowski missed Sunday's game against the N.Y. Jets due to a bout with cellulitis in his foot. Brad Daluiso kicked in his absence, and missed one field goal and an extra point. Janikowski will be re-evaluated this week, and should be available for Oakland's opening-round playoff game, barring any setbacks. 

Amani Toomer <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1262&>, WR NYG - McKay Neal Updated 01/07/02
Toomer suffered a concussion during Sunday's 34-25 loss to the Green Bay Packers. The injury isn't considered too serious. Toomer finished the game with five receptions for 79 yards, giving him 72 catches for 1,054 yards and five touchdowns on the year. 

Terry Glenn <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1254&>, WR NE - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/07/02
Glenn was inactive for Sunday's game against Carolina, and didn't make the trip to Charlotte with the team. According to the Boston Globe, there was much speculation as to why Glenn didn't play. One report indicated New England has already decided not to play him in the playoffs, and another said Glenn had missed meetings. Glenn did have an excused absence Wednesday, when he had to attend to a personal matter. 

Joe Horn <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1511&>, WR NO - Eric Bass Updated 01/07/02
Horn left Sunday's game against San Francisco in the third quarter with a sprained left knee and did not return. He caught three passes for 44 yards before suffering the injury, and finished the season with 83 catches for 1,265 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns. 

Cris Carter <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1248&>, WR MIN - Matt Lenhart Updated 01/07/02
Carter (ribs) is listed as probable for Monday's game against Baltimore. It is still uncertain whether or not Carter will play, so Jake Reed could see some extended playing time. In any event, the game will likely be Carter's last in a Minnesota Vikings' uniform. 

Tony Gonzalez <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=12400&>, TE KC - The Klap Updated 01/07/02
Gonzalez suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Seattle. ""Right now, it's still hard to tell the extent of the injury,"" General Manager Peterson told the Kansas City Star. ""The MCL is loose. The rest of it doesn't seem to be a real concern. But I'm saying that without giving it a good look."" Although the injury will keep Gonzalez out of the Pro Bowl, it shouldn't keep him from being ready for the start of the 2002 season. Further! t! ests are expected to be taken this week. 

Mike Hollis <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1387&>, K JAC - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/07/02
Hollis was benched late in Sunday's game against Chicago after having a first-quarter field goal blocked and later missing his second extra point of the season. Hollis, who is now an unrestricted free agent, is not expected to return to the Jaguars for the 2002 season. 

Marcus Pollard <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 01/07/02
Pollard left Sunday's game against Denver in the third quarter with a sprained left knee. He finished the contest with two catches for 11 yards in the Colts' 29-10 victory. 

James Stewart <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1116&>, RB DET - Tori Kuykendall Updated 01/07/02
Stewart (ankle) played in Sunday's game against Dallas after being listed as questionable for most of the week. The veteran tailback rushed for 69 yards in Detroit's 15-10 win. 

Terrell Davis <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Eric Bass Updated 01/07/02
According to the Denver Post , Davis expects to return to Denver for the 2002 season. ""I expect to be back, unless you know something I don't know,"" Davis said. ""I want to be here. I think we'll find a happy medium for both sides. It will be a win-win situation, I believe."" Davis is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent.

Jason Elam <http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ene&owner=45547.3&random=2630&key=1383&>, K DEN - Hunter Shively Updated 01/07/02
According to the Rocky Mountain News, Elam has about a 50-50 chance of returning to Denver next season. ""I've met every goal that I had coming into the season,"" Elam said. ""I'm very happy with the individual season I had. I just wish the team could have gotten better."" Elam is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent.

"[Footballguys] Breaking News - Correll Buckhalter Trouble","Entire story:  http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2001/1117/1279805.html


Leading rusher Correll Buckhalter is among three rookie players suspended
for one game by Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid on Saturday after a
Friday night incident in which the trio was taken into custody on possible
drug charges.

None of the players will participate in Sunday's game at Dallas, nor will
they be allowed to even make the trip, as the result of the team action.

ESPN.com has learned that safety Terrence Carroll, an undrafted free agent
from Oregon State, is the only one of the players who will be charged. The
players were stopped Friday night as they drove on South Street, a trendy
area of shops and clubs, and police detected an odor of marijuana.

Carroll is expected to be charged with marijuana possession and he remains
in custody pending bond. Buckhalter and cornerback Darrel Crutchfield, an
undrafted free agent from Clemson, were released on Saturday morning and
will not face charges. Carroll was to have been deactivated for the game at
Dallas and might not have made the trip anyway.

""We are obviously aware of the incident involving three of our first-year
players last night in Philadelphia,"" said Reid in a statement released by
the club. ""I've met with the players that I could meet with this morning and
they will be suspended for this Sunday's game. . . . We will not have any
further comment on this matter and we will handle the rest of this situation
internally.""

The players will each be docked $12,294, the equivalent of one game check
based on their rookie minimum base salaries of $209,000. More significant
for Carroll is that he almost certainly will be in violation of the NFL's
personal conduct policy and may also have violated the substance abuse
policy.

A fourth-round draft choice from Nebraska, the hard-running Buckhalter has
rushed for 428 yards and two touchdowns on 92 carries this year, starting
several games in place of the injured Duce Staley. Although Staley has
returned to the starting lineup, and had his best game of the season last
week, Buckhalter is still a key part of the Eagles offense.


[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [  OUR VIEW  ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]


Shaking the head here.   Bottom line is this has a positive effect on
Staley.

Thanks to Footballguy Mike Green for pointing me to this one.

Joe

look like he will play.  Stacey Mack will start again for the Jaguars.

likely to split time time with starter Doug Chapman.

needed.  He appears on the injury report as probable with a sore 
ankle.  LaDainian Tomlinson will start again this week.

continues to play great in his absence.    

Kevan Barlow (SF) was able to practice Thursday, but then had to have 
his knee drained afterwords.  He expects to play this weekend and is 
listed as probable with a sore quadricep.

remain the starters.

Rod Smith (Den) did not practice on Thursday.  The team is being very 
quiet whether he will play or not.  He appears on the injury report

and is expected to start.

Kevin Kasper (Den) was able to practice on Thursday.  He appears on 
the injury report as questionable with a sore ankle.

after he told the coach before last week's game that he no longer
had the desire to play.  He later changed his mind about playing, but 
the team booted him off in a team meeting.  

Keith Poole (Den) has lined up as the #2 receiver in practice this 
week.  He is battling Kevin Kasper to replace Eddie Kennison in the 
lineup.

He was back on the practice field Thursday and expects to start.  

Donald Driver (GB) missed both Wednesday and Thursday practices.  He
