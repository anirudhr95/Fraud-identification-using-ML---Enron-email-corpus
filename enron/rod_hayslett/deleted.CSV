"Daily Summary of Risk Data","Summary Risk Data as of 11/20/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	      83	
Active Physical Positions	      38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	   (146.1)	
VaR ($thousands)	    166.5 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	       0	
		



Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

"ETS Year-end Performance Evaluation Process","
The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.  Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.  This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.

(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)

Feedback and Evaluation
Employees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.

?	PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7
?	Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14
?	Written evaluations due to HR			January 15

Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.

Compensation
Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.  Division Head approval is required.

As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.

Relative Talent Reviews
Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.  The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.  Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.  Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.  Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.  EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.  Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.

If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative.

Gary

Subject: UE 115 reconsideration denied - rate mitigation proposalpending


Two pieces of info here.
 
1.  The Commission denied the request of CUB, ICNU, and AOI to reconsider the UE 115 rates and reduce them to avoid rate shock.  I have just read the Order and probably could not have written it better.  The Commission left us in a better place as far as a possible appeal, if that was possible.  
 
2.  OPUC Staff has requested, however, that we file a rate mitigation proposal outside of the UE 115 docket.  We explored several alternatives with parties in early November.  We would like to be responsive, if for no other reason than to build some goodwill back with these groups as we head in to the transaction process.  Here is what we would like to propose:
 
a.  For all customers 30 kW and above, we would spread our 2002 short-term purchases over two years, delivering a credit in 2002 and switching to a collection in 2003.  This would result in a balance to collect as of 12/02 of about $70 million.  This would be collected on a dollar-for-dollar basis in 2003, with no risk to us for load variations.
 
b.  For all customers, we would manage 2002 rate changes to maintain current levels except for
 
    -  the 3% public purpose charge, which would occur 3/1 as scheduled
    -  a possible increase for the 2002 PCA if extreme adverse conditions (hydro primarily) indicate that we will otherwise end the year with a very large balance.
 
We can accomplish this through some creative use of $$ we are holding to return to customers and temporary delays in some minor rate changes scheduled for the fall of 2002.
 
While we will file this, I do not know if the Commission will accept it or whether various interests will intervene in opposition.  Any changes to this would probably only decrease the amount we are financing, not increase it.  The plan would have an effective date of 1/1/02 if accepted.  
 
Jim Piro is reviewing this and we would need some action by either the Commission or NNG to be able to do it, because of our current cash and short-term debt situation.  Solutions exist.  Please let me know if we can proceed.  I do think this is important for the success of our transaction filing, even if it ultimately does not occur.  That we made an effort will be remembered.

Credit Data
I believe the write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Paul on this memo to confirm.

Financial Trading Risk Data
We provide aggregate position data for ETS not aggregate VAR, e.g.  ETS is long 10 MMCFD natural gas at Ventura for January 2002, etc. vs. ETS has $1.5 million total VAR.  This is necessary for two reasons: 1.) Enron's VAR does not necessarily equal the sum of its subsidiaries VAR since there may be offsetting positions  throughout the business units.  2.)  Our trading books software (Caminus) does not have the capability to compute VAR in accordance with the specific methodology required (Monte Carlo simulation) in the Enron policy.

Project Analysis Data
I think this write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Lisa and Cheryl to confirm.

Pam,
As you know, we negotiated a deal for EOGR to take over our recently vacated space at 3AC 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21. We also negotiated a deal for them to purchase only the Teknion workstations which were already in the spaces on Levels 17-20 (not 21 furniture). The total purchase price is $205,000. plus all taxes.

I've been informed that the former EI groups report up to ETS. Therefore, the Bill of Sale shall be signed by an officer in ETS (Rod Hayslett), not EPSC. The Bill of Sale has been prepared by our legal team and is ready for Rod Hayslett to sign. I would like to get the document to you for signature and over to EOGR for signature by Friday, 11/9/01.

Let me know if you need anything further.

Thanks,
Reggie

Subject:	Current Vacancy-Partnership Accounting Services
Importance:	High

I received a voicemail from Miranda while I was out of the office last week indicating that all vacancies require re-justification/authorization.

I had been interviewing for the open accountant position prior to leaving for vacation.  I have interviewed one internal and two external candidates.  I had indicated I would be notifying them this week of my hiring decision. The position needs to be filled for the following reasons:

Northern Border Partners has completed 3 major acquisitions this year and one at the end of third quarter last year.
We have been transitioning these companies to SAP this year resulting in significantly higher maintenance time for additional companies, all internal coding (Cost centers/FARorders), intercompany reconcilliations, account reconcilliations.
All companies are consolidated with Northern Border Partners requiring financial statement preparation
We will be bringing on Midwestern Gas Transmission Company effective January 1.  Their accounting in currently being done by El Paso through the end of the year.
We continue to be behind on certain routine activities, bank reconcilliations being the primary one.  With the additional companies, this has increased the level of activity in this area.
IPayit has created additional manual accounts payable processing due to issues with payment processing through the system.
All of the additional companies has resulted in additional wire transfer activity which is all entered manually in our department.
The acquisition of a Canadian operation has resulted in significant time required in working with the 3rd party that  is operating this facility as well as now requiring foreign currency translation.
New accounting requirements are requiring additional analysis and reporting requirements.

I am available to discuss any of the above issues at your convenience.

Subject:	Third Quarter Review of Northern and Transwestern

	
FYI, 

Andersen has agreed that they will be able to issue review reports on the pipelines based on the following terms:

1.  The review opinions must be restricted to the lenders only.
2.  There must be a substantial footnote on the ""overhang"" issues (i.e., SEC investigation, potential bankruptcy, asset carryvalues in certain situations, etc.)
3.  The review opinion will contain an emphasis of matter paragraph related to the above footnote.
4.  ENE management rep and O/S legal must rep that nothing they are working on (related to investigation) affects the pipelines or its management.
5.  Pipelines must represent that it is not involved in any of the matters under investigation.

In addition to the above, AA  believes that they must expand their review work in order to satisfy themselves related to the issues and reps required above.

In connection with all of this, the banks need these reviews completed by the closing date which is currently expected to be November 9.



I believe that the following are our immediate to do's in order to get Andersen started:

1.  Ene to provide full quarterly statements of Northern and Transwestern to Andersen ASAP.
2.  Discuss w/ Willard/Duncan the level of detail/analysis that they will need to perform review.
3.  Provide necessary PBC schedules, etc.
4.  Draft the footnote discussed in 2. above and get approved by Rick and Legal
5.  Get Andersen to draft the language they would like to see in rep letters.  Get approved by Rick/ Legal.



As to each of the above to do's, 

Gary  - can you contact the pipeline group as soon as you get in this morning and see if the financial statements for the 3Q have already been put together.  If they have not, we need to get them produced ASAP.  They have already been put on notice that these statements will be a priority.  Also, lets see what type of support they typically provide to AA for their quarterly financial reveiws.   I assume the scopes will now be much lower since the reviews are on stand alone pipes instead of ENE Consol.

Bob - can you call Saunders and fill him in?  Once I get in I want to talk to Duncan and Willard about #2, #4 and #5 above. You are welcome to be a part of those discussions.  Also we should discuss what we believe the appropriate scopes to be.

Rick - Any thoughts on the above Andersen requirements?  Other thoughts?

If I have missed any critical steps that you can think of, please let me know.

It is now 4:00 a.m.  I plan to be in by around 10:00 a.m.  If you need me for any reason call me at home (832-593-8065).  Thanks.

I am assuming that on page three of the 2001-2003 projections that really captures 2002-2004 the operations numbers are in 000s not millions as noted above.

 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to ""sponsor"" every child in that school.  What we mean by ""sponsor"" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to ""sponsor"" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!

"TW Forecast","
I had a meeting with Dan Pribble and Barney Brasher this morning reviewing the current status of the TW Operation forecast.  It appears, at this point in time, that we have been able to clear up and cover all the unplanned expenditures, except for a remaining stretch of approximately $1,000,000.   We are working with all entities within ETS Operations on NNG and TW to find ways and means to cover this remaining stretch between the two companies (TW) and (NNG) during the month of December.

Since late October, Barney and his team have uncovered expenses on TW in the amount of approximately $3 million that was not covered in the Fourth Quarter forecast.   We have cleaned up all but the remaining $1 million.

Dan and Barney have both held meetings face to face with the parties involved in forecasting, or lack of it, and are implementing corrective actions.

We really appreciate the massive effort all personnel are taking to help alleviate this situation and we within OSS have implemented tighter controls and reviews on all the Business Units.   We will initiate weekly flash reviews and monitor closely the processing of all expense invoices during the month of December.  If you have any futher insights of means to relieve this situation, please advise.

Subject: Consultant's view on gas transmission into California
Importance: High


Rod:

As we discussed here are the bulletts that summarize what we heard from our consultants.

Overall demand picture

Believe it will be 2006 before the California market will get back to 2000/2001 demand levels

          2002            demand down approximately 900 mmcf/d
          2003            demand will be flat
          2004            growth in demand will begin
          2005-2006   return to 2001 demand levels

Reasoning:
   2001 was a dry year - the lack of hydro generation created an additional 600 mmcf/d demand for gas in California
   Anticipated generation capacity overbuild in California - new more efficient power plants with better heat rates will displace older gas fired generation, reducing the amount of gas              required to generate a MW of electricity on the margin
   California electricity rate increases have curtailed demand for power and subsequently, gas

Gas transmission capacity into the state

Over the next two to three years there will be an additional 2.0 Bcf/d of transmission capacity into California
   800 mmcf/d in 2002
   900 mmcf/d in 2003 (Kern River expansion)
   300 mmcf/d               (El Paso conversion of All American oil line and power up)

San Juan basin gas

San Juan basin production is declining

   first half of 2001 vs. first half of 2000 production off by approximately 200 mmcf/d
   Rockies gas will not replace declining production in the San Juan San Juan gas will move closer to Permian pricing


The consultants believe that the combination of these factors will put decontracting pressure on existing transmission into the state of California, and especially the El Paso and Transwestern lines.

However, the ""wild card"" in their view is unforeseen California power demand growth.

As we discussed, JPMorgan would like to hear your views on the above issues.

Please give me a call when you have had sufficient time to digest and we can set up a conference call to make the most efficient use of your time.

Thanks Rod

Brent

Also, when you have had a chance to look at sales gas volume growth please
e-mail the volume numbers to me...thanks

"RE: Producers requesting L/Cs","I am not very comfortable with that at all.  I think with the filing of the proxy that we would have a disclosure issue..  It could also call into question whether or not Enron plans to perform under the MTBE deal. I do not think we need a letter though.  A letter agreement already exists between the two companies.  Another alternative would be for EOTT to go get there own LC,s and have Enron pick-up the cost.  That would keep EOTT's unitholders indifferent.

I have told Lawrence that if it is necessary we can get a letter affirming the deal.    However, how comfortable might you be in telling them to do business differently to avoid calling on the LC's.     Not suggesting we should just thinking we should probably be prepared if asked.

Based upon our conversation, I agree that we s/not need to have any immediate disclosure over Enron's ability to perform - OK, Main Issue Done! 

However, I do feel that we should address/consider, before issuing the 10-Q, whether we need a written confirmation from Enron of their intention to meet EOTT's LC needs estimated to be in a range of $200-$400mm.

Do you think we need for Enron to acknowledge, in writing, their ability and/or intention to perform under our facility?

Looks like there may have been a little confusion here, but it appears that the deal is still working as before.

Rod, I am very concerned about the statement that Enron cannot get any added LCs' issued.  This may be a disclosue event for us.  I think we need this retracted and for Enron to affirm there ability to perform under our facility.  Your thoughts?

We have the following new requests for L/Cs to cover our lease purchases.  They are requesting L/Cs because of the Enron situation.  I've spoken with some of them and they just won't budge.  

1.  Newfield Exploration		$3MM   	to cover Oct & Nov
2.  J. Cleo Thompson		$1.8MM to cover Oct & Nov 
3.  Apache Corp.		$700K     to cover Nov
4.  W. C. Miller			$175K     to cover Nov 

I've already spoken to Jesse Mata at Enron and she is telling me she cannot get any L/Cs issued - their banks are not allowing it.   I've got a call into Jack Insigna at Standard Chartered to see if they would be willing to EOTT's L/Cs.  He's checking.  

We could prepay Apache - they are obviously not a credit risk.  the others i'm not sure about - we're checking their credit.  

let me know about how much you're willing to with Enron.  thanks.  jc

> 
> November 20, 2001
> 
> FERC OFFERS FURTHER GUIDANCE ON RTOs
> 
> Earlier this month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC"" or
> ""Commission"") issued an Order Providing Guidance on Continued Processing
> of RTO Filings (""RTO Guidance Order"").  This order was issued by the FERC
> in response to the RTO development efforts in the United States and
> comments received by the Commission at the public conferences held at the
> FERC from October 15 through 19, 2001, the open Commission meeting on
> October 24, 2001, and the Western Regional Infrastructure Workshop in
> Seattle, Washington on November 1-2, 2001.
> 
> Elements of RTO Development
> 
> 	The RTO Guidance Order states that further development and eventual
> completion of the RTO process will occur along two parallel tracks before
> the Commission.  One track will address scope and governance issues
> through the pending RTO dockets following consultation with state
> commissioners.  The other track will address business and process issues
> through the transmission tariff and market design rulemaking in Docket No.
> RM01-12-000.  The RTO Guidance Order also provided important details
> concerning key elements of the RTO development process.  
> 
> Specifically, the Commission will:
> 
> 	* issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""NOPR"") on terms and
> conditions of interconnection services during January 2002 and a separate
> NOPR on interconnection pricing issues by April 2002.
> 
> 	* use the pending RTO dockets to address current and future
> proposals for fulfilling the eight Order No. 2000 RTO Functions, including
> the numerous business models proposed for the administration of critical
> wholesale market operations;
> 	 	
> 	* create state-federal RTO panels to promote dialogue on RTO
> development between the Commission and state commissions;
> 
> 	* actively seek advice from state commissioners concerning the
> composition of regional markets;
> 
> 	* meet with investor representatives to better understand the
> financing of independent transmission companies and transmission
> construction;
> 
> 	* perform addition cost-benefit analyses on RTOs to guide its
> efforts and to provide a quantitative basis for the appropriate number of
> RTOs.
> 
> New Policy Shift
> 
> The Commission has officially abandoned its December 15, 2001 deadline for
> RTO operation and will instead issue orders addressing pending RTO filings
> only after receiving comments from the appropriate state regional panels.
> Future RTO progress in each region will be governed by timelines to be
> established in future Commission orders.  RTOs will be based on a sound
> business plan with substantive buy-in from a cross-section of market
> participants. With respect to the West, the RTO Guidance Order commented
> favorably upon the development of three Western sub-regional organizations
> bound by a workable seams agreement and operating under a larger umbrella
> organization.
> 
> The terms of the RTO Guidance Order reflect the Commission's reaction to
> the drastic changes occurring in the electric power industry since the
> issuance of Order No. 2000 in December 1999.  The cumulative and ongoing
> effects of the California crisis (including PG&E's bankruptcy and the
> bitter El Paso Natural Gas Company litigation), uncertainties in gas and
> power trading markets, and the business and regulatory factors underlying
> the tremendous disparity in levels of RTO development have influenced (and
> will continue to influence) Commission activity in this area.  In stark
> opposition to the mandates of the past summer, the RTO Guidance Order
> depicts a Commission committed to pragmatic, cautious implementation of
> strategy devised through cooperation and collaboration with the states and
> industry.  
> 
> Future Commission action in RTO development will likely:  (1) reflect
> conclusions reached through consensus and development that will increase
> the likelihood of substantive success and, importantly, more broadly
> disperse the political risk; and (2) emphasize increased market
> transparency to mitigate the volatility that has drastically shortened the
> time window for business failure in the electric power industry from a
> matter of years to a matter of weeks.  The Commission will likely continue
> to investigate and respond to market activity and trends during future RTO
> development. 
> 
> This FERC order comes at a unique and pivotal moment in RTO development
> and will have an immediate and direct commercial impact upon business
> activities in the electric power industry.  The Commission's next phases
> of RTO development will dictate business strategy for much of the
> foreseeable future and will have substantial and unprecedented impact upon
> the development of electric power markets and businesses operating in

Just in case we miss one another this afternoon (I will be leaving for B&P's
office at 2:30), just a few comments -

ENE:
Second line, ""particular"" misspelled
Need period at end of first paragraph
Liquidity section - since we are closing today and funding tomorrow, we should
say, ""has executed"" (your call)

NNG:
4th paragraph - ""increase peak day deliverability for transportation services""

TW:
2nd paragraph - We paid off the $16 million last week as part of our $550
million credit facility.
3rd paragraph - this actually sounds worse than what it is - 70% of capacity is
subscribed for until 10/31/05, but sentence implies a lot of turnback risk
during next couple of years.  Big SoCal gas contract comes due in 10/31/05 which
represents about 30% of total capacity.
Liquidity section - ""no"" versus minimal.
Key credit strengths, second bullet - ""regional"" misspelled.

Do you include any financial info?

FYI- Note Sen. Lee's comments re: merchant plants. Only merchant plant players are suggesting the issue will be discussed by the legislature in 2002. Incumbents will probably enjoy the status quo for a couple more years.

Panel okays energy plan



The governor's panel on energy endorses opening the state's power market to competition, but few expect it to be tackled next year. 


By STEVE HUETTEL
? St. Petersburg Times,
published November 16, 2001 
  _____  


TALLAHASSEE -- The governor's energy study commission Thursday endorsed a plan backed by the state's big utilities to open Florida's wholesale electricity market to competition. 

The 113-page report will frame the debate on deregulating the state's power business. But commission members acknowledged it's unlikely legislators will tackle the complex plan next year when they are struggling with a budget shortfall and redrawing their electoral districts. 

Some members of the panel wanted to recommend that the Legislature act first on the part of deregulation that the entrenched state utilities have long fought: giving their out-of-state competitors free rein to build power plants in the Florida. 

""This (plan) was designed to be so weighty . . . it will never get anywhere in the Legislature,"" said state Sen. Tom Lee, R-Brandon. ""If that happens, the status quo wins."" 

Lee's proposal to let in the outsiders first was narrowly defeated. Opponents argued it wasn't fair to permit such ""merchant plants"" unless Florida utilities also were allowed to sell their existing plants to unregulated affiliates. 

Commission chairman Walter Revell defended the report's complexity and said no one expects legislators to turn it into law quickly. 

""Energy is big, technical, complex, controversial and capital-intensive,"" said Revell, who oversaw the panel's 14 months of work. ""There are no short, simple solutions for a strategic plan for energy for Florida."" 

Gov. Jeb Bush appointed the Florida Energy 2020 Study Commission after out-of-state companies were blocked from building merchant power plants by the Legislature and the state Supreme Court. Florida is the only state that bans merchants from building the most efficient natural gas-fired plants. 

Bush argued that the state needed to attract more power plants to meet Florida's growing appetite for electricity and avoid California-style power shortages. 

The panel sent legislators a plan earlier this year that would have let merchants in and allowed state utilities to sell their plants to unregulated affiliates at depreciated values. 

Critics charged the proposal would let utilities spin off the plants -- paid for by their Florida customers -- at bargain-basement prices. That initial plan died in the Legislature. 

Commission members tried to fix the problem in the new deregulation plan. 

Ratepayers should get half of any profits utilities reaped from selling their plants, the report recommends, while company shareholders should eat any loss from a sale. 

But Department of Environmental Protection secretary David Struhs said the provision wouldn't benefit ratepayers because there won't be any profits to share when utilities sell their plants at the depreciated value. 

The energy commission had originally proposed taking away the authority of the state Public Service Commission, the governor and Cabinet to reject unpopular power plant projects. But environmentalists strongly opposed the plan. The final report proposed eliminating the PSC's review of new plants but left it up the Legislature to decide the role of the governor and Cabinet. 

Wednesday, most panel members insisted the report was full of intertwined compromises that wouldn't work on their own. 

""It would be a tragic mistake to unsettle the balance by taking segments out,"" said Stephen Mitchell, a Tampa attorney. 

But Lee suggested state utilities helped make the plan overly complicated by design. If it failed, he said, established players such as Florida Power and Tampa Electric would get to keep their monopoly over the electricity business. 

A top Florida Power executive said afterward that the way it turned out was ""a win-win."" 

""The current system functions well,"" said Vincent Dolan, vice president for regulatory and public affairs. ""Now, we've got a report that could make the system better.""

As per our phone conversation, the list of information we would like to
have follows:

1.  FERC Form 2s for the last three years
2.  Revenue breakdown:
   Assumptions made for the contracted period, as well as the time period
   beyond current contracts - firm/interruptible mix and volumes, tariffs
   for each type of transportation contract
   A build up from contracts to the revenues in the model would be ideal
3.  As before, compressor gas volumes and assumed sales prices for the
projected years
4.  As before, the story as it relates to CERA's view of the world
5.  Explicit calculation of rate base going forward
6.  Employee benefit plan information - funding status, return rates,
future liabilities

Thanks Rod.

Credit Data
I believe the write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Paul on this memo to confirm.

Financial Trading Risk Data
We provide aggregate position data for ETS not aggregate VAR, e.g.  ETS is long 10 MMCFD natural gas at Ventura for January 2002, etc. vs. ETS has $1.5 million total VAR.  This is necessary for two reasons: 1.) Enron's VAR does not necessarily equal the sum of its subsidiaries VAR since there may be offsetting positions  throughout the business units.  2.)  Our trading books software (Caminus) does not have the capability to compute VAR in accordance with the specific methodology required (Monte Carlo simulation) in the Enron policy.

Project Analysis Data
I think this write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Lisa and Cheryl to confirm.

"RE: Floor space billing corrections 0366/111692","I think for December we should leave it as is while we see what the fallout is going to be. But, if we do not have plans to build by year-end, it probably should go to Corp vacant.  ROD, do you agree?

And by the way...do we want to keep it that way for EB 41 or do we want to switch to another category (Corp vacant) since you guys are not using that floor?  What do you think, Pam?

Ruthann,

In October and November,  the billing for the entire 41st floor was taken to 0366/111718 per management's direction while under reconstruction.

To my knowledge, that is still the case.

Please contact, Deborah Bubenko regarding construction completion.

Thank you.

The October EPSC invoice showed the following floor space being billed incorrectly to 0366/111692:

Room #		Should be billed to		Sq. ft	
ECN 4106		0366/112476		547

ECN 4751		0366/112476		314

Also on their October invoice, there is an entry for rent correction for 1154 sq.ft. The ticket number is EBR10019310085, dated 10/17/01. I looked at all my rent corrections submitted, and it isn't one of mine. Could you please advise what rooms this correction covers?

Thanks for your help.

Subject: Weekly Report


Stan/Jim,
 
Following is a list of last week's most salient events.
 
Central America/DR:
 
Guatemala:  MARAD will reply this week as to their position vis-a-vis the reduction of Enron's contingent support from $28 to $10 million.  It is possible they will ask for additional information.  
 
Nicaragua:  Current credit ratings required the funding of approximately $6.3 million into a debt service reserve account (project was allowed to sweep the funds against a corporate guarantee by Enron, which was backstopped by the partners pro-rata to their ownership in the project).  Partners to reimburse Enron their pro-rata share, such that Enron's ultimate outflow will be approximately $2.2 million.  Team tried to get MARAD to agree to alternative solutions but MARAD simply refused citing bad past experience and political implications.
 
Panama:  Team in Houston last week to review the upcoming PPA bids by Elektra (one of the two distribution companies in Panama).  Three issues are worth noting: (i) requirement to post bid bonds (approximately $10 million) will likely need some sort of Enron support (BLM can't get bid bonds on its own although local management continues attempting to do so); (ii) BLM's marginal costs are among highest in Panama.  A preliminary strategy has been mapped out; and (iii) PPA terms are a bit ""one-sided"" in favor of the distributor.  BLM and other market participants have tried repeatedly to get the distco to change terms without success.  
 
Dominican Republic:  El Paso confirmed it can't work with us.  Operationally, the plant is working well.  As noted on an earlier e-mail, EFI's fuel supplier for SECLP, Vitol, asked for a letter of credit or pre-payment terms.  Enron rejected the request.  SECLP bought cargo directly from Vitol.  We are working closely with Tom Moran of ENE credit on these issues.
 
Ecoelectrica:
This week was a very productive week.  Update as follows:  Lender Process:  Based on several conversations this week, lenders have stated they understand that Mirant's insurance package is the result of market conditions.  Lenders are prepared to pursue credit committee approval with the $300 million coverage.  Mirant offered a 6-month only waiver on the deductibles.  Lenders appear content with that option.  ENE insurance has approximately 75% of the underwriters on board with our back-up plan to provide the additional $200 million tranche.  Backup will be used only if credit committee(s) kick back existing coverage.  Mirant to issue a certification of compliance with QF (by Eco) and a legal opinion asap.  Based on the progress this week and the remaining commitment on deliverables, it is expected that the lender's agent can put together the entire lender package and submit it to the lender group by Tuesday of next week.  Finally, Mirant also committed to providing comments (if any) to the Lender Consent Agreement.  ENE and EME have reviewed and provided comments already.  GE Consent:  Mirant committed to sending their ""versions"" of the key documents on the GE buy-out on Friday nite (late).  I have not seen the document but they have repeatedly stated that the documents are ""conforming"".  Union Carbide Guarantee:  Plan to finalize language early next week.  Schedule:  Mirant has committed to fulfilling CP's as early as possible (and is acting on that statement) as long as we can allow them to fund on 12/19.  They state they are confident they can close CP's by earlier than 12/14 and can fund on 12/19.  CSFB has not shed light on the apparent funding (timing) limitation but has offered to investigate further.  
 
APACHI  
 
Philippines: The team did an excellent job of advancing discussions and negotiations with NPC but was unable to move the slow government machinery fast enough to make it to a signing by last Thursday's New York event.  Nevertheless, momentum is high and team continues to work toward a 12/15 agreement date; funding wouldn't occur until early next year. 
 
Guam:  Continue discussions with Mirant and AES with a focus on getting them over the hump on the issue of Enron's contingent obligation to cover the potential shortfall under a GPA buy-out event.  Work continues.  Meetings have been set with Dr. Boyce to discuss his interest in the Guam project.  
 
China:  Unit 2 still scheduled to come back on line on 11/23.  Two likely causes still under investigation (poor vaccum or material design flaw).  Work on capital reduction for Chengdu on hold until discussions are held with Houston to ensure consensus.  In the mean time, several parties have approached us with interest in Chengdu.  On Hainan, team is paying several visits to the new SAFE representatives, first to work on the mid November repayment ($10 million).   Next step would be liquidation.  
 
Europe  
 
Gaza:  Waiting to hear from CCC (partner) on conceptual proposal: ENE to provide limited technical support and financial services support to help put in place cost over-run facility and to help with remaining construction activities and CCC to take our equity (at no cost) and any remaining obligations.  Aim is to eliminate the potential exposure on ENE's $9 million of guarantees.  
 
Trakya:  During meetings in London, OPIC informed us that they had had good meetings with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy.  Government stated they would ""clean up"" arrears but could not do so before January 2002 (presumably there are no budget funds left).  Government committed to work with OPIC on resolving the forex dispute issue but acknowledged that the legal opinion they had sought and received didn't address the issue properly and thus needed additional work to provide the Government with the backing it needed to give the issue resolution.  OPIC agreed to send the Government ""terms of reference"" on their conceptual agreements.  On our question of change in frequency in the distribution of dividends OPIC stated they would expeditiously move to review our proposal, indicating no pre-disposed position against it.  
 
Sarlux:  team continues to prepare to submit response to EPC contractor's claim, as well as our own counter-claim, all scheduled to be submitted on November 30th.   Team continues to work on sorting out technical issues at the plant, including meetings with senior Texaco officials.  
 
ENS:  local team and Adam Overfield worked to resolve remaining issue over final completion certificate.  Issue was related to CO2 emmissions on GT12 vs the EPC contract parameters.  Team has convinced the lender's engineer that issue is of no relevance.  Team is now moving to secure lender approval.  This releases $1.95 million of contingent support by ENE.  
 
Europe Sales Prospects:  IPower submitted preliminary proposals for ENS and Trakya, both well below expectations.
 
Other:  Team is working closely with RAC to come up with updated fair market valuations, cashflow projections by month for the quarter ended Dec. 31, and revised/updated transfer restriction information.
 
Thanks, Mariella
 
Isabel: please distribute to team as customary.

Subject:	Agenda items for Nov. 7th FERC Meeting

The agenda is attached as a word document at the end of this message; the link to the current agenda is not yet functional, but should be tomorrow at http://www.ferc.fed.us/public/isd/sunshine.htm
____________________________________________________________

On the agenda for next week's FERC Sunshine meeting are the following:

Administrative Items:

A-1: Agency Administrative Matters, Docket AD02-1
A-2: Legislative Matters, Docket AD02-2


Gas Items:

G-13: Northern Border Pipeline, RP01-267-001.  Rate T1-B firm backhaul service; this service was accepted and suspended by the FERC on March 30, 2001.  There has been no subsequent action by FERC on the tariff filing.

G-15:  Midwestern Gas Transmission, MG01-30-000.  Midwestern's revised standards of conduct under Order 637. 

C-3:  Northern Natural Gas, CP01-403-000:  Northern's application to construct and modify facilities at the Bellville Compressor Station in Green County, Wisconsin.  The facilities are necessary to meet current Northern customer obligations in light of increased pressure that will result from the addition of Guardian Pipeline. 

G-3:  Kern River Gas Transmission System, RP00-157-005.  Kern River's Firm Customer Group has protested a negotiated rate that allows the use of unlimited transportation at receipt and delivery points other than those listed for the backhaul services, at negotiated rates, including an index spread rate adjustment for apparent forward haul transportation.  The Firm Customers are concerned that this model will allow for additional forward haul firm capacity to be sold at already ""constrained and oversold California delivery points, such as Wheeler Ridge,"" resulting in (1) degraded service for preexisting firm shippers [who are already experiencing reliability problems], and (2) increased delivery rates to California, ""similar to those that occurred on Transwestern Pipeline Company?.""

 C-1: Cross Bay Pipeline and Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line, CP00-412-000:  This may be a certificate for Transco's Cross Bay Pipeline, a new 614,628 Dth/d interstate pipeline system that would extend from Middlesex County, NJ, across the lower New York Bay, all the way to Nassau County, NY.  Transco will lease approx. two-thirds of that capacity from Cross Bay.

Electric Items:

E-1:  FERC/State Partnerships, EX02-6.  This should be the Staff report to the Commissioners on a suggested formal structure for ongoing communications between FERC and state commissions and representatives (as discussed at the Oct. 24th Sunshine meeting).

E-2:  Electricity Market Design and Structure, RM01-12-000.  FERC issued summaries of the RTO Week discussions and has asked for comments.

Let's suspend these discussions for the time being.

Rod,
Attached are three cases for Project Armstrong.  I know you're out of the office until Wednesday but I thought if you could respond by Blackberry or phone as to which case we should send to TCPL, I would get that to them before the holiday so they could work on it Thursday and Friday.

*	Case 1 is an 8% distribution growth case (starting with the plan and increasing acquisition activity to deliver 8% growth).  To achieve that our total capex for NBP goes up to an average of just over $400 million per year.
*	Case 2 tracks with our budget case and involves about $200 million in capex per year and results in 2 years of 8% growth and then a flat distribution level for the remaining 3 years.
*	Case 3 utilizes the budget case but eliminates all acquisitions (capex is about $30 - $40 million average per year for maintenance and asset development) and assumes NBPL recontracting occurs at 85% of max rates.  The result is distributions increase to $3.30 in 2002 and stay at that level throughout the 5 year period.

Obviously Case 1 is the most aggressive in terms of valuation among the three.  Please let me know if that is ok to send or do you have something else in mind.  Also I could fax hard copies if you would like...

"Weekly iPayit Update Report","Rick/George,

Below is this weeks iPayit update report 

Overall, the Accounts Payable process continues to improve and appears to be heading toward a steady state. Though on a daily basis we continue to take calls regarding errors which have occurred and/or confusion as to why things happen like they do in this new process, overall these calls and issues are occurring at a much reduced  pace. We are continuing to see improvements in the overall aging of invoices sitting in in the various stages of the accounts payable process including document handling, transaction processing, support group and employee iPayit inboxes. Additionally, the call center is consistently answering calls well within the established service level agreements.  

Primary areas of focus:
1) Monitor and manage the various stages of the process and ensure that invoices are flowing through each stage within an acceptable time frame.
2) Continue to network and assist the business units in addressing questions/issues/problems 
3) Assess effectiveness of non-routine AP transaction processing tasks which SourceNet is attempting to perform and make necessary mid-course changes (i.e. P-Card expense allocation journal entries, etc.
4) Complete system integration audit verifying proper transfer of information from the various components of the iPayit platform (FileNet, SAP and iPayit).
5) Implement processes and procedures for all return check/void check/refunds handling. Assign roles and responsibilities for GSS/Accounting/Treasury/SourceNet
6) Improvements in the turn-around time with call center ticket which are escalated
7) Evaluate the benefits of migrating the AP pricing model to transaction based verses the current cost/plus model

Attached for your information is the ""Drain the Swamp"" scorecard for the period ending October 23rd.

Please advise if you have any questions or if you need any additional information.

Thank You
John

As per our phone conversation, the list of information we would like to
have follows:

1.  FERC Form 2s for the last three years
2.  Revenue breakdown:
   Assumptions made for the contracted period, as well as the time period
   beyond current contracts - firm/interruptible mix and volumes, tariffs
   for each type of transportation contract
   A build up from contracts to the revenues in the model would be ideal
3.  As before, compressor gas volumes and assumed sales prices for the
projected years
4.  As before, the story as it relates to CERA's view of the world
5.  Explicit calculation of rate base going forward
6.  Employee benefit plan information - funding status, return rates,
future liabilities

Thanks Rod.

How's this?

Recently we've had a couple of mix ups regarding vacant office space and phone moves. In light of this, we'd like to help by coordinating the moves in 3AC like we've been doing in the Enron Building. We know you are all very busy, and we'll be happy to submit move requests for you, including telephone moves and reassignments.

This will also enable us to keep current on floor space billing and make sure it gets corrected when an employee moves.

Please contact Ruthann (x66538) for assistance with any moves in 3AC, and Pam (x36135) for assistance with any moves in the Enron Building. Of course, if one of us is unavailable, feel free to call the other. If an office or cubicle is vacant and you would like to move someone into it, please contact us, so we can help coordinate it and hopefully avoid confusion.

Thanks for your help.

Pam Daily and Ruthann Frausto

Maybe overkill, I would rather send them an email talking about the problems, and they have to let you 2 know when they going to use a space, and how they can coordinate stuff with you 2 instead of dictating.   I am little touchy right now about how to approach people, so we need to be careful.   I am open to more discussion on this, just would like to soften the tone a litlle.

That sounds good. We might also want to include any other request that would potentially use a ""space"" such as tables for data rooms, contractors, etc. If they think it only applies if they are actually moving a person or phone, the spaces we think we have available may be used without churns. For instance, sometimes I think spaces are available for use, only to find boxes and/or equipment has been set up. Just a thought. What do you think -- overkill?

What do you think of this to send out to the admins in 3AC?

In an effort to better control our space planning needs, effective immediately all ETS moves will be coordinated by Pam Daily and Ruthann Frausto. This pertains to all moves, including telephone only moves.

Please contact Pam (X36135)  regarding any moves in the Enron Building, and contact Ruthann (x66538) regarding any moves in the 3AC building. Of course, if one of us is unavailable, feel free to contact the other.

Thank you for your cooperation.

"Wessex Insurances","Dear Jim,

Following Rod's note on 15 October outlining the process for Wessex to
obtain quotes for a standalone insurance programme I enclose the following
documents:

Summary detail of required coverage's;
Profile of Kingsbridge Risk Solutions Ltd (Wessex' existing and proposed
broker).

Unless we hear to the contrary this week we are proposing to instruct
Kingsbridge, assisted where necessary by JLT, to start marketing next week.
We will get back to Enron by the end of November with the definitive quotes
obtained so that you can compare them to any alternatives you are arranging.
I trust this is OK.

One last point is that Kingsbridge/JLT will be covering the vast majority of
the UK market.  I assume they will have a 'clear market' in which to operate
for the sake of efficiency and that you will not be employing another UK
broker to obtain prices and terms for Wessex.

Regards.

Mark

Summary Risk Data as of 10/29/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	       52	
Active Physical Deals	       35	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	     389.3	
VaR ($thousands)	     495.5	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	        0	
		

Physical deals modelled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged phsycal positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance metholodogy, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


NOTE: We are reviewing the modelling of one of the financial deals which may have a significant impact on the numbers reported above.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

If this is true and Enron has conveyed these assets to a structured vehicle, then we have breached transfer obligations on almost every deal, our debt may be in default and we need to understand the consequences asap as Subic and Batangas are the subject of current negotiations.

Jim, 

Because of the nature of what they asked, I just wanted to keep you informed on this.  

Global Finance has requested models, historicals, timings for disposal on the Rawhide assets.  These assets include Subic, Batangas, Guam, Gaspart, Centragas, PQPC, and TGS.  I was going to get them the info on the models and ask for Carol Howes' help on the historicals.  If neccessary, I will also set them up with people over here who can help explain the valuations.

"Daily Summary of Risk Data","Summary Risk Data as of 11/19/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	     83	
Active Physical Positions	     38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	   (61.8)	
VaR ($thousands)	   163.3 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	       0	
		


Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Hopefully, the firewall procedure would be enough for FERC on the trading data we provide.
However, it would be better if we could cut back on providing specific data.

I have the following comments:
Credit Data
I believe the write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Paul on this memo to confirm.

Financial Trading Risk Data
We provide aggregate position data for ETS not aggregate VAR, e.g.  ETS is long 10 MMCFD natural gas at Ventura for January 2002, etc. vs. ETS has $1.5 million total VAR.  This is necessary for two reasons: 1.) Enron's VAR does not necessarily equal the sum of its subsidiaries VAR since there may be offsetting positions  throughout the business units.  2.)  Our trading books software (Caminus) does not have the capability to compute VAR in accordance with the specific methodology required (Monte Carlo simulation) in the Enron policy.

Project Analysis Data
I think this write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Lisa and Cheryl to confirm.

Also, have you had any luck finding the other information we discussed?  Jayshree and I are trying to get a sense of timing.  

I will be in the office for a couple of hours, but I will then be working from home.  I do not have a Blackberry, so would  you please call me if you send additional information?

Rod,

Would you please forward me the CAPEX numbers when Tracy e-mails them to you?  Jayshree indicated that she needs those numbers and it will be easier to send in soft form.

Also, to confirm the numbers in the information you gave me are 30.86 MM for 2001 (this does not include Red Rock) and $68.4 in 2002 (this includes $47 MM for Red Rock).  I am assuming that on page three of the 2001-2003 projections that really captures 2002-2004 the operations numbers are in 000s not millions as noted above.  If this is true you have 15 billion in operations CAPEX - which I don't believe is true.  Let me know.

Thanks
Sarah

Has your group been asked (by your BU or by anyone else) to identify those possible candidates for personnel reductions?  Please let me know.

Wes Colwell has been working on a ""10%"" list per request from his BU, and Rick is going to ask Bob Butts to start working on it tomorrow (after 10Q is filed).

If you have not been asked, you may want to start thinking about it.  Rick said that there may be a request coming to complete the list this week (and to notify people as early as next week), although he has not as yet received that request.

After reviewing the information you sent on Wednesday afternoon I am not certain I can break out the Red Rock revenues.  The RedRockExpansion bids appear to total 113,000 which exceeds the 107,000 capacity you mentioned.  I assume that the 106,700 in the pitchbook is correct.  Please let me know if this is not right.
 
Also, the finalTWrev spreadsheet is the information you included in the pitchbook, correct?  If I sum the four tabs does that constitute all of the exisitng capacity?  Is there any expansion capacity (Red Rock, Gallup) included?  
 
Please let me know if I am not correctly interpreting the data.  Jayshree and I are meeting at 9am tomorrow if you would like to discuss.  We will also be on the call at 10am.

"ETS Finance vacancies","In Stan's staff meeting this morning he asked we let you know of any vacancies that are being filled.  I have two that are currently in process: 
Director, Financial Planning -recruiting internally and externally on a concurrent basis due primarily to Omaha location,  preference given to internal candidates.
Financial Planning Analyst (Ben Humann's vacancy) - recruiting internally only.

For either of these positions I think Enron should be willing to pay relocation if necessary (to avoid severance costs).  From the standpoint of the partnerships I don't think NBP should pay this cost since there are plenty of local candidates from which to choose.

If it would help to have move time to interview and find the right person for the EGS CIO position, I would be willing to run the organization as Steve tries to leave for his new position.  I do not have an interest in the position but know I am capable of handling the job on a temporary basis if it would help.   I do not want us to rush just to fill the position if you and Stan do not have a strong feeling for any of the current candidates.  I think we need a strong person to carry us forward and deal with Networks.   cvb

	Paul,

	The Methanol Plant was shutdown during August of this year due to poor economics.  The following is a list of steps 	taken to prepare the plant for this outage:


	Lines and vessels have been purged and are mostly open to the atmosphere.
	Lubricating oils have been drained from equipment, ""large oil systems"" (e.g. syn gas and recycle compressor lube 	systems) have been soap washed.
	Oily water sewer and separation vessels have been washed with soap.
	Chemical storage vessels have been cleaned out or removed from the plant.
	Cooling tower wooden structures have been demolished and removed from the site.
	Industrial gases (e.g. calibration, welding, etc.) have been removed from the plant.
	Natural gas and oxygen lines to the facility have been blinded at the battery limits.
	All catalyst and resins have been removed from the plant.
	All firefighting equipment (e.g. fire water, monitors, extinguishers, foam, foam truck, etc.) remain in the facility 	and are serviceable.
	LEL monitoring equipment and the Whalen alarm system remain in service and are serviceable.
	Provisions are being made for necessary periodic inspection of fire extinguishers. (Should LEL test, alarm test, 	monitor inspection, be included?)
	Electrical power will remain to all facilities and will be serviceable.
	All current utilities to the Tank Farm/Barge Loading Facilities will remain and will be serviceable.
	The process area will be secured by a six foot high chain link fence with 20' wide gates on each side at drive in 	points.  The gates will be locked.
 	The oxygen compressor located in Sunoco area will be secured by a six foot high chain link fence with one pedestrian 	gate (locked).
	Pipe racks on the north boundary of the plant will be within the security fence, pipe racks on the west boundary will 	be outside the security fence.
	Admin and analyzer buildings will be locked and HVAC systems turned off.
	The warehouse will continue to house a reduced level of inventory with HVAC system in service.
	
	Please let me know if you need any additional information regarding the latest outage of the Methanol plant.

	Thanks,

Paul,

Further to our discussion on 10/03/01, we understand that Tom Meers is
looking at providing additional information regarding the above.
Specifically, he is to provide a report advising Enron's plans for this
facility including the details of the ""shut down"" process, maintenance of
the facility, security at the site, etc. This information will be provided
to Enron Corp Property Package underwriters when received. Our current
understanding is that the facility has not been operating for the past 30
days and is preparing for a longer term shut down phase. We further
understand from our conversation that Enron is clearing the product streams
from the system and that the plant is currently ""hydrocarbon free"" thus
eliminating a substantial portion of the facility fire hazards. Also, we
understand that the tank farm and control building will continue to operate.
Enron is maintaining front gate security and is considering a separate
fencing around the process area.

Paul, we look forward to receiving the report as requested. Please advise
status.

Thanks and regards,

David Huckabay

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Subject: Toll Model Review Meeting Updates



The model review meeting on Thursday went well, and the consensus was that there are many changes to be made to the current Foothills economic model. Many assumptions in the current model were challenged by the participant companies. Foothills agreed to reflect the suggested changes to the model (Andy is supposed to send out a summary of the discussion) and provided an electronic copy of the model for withdrawn partners' review. Withdrawn partners agreed to give their comments/feedback on the model to Foothills until 11/27/01 and another meeting to reach an agreement on economic model/toll was scheduled for 12/03/01 or 12/04/01. The data from economic/toll model will be used in commercial proposal/presentation to the ANS producers which ANNGTC intends to have by 12/20/01. Tim and I will review Foothills' cash flow and COS model and prepare comments.

Overall, the participants though that the current Foothills model ($0.43/MMBtu toll for Alaska section) has very aggressive assumptions in many ways, and it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after all the appropriate revisions are made. The following are the main discussion points of the meeting. Item 1 and 2 are expected to have a very large impact on the toll.

1) Capex and Opex need to have annual/monthly escalation (current model has 0% escalation). For example, Foothills sensitivity analysis shows that 2.5% Capex escalation would increase the toll by $0.20. Numbers such as 1.5% for Capex and 2.5% for Opex were thrown during the meeting, but more reviews need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates. Do you have any opinion on this, Bryan?

2) Foothills is using Flowthrough method (using cash taxes in COS calculation) to calculate income taxes that go into the Cost of Service and might be underestimating Cost of Service. Tim thought that the Flowthrough method will not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed by IRS and FERC. Foothills said that they can still have same toll under Normalized tax method by changing the depreciation number, but Tim was concerned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation. Foothills declined our request to share their Cost of Service model and insisted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the cash flow model. They agreed to provide a hard copy of their Cost of Service model in the end, but Tim and I were under impression that Foothills was trying to lower the toll as much as they can. Tim was also concerned about levelized toll approach because of FERC might lower allowed return in the later rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this. Please correct me if I am wrong here, Tim.

3) OM & A is currently estimated to be 1% of Capex but this might be too low (OM&A in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx. 1.5% of total Capex).

4) The Withdrawn Partners' historical contributions ($228 million) will be added to the Rate Base, but this might be dropped if necessary. Success fee of $40 million should be included in the project budget.

5) Working Capital will be added to the project cost. The Line Pack cost (14.5 Bcf for the whole section) was assumed to be borne by ANS producers but some participants highly doubted that that would be the case. The Line Pack gas might have to be bought by the Partnership or the Producers will at least demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for 25 years.

6) For Return on Capital and AFUDC, 14% ROE and 8% Interest on Debt assuming 30/70 capital structure is likely to be kept. However, the current drawdown schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginning, which will not be true. Certain assumptions should be made on the financial close date and commercial agreement/preliminary determination date to calculate AFUDC more accurately.

7) Current financing assumption in the model is a 25 year bank loan with balloon amortization and DSCR of 1.6. In reality, the initial bank loans will be of shorter maturity (5-15 years) and certain roll-over financing will be unavoidable. It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches with different terms, interest rate, seniority etc. 

8) There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of the ANGTS considering that some sources of capital, revenues and part of operating expenses will be in Canadian dollars. A mechanis to mitigate currency risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it.

9) Property taxes of 2% in Alaska seems high, but Property taxes during construction period should be added. 

Lastly, there is about $300 million difference ($4,336-$4035) between ETS current cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model, excluding IDC and AFUDC. Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for larger pipe size (46 or 48 inch) as noted in Bryan's email.

I had been interviewing for the open accountant position prior to leaving for vacation.  I have interviewed one internal and two external candidates.  I had indicated I would be notifying them this week of my hiring decision. The position needs to be filled for the following reasons:

Northern Border Partners has completed 3 major acquisitions this year and one at the end of third quarter last year.
We have been transitioning these companies to SAP this year resulting in significantly higher maintenance time for additional companies, all internal coding (Cost centers/FARorders), intercompany reconcilliations, account reconcilliations.
All companies are consolidated with Northern Border Partners requiring financial statement preparation
We will be bringing on Midwestern Gas Transmission Company effective January 1.  Their accounting in currently being done by El Paso through the end of the year.
We continue to be behind on certain routine activities, bank reconcilliations being the primary one.  With the additional companies, this has increased the level of activity in this area.
IPayit has created additional manual accounts payable processing due to issues with payment processing through the system.
All of the additional companies has resulted in additional wire transfer activity which is all entered manually in our department.
The acquisition of a Canadian operation has resulted in significant time required in working with the 3rd party that  is operating this facility as well as now requiring foreign currency translation.
New accounting requirements are requiring additional analysis and reporting requirements.

I am available to discuss any of the above issues at your convenience.

"Q3 Adjustments - AA&Co. Review","Rod, please forward this note to Mark Lindsey ASAP (I can't find his name on
our email address book and I've had trouble with sending him things in the
past).  

Attached is a file that includes unusual accounting adjustments and/or
implementation adjustments we're proposing as a result of our new rate case
order.  These adjustments total $31.3m (IBIT), and $29.8m (Net Income for Q3
2001.  Forecasted results for Q3 we've been sending to you (including our 3rd
Current Estimate) include these adjustments.   Accordingly, not getting AA&Co
concurence on any of these issues will have a negative impact on PGG's Q3
results. 

For entries affecting PGH & PVC (see tab), we need to make sure Enron Corp is
supportive of our treatment.  This is because although AA&Co. Portland will be
reviewing our records and our reasons for the adjustments, they will likely
pass on the AA&Co. Houston any of these items they may question.  This is
because their primary focus is PGE earnings, not PVC or PGH since we don't
report these companies out any place publicly on a stand-alone basis.  We've
passed along the Merger MOU proposal to AA&Co. Portland already since it has
ties to our rate order (and they're thinking about it), but we're waiting to
hear back from you that the other three items on the list are support by you,
then we'll pass them on to AA&Co Portland for review.  Please respond back by
next Monday, Sept 24th to allow us appropriate time to get them reviewed by
AA&Co. 

All the items on the PGE tab have been explained to AA&Co. Portland, and we're
hoping to get their position on these adjustments by next Monday, Sept 24.  We
feel we have good justification for all the adjustments, but some are more of
a stretch than others (when projecting whether or not AA&Co will approve
them).

Please call if you have any questions.  thanks

We expect to hear something on tues in regard to the extension of 2 weeks but will probably not know about the final fix until the 2nd week of dec

Why would we not sell the units even if the proceeds are trapped in rawhide as it would allow us to pay down debt ?

I agree that we do not want to announce anything publically until we understand where we are as it could hurt our bargaining position

Active Financial Deals	83	
Active Physical Positions	38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	345.0 	
VaR ($thousands)	159.4 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	0	
		


Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

As you may know, Transwestern and Northern entered into ""corporate separateness"" agreements as part of the recently completed $1 billion secured financing.  The gist of those agreements is that the ETS family of companies is subject to new restrictions on their interaction with the rest of Enron.  To assure compliance with these new obligations, I'd like to remove ETS personel from the OPI structure.  I don't have the full slate of officers and directors in front of me, but I do recall that Dave Neubauer took my old job as OPI president, and I believe Mary Kay Miller and several other ETS folks are still officers and/or directors.  Please give me a call at your earliest convenience to discuss.  Thanks.  DF

If this is true and Enron has conveyed these assets to a structured vehicle, then we have breached transfer obligations on almost every deal, our debt may be in default and we need to understand the consequences asap as Subic and Batangas are the subject of current negotiations.

Because of the nature of what they asked, I just wanted to keep you informed on this.  

Global Finance has requested models, historicals, timings for disposal on the Rawhide assets.  These assets include Subic, Batangas, Guam, Gaspart, Centragas, PQPC, and TGS.  I was going to get them the info on the models and ask for Carol Howes' help on the historicals.  If neccessary, I will also set them up with people over here who can help explain the valuations.

They have already spent quite a bit of money on hardware and need to get everything setup. There is a lot of work that needs to be done and was scheduled for last week.  I had Jonathan cancel this trip due to the travel freeze.  Both the airfare and Jonathan's Hotel will be direct billed to the JV.  The remainder of Jonathan's expenses should be under $500.  Can you please get this travel approved.

Jason,
 
As you are aware, we have been working for a while with Jonathan Perret on a project for installing new Exchange servers in all our 3 plants (Jose, San Joaqu?n and Santa B?rbara). At the same time,  we decided to install a Web Sense server in Caracas in order for us to manage the Internet access connection and an Intranet Web Server in Puerto La Cruz for Accroven Home Page. We have also modified and stabilized all our links so to improve the bandwidth used for our applications and for soon to be ""Voice over IP"" for the communication with all ours plants. All the hardware necessary to perform these actions were purchased (and received) by Accroven, all the software, purchased and received by Enron to be back-charge to Accroven.
 
Now, to complete this project, the following tasks must be perform with Jonathan assistance:
01) Build SACAR-APWS01 (Web Sense server in Caracas)

Subject:	Confidential - GSS Organization Value to ETS


Here are my thoughts on the value the GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) brings to ETS:

I believe totally in the concept of strategically sourcing our materials and services for ETS, which is the concept that GSS was founded under, while still within the ETS organization.  Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS.   The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are:

The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine.
Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000.
ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more.
New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's.
Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy).
GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing.
ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register.


If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals)

Two (2) negotiators - Contract Managers
Two (2) analysts
Two (2) contract administrators

The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC:

iBuyit System
Catalog system (part of iBuyit)
iPayit system

We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department.   This would take very few staff adds to make that happen.

Let me know if you need any further detail.

To:	Hayslett, Rod; Hughes, James A.; Horton, Stanley; Donahue, Jeff; Walls Jr., Rob
Subject:	Rawhide; Whitewing

Per our earlier discussion:

Rawhide - No prohibition on sale of assets.  TGS, CEG, Border (common units), Gaspart, Centragas and Subic/Batangas are primary assets in Rawhide.  EGF is in the process of restructuring deal prior to 12/14 deadline.  Demonstration of some velocity on the sale of these assets would be extremely beneficial in negotiations with banks.

Whitewing - Approval from investors needed if we sell below the Whitewing purchase price (book value).  Asset sales package would need to be prepared and sent to investors in Whitewing (Osprey) who then have 10 days to approve sale. Typically, this has not been a problem, however, circumstances have since changed.  Gordon McKillop manages this process for Enron.

I am familiar with both transactions have the contacts within Global Finance for additional detail if we need it.

I wonder if the person you spoke with is aware of the previous arrangements.  Do you get the funny feeling they are trying to distance themselves from us ???  Here is the excerpt from the original Enron invitation.  I have been attending these since the early nineties, and Enron has always been discounted 50%.  Even the full price they quoted you contradicts the October 12th memo that quotes a full price of $950:

Once again, due to the level of Enron 's attendance, we have arranged to
facilitate you or your group's registration.  If you would like to register
or would like more information, please contact Sabrina Whaley at 646-6340
by November 5, 2001.  A copy of the Symposium agenda has been attached for
your review.  The registration fee is $950 per person; however we offer all
Enron personnel wanting to attend a 50% discount.  All billing arrangements
will be made through Bob Butts.

For $1,200, I will cancel my reservations.

Thanks for checking.

Credit Data
I believe the write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Paul on this memo to confirm.

Financial Trading Risk Data
We provide aggregate position data for ETS not aggregate VAR, e.g.  ETS is long 10 MMCFD natural gas at Ventura for January 2002, etc. vs. ETS has $1.5 million total VAR.  This is necessary for two reasons: 1.) Enron's VAR does not necessarily equal the sum of its subsidiaries VAR since there may be offsetting positions  throughout the business units.  2.)  Our trading books software (Caminus) does not have the capability to compute VAR in accordance with the specific methodology required (Monte Carlo simulation) in the Enron policy.

1. E-Business: Yes, there's a lot of hype about Web services.

architecture really will transform your business overnight -
we all know better - but because if it lives up to its billing,
it could create a stronger value proposition for B2B e-commerce.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"FW: ETS Reimbursement For PGAS Project Cost","In light of all the events - do we want to pursue trying to charge ENW for the remaining $'s and have them deal with AEP or should ETS just absorb the $'s?   cvb

Subject:	FW: ETS Reimbursement For PGAS Project Cost

Your direction is needed.  ENA/ENW does not want to address the remaining PGAS project cost owed ETS until the asset is sold to AEP which probably won't happen this year.  They still owe us about $194,000 of project cost.  As I see it, they can either accept their amortization which will begin when we close the workorder or accept a final debit for the balance owed.   I prefer the latter and have suggested that to Tommy, but he needs to know why this would be necessary.  What are ETS requirements for this reimbursement.  

Sections in red below are related to this question.

Let me check into it.  Your point about it being capitalized cost is a good one.  I have been instructed to close the workorder on 12/31.  We may be able to just begin amortization to ENA for the remaining balance in Jan if that is preferred or we may be able to wait until a decision is reached on the sale of the system to AEP.  I'll get back to you.

Thanks again.

Mike:  AEP is currently implementing their version of SCADA and probably won't be live until the end of November.  We will probably be delivering POPS to them sometime in November.  I suspect that given these two items they may not want to take on PGAS until 1Q 2002 but I will try to confirm their plans.  

Can you help me to understand the urgency of ETS being fully paid in 2001.  Was the application capitalized and hasn't ENA already paid in excess of $300K for something that was capitalized or am I missing something?

Tommy, could I get an update on the sale of the PGAS asset to AEP.  Your last mention of this when I saw you at A&M indicated that it had become a lower priority.  I think my management is going to want ETS to be reimbursed for remaining cost owed it in 2001 one way or the other.  I would like to take them some current information.  I still think it would be most appropriate for ENA to reimburse us now since work is complete and since they own the asset. 

We had a conversation with the new AEP support person, Kevin Duffy, about support and transition today.  We were able to answer all his questions about architecture and support.  He was not aware of any transition plans or where they are with regard to any purchase.

Thanks

Subject: Consultant's view on gas transmission into California
Importance: High


Rod:

As we discussed here are the bulletts that summarize what we heard from our consultants.

Overall demand picture

Believe it will be 2006 before the California market will get back to 2000/2001 demand levels

          2002            demand down approximately 900 mmcf/d
          2003            demand will be flat
          2004            growth in demand will begin
          2005-2006   return to 2001 demand levels

Reasoning:
   2001 was a dry year - the lack of hydro generation created an additional 600 mmcf/d demand for gas in California
   Anticipated generation capacity overbuild in California - new more efficient power plants with better heat rates will displace older gas fired generation, reducing the amount of gas              required to generate a MW of electricity on the margin
   California electricity rate increases have curtailed demand for power and subsequently, gas

Gas transmission capacity into the state

Over the next two to three years there will be an additional 2.0 Bcf/d of transmission capacity into California
   800 mmcf/d in 2002
   900 mmcf/d in 2003 (Kern River expansion)
   300 mmcf/d               (El Paso conversion of All American oil line and power up)

San Juan basin gas

San Juan basin production is declining

   first half of 2001 vs. first half of 2000 production off by approximately 200 mmcf/d
   Rockies gas will not replace declining production in the San Juan San Juan gas will move closer to Permian pricing


The consultants believe that the combination of these factors will put decontracting pressure on existing transmission into the state of California, and especially the El Paso and Transwestern lines.

However, the ""wild card"" in their view is unforeseen California power demand growth.

As we discussed, JPMorgan would like to hear your views on the above issues.

Please give me a call when you have had sufficient time to digest and we can set up a conference call to make the most efficient use of your time.

Thanks Rod

Brent

Also, when you have had a chance to look at sales gas volume growth please
e-mail the volume numbers to me...thanks

We have the following new requests for L/Cs to cover our lease purchases.  They are requesting L/Cs because of the Enron situation.  I've spoken with some of them and they just won't budge.  

1.  Newfield Exploration		$3MM   	to cover Oct & Nov
2.  J. Cleo Thompson		$1.8MM to cover Oct & Nov 
3.  Apache Corp.		$700K     to cover Nov
4.  W. C. Miller			$175K     to cover Nov 

I've already spoken to Jesse Mata at Enron and she is telling me she cannot get any L/Cs issued - their banks are not allowing it.   I've got a call into Jack Insigna at Standard Chartered to see if they would be willing to EOTT's L/Cs.  He's checking.  

We could prepay Apache - they are obviously not a credit risk.  the others i'm not sure about - we're checking their credit.  

let me know about how much you're willing to with Enron.  thanks.  jc

As you are aware, ETS has committed to implementation of the Citibank purchasing card program.  We requested 20 cards, 30 days ago to be used in a pilot program.  In talking to Citibank, we were advised the cards are being held pending a review of Enron's credit.  

We currently are using Wright Express MasterCard.  We have ceased implementation of EDI with Wright Express because of the transition to Citibank.  At this time, we are in a serious dilemma with a working program with very costly manual invoice processing costs and a new program with Citibank that is on hold.

If you have contacts with Citibank who could assist us in moving our program forward, I would appreciate your assistance.  If we are unable to proceed with Citibank, we will need to spend the money and time to enhance our association with Wright Express.

Please call either John Gillespie (713-646-6222) or me.

From a valuation standpoint I assume Case 1 would give us the highest multiple.  The issue is is it doable?  We have achieved $600 million last year.  Also, before we go further with Project Armstrong I would like to get Whalley and Dynegy to agree that if the discussions are successful we would do the deal.  Let's suspend these discussions for the time being.

Rod,
Attached are three cases for Project Armstrong.  I know you're out of the office until Wednesday but I thought if you could respond by Blackberry or phone as to which case we should send to TCPL, I would get that to them before the holiday so they could work on it Thursday and Friday.

*	Case 1 is an 8% distribution growth case (starting with the plan and increasing acquisition activity to deliver 8% growth).  To achieve that our total capex for NBP goes up to an average of just over $400 million per year.
*	Case 2 tracks with our budget case and involves about $200 million in capex per year and results in 2 years of 8% growth and then a flat distribution level for the remaining 3 years.
*	Case 3 utilizes the budget case but eliminates all acquisitions (capex is about $30 - $40 million average per year for maintenance and asset development) and assumes NBPL recontracting occurs at 85% of max rates.  The result is distributions increase to $3.30 in 2002 and stay at that level throughout the 5 year period.

Obviously Case 1 is the most aggressive in terms of valuation among the three.  Please let me know if that is ok to send or do you have something else in mind.  Also I could fax hard copies if you would like...

"RE: Request to Open WSB C.007054.03.09","Jim, we need to get this cleared up in light of what has happened in recent weeks.  The remaining dollars are the last of the allocation for the share of the PGAS projects committed to by HPL and paid for by ETS.  HPL/AEP has been running in a PGAS stand alone production mode since October.  I do not want to do an invoice but would like to do an intercompany charge.  There already was a work order set up to accept the PGAS charges  - C.007054.  It seems to me that it would easier to have all the charges in one place to get reimbursement from AEP than to have them spread out all over.  The sale of HPL did not negate the obligation HPL/ENA had to ETS for the cost of this project.  Even when the sale was being contemplated in Dec 2000, Jan 2001 timeframe ENA told ETS to continue on with the project for HPL.

Lisa, it is my understanding that you are now in charge of ""old"" HPL projects per Karen Gruesen.  Project C.007054 is the old J50127 PGAS Software  Measurement project set up in 2000 to accept the allocation of PGAS charges for HPL's share of the project.  The PGAS project is an ETS/HPL project to replace the MIPS measurement system.  PGAS went into projection for both ETS and HPL/AEP June of this year.  This project has been allocated all but the final allocation of $194,000.  The previous allocations where charged to C.007054.03.09 through May of this year.  This WBS is not accepting charges so I assume that it is locked.  Please unlock it so that we can make the final allocation of HPL's share and close out ETS's PGAS project.  Please call Judy Lin (37193) when unlocked so she can make the entry and notify you when it is complete so that you may relock the WBS element.  Thank you for your help.

5. CIO Opinion: E-commerce can still work
6. Are you involved with CRM or ERP?

1. Sound Off: The question of whether the U.S. should support
Europe's ban on Internet hate speech is a loaded one indeed.
Europeans are concerned that homegrown bigots will ""outsource""
their racist websites by moving the hosting to American ISPs.
U.S. First Amendment advocates argue that a ban on hate speech
will start us down the slippery slope toward censorship. Should
the U.S. support the ban?

Commonwealth of Virginia, is available to offer his insight
and advice on the challenges of e-government.

of identical single-board computers into a rack, ultradense
servers are all about saving money by reducing real estate
needs and cutting power requirements.

4. CIO Legal: If you have the misfortune of being the CIO of

about the dotcom decline. But there are still good ideas
out there and, despite all the doom and gloom, this
e-commerce thing can still work.

Title: The West Enters a Bust 	
URL(s):

***********************************************************************

RADICAL SHIFT IN WESTERN MARKET DYNAMICS

The western power markets are entering a bust period as a result of the 24,000 
megawatts of power plant additions and demand decline brought on by last year's 
high prices and the current economic softness. This bust period is likely to 
last for several years. Western gas markets have also entered a bust with the 
delayed start to winter and full storage inventories exerting downward pressure 
on both North American prices and western basis differentials. Through the 
remainder of this year and into well into next, western regional gas and power 
markets will remain soft and possibly weaken further.

*  Power operating reserves should rise to above 15 percent by next summer in 
the Southwest and California, pushing power prices down and improving 
reliability.

*  Power demand is expected to shrink by 11 percent in the fourth quarter; 
market contractions will return demand in 2002 to levels experienced in 1998. 

*  Full gas storage inventories, huge declines in year-over-year demand, and 
the onset of significant pipeline capacity additions will keep a lid on West 
Coast differentials.

"RE: PGE Dividend","Greg:

I do not have any access to information regarding PGE retained earnings. 

As we discussed this morning, distributions of cash in the form of dividends will be subject to a tax of approximately 7%.  This tax can be avoided completely if the distributions of cash take the form of intercompany loans which are settled at the close of the sale of PGE. Significant tax research and intercompany briefings took place on this very topic in July and August of this year.  The procedures for settlement of the loans are already baked into the PGE purchase and sale agreement. It is my understanding that some loans of cash have already been made under this procedure, but I am the wrong person to talk to about PGE issues or that sort.  Rod Hayslett would have more information. 
 
Jim Ginty is the appropriate tax department contact for PGE Purchase and Sale Agreement issues. 

Regards, 

Alicia Goodrow

Alicia,

Do we know / can we quantify the amount of undistributed/retained earnings as of Sepetmber 30th, and what the tax impact would be of distributing that amount.

Thanks again.

I had heard something similar.  We should probably get alicia to quantify exactly how much the leakage would be {in dollars} and how the mechanics would work.  Please tell alicia that we understand that this would be a whalley, mcmahon, causey decision.  We are only trying to identify options and quantify breakage and leakage.

Thanks very much for the update keep me posted.
William W. Brown

"RE: Andersen Oil & Gas Symposium","I wonder if the person you spoke with is aware of the previous arrangements.  Do you get the funny feeling they are trying to distance themselves from us ???  Here is the excerpt from the original Enron invitation.  I have been attending these since the early nineties, and Enron has always been discounted 50%.  Even the full price they quoted you contradicts the October 12th memo that quotes a full price of $950:

Once again, due to the level of Enron 's attendance, we have arranged to
facilitate you or your group's registration.  If you would like to register
or would like more information, please contact Sabrina Whaley at 646-6340
by November 5, 2001.  A copy of the Symposium agenda has been attached for
your review.  The registration fee is $950 per person; however we offer all
Enron personnel wanting to attend a 50% discount.  All billing arrangements
will be made through Bob Butts.

For $1,200, I will cancel my reservations.

Thanks for checking.

After Rod's staff mtg. on Friday, we followed up w Andersen on attendance discounts related to the above annual meeting (12/4 and 5).
Andersen indicated no discount...interested attendees would have to pay full amount, $1200.
