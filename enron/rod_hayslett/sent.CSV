Subject:	EOTT Conference Call - Enron related questions

On Tuesday we will have an EOTT conference call with investors to discuss EOTT's third quarter earnings.  I am concerned about some questions that may be asked relating to Enron.  Here is my stab at answering certain questions.  Please review and let me have your comments as soon as you can.  I would like to distribute on Friday the complete conference call script and Q&A that will include these answers.  Thanks


1.  Why did Enron sell its stake in EOTT?
Enron decided in September of 2001 to monetize its ownership in EOTT (other than its 2% general partner ownership) which consisted of 3.3 million common units, 7 million subordinated units and $9.3 million additional partnership units. The monetization was recognized as a sale for book purposes and a financing for tax purposes.  Enron retained voting and dispositive power with respect to these interest.  Enron, being deemed a control person, filed the appropriate SEC documents with repect to this transaction.

2.   Does Enron still have an economic reason to care about the price of EOTT stock?
As the general partner, Enron has a fiduciary responsiblity to act in the best interest of the unitholders of the partnership.    [I like your answer for simplicity sake, however in the interest of full disclosure here's more:  the pricing of the transaction was based upon a floor price with a final price for the units to be established at the conversion date of the sub units and the apis.    So besides the fiduciary responsibility, there is the fact that the final pricing on the deal has not occurred yet.]

3.  What is Enron's ownership of EOTT?
From a voting and dispositive power standpoint, it is 39%.

4.  Is the general partnership for sale? 
You will need to ask Enron that question.
[Enron filed a 13D on September 6, 2001, stating the following:
""It is Enron's intention to review the disposition of and to possibly dispose of all or a portion of its direct and indirect interest in the partnerhip (including the common units and its interest in the general partner).""]

5.  What impact does Enron's current situation have on EOTT?
[Two areas need to be addressed here - the tolling agreement and EOTT's ability to obtain three party bank financing.  I have EOTT to address these two questions.]

We have the following new requests for L/Cs to cover our lease purchases.  They are requesting L/Cs because of the Enron situation.  I've spoken with some of them and they just won't budge.  

1.  Newfield Exploration		$3MM   	to cover Oct & Nov
2.  J. Cleo Thompson		$1.8MM to cover Oct & Nov 
3.  Apache Corp.		$700K     to cover Nov
4.  W. C. Miller			$175K     to cover Nov 

I've already spoken to Jesse Mata at Enron and she is telling me she cannot get any L/Cs issued - their banks are not allowing it.   I've got a call into Jack Insigna at Standard Chartered to see if they would be willing to EOTT's L/Cs.  He's checking.  

We could prepay Apache - they are obviously not a credit risk.  the others i'm not sure about - we're checking their credit.  

let me know about how much you're willing to with Enron.  thanks.  jc

Rod,

I spoke to Jack Insinga of Standard Chartered yesterday. He specifically needs to speak to someone with Enron who can address the EOTT situation from Enron's perspective.  I told hiim I thought you were the best person for this discussion. We are having a bank meeting next Friday a.m. , November 9th and perhaps sometime prior to that would be a good time to meet.

All of the banks are looking for more information before they will do anything for us so realistically I am not optimistic that BNP Paribas will change their credit view at this time.  Hopefully after the banks have had time to digest the bank meeting information, credit committees will calm down a bit.

Thanks, Kelly

Rod I do not have Kelly Boots e-mail address and am traveling today without a phone directory... but I wanted to share or at least ask that we treat Standard Chartered real nice as we go through this crisis.  These guys are stepping up for us in every way....they (along with ING) are 100% behind us and are putting their money on it.  Also BNP Pays Bas is having an awful time with their credit committee...the business people have approved this and do not feel that Enron's problem effects us but the credit committee is not so forgiving.  If Kelly or anyone can do anything to help Paysbas in this situation it would be greatly appreciated.   My account executive there is Lincoln Payton and Marci Weiss...

Would you be so kind as to pass this along to Kelly or anyone else that you feel appropriate?

Subject:	Quick Note

Stan,

Knowing that your schedule is tight, I wanted to drop you a not on two items;

1) I have had a couple discussions with Rod on the finance/accounting organization for Wind.  I understand that Adam is pushing for a new full-time CFO including a CFO for Europe.  Being open, Adam and I have different views on the direction of the organization.  My view is that many functions should be supported by the Enron infrastructure (including treasury, cash-management, insurance, IT, etc.).  Adam would prefer to stay autonomous and is attempting to direct initiatives to that end.  I continue to push the organization in the course that I believe makes most sense.  While we are both professionals, this situation does create a conflict.  In my opinion, the most serious issues in this business are not financial, they are operational and commercial.  I'll continue to work with Rod, but would be glad to discuss with you in further detail.

2) I understand that Steve Hotte is transferring to Wholesale and you are looking at several candidates.  I would like to offer you input on two candidates that I have had considerable experience with.  Both are worthy of serious consideration, and both capable of meeting your needs.

Everett Plante - I recruited Everett into Enron from a fairly high position at Compaq.  Initially he was in Enron International.  After the dissolution of EI he rolled into corporate for a short time, subsequently, I helped get him moved into EBS.  He was thought of very highly.  He has great organization skill and a practical view on technology.  He has been through several organizations since coming to Enron and he has adeptly dealt with change.

Andrew Parsons - Andrew has worked for me on Y2K and in his current role in IT Compliance.  Andrew has great interpersonal and teamwork skills.  He is very focused and goal oriented.  Andrew is currently a Sr. Director, but will be up for VP at yearend.  While not as experienced as Everett, Andrew has a lot of potential.  I know that Causey also thinks highly of Andrew.

Tod

PS -  I am always open to buying lunch.

FYI, we received the signed copy from Williams today on MOPS.

Steve Dowd called me about the sale of our interest in Trailblazer.  He wanted to know if we were valuing the interest would we treat it differently because we are buying the partnership interest?  Would we treat the depreciation differently at the partnership level than the asset level?  For example, if the asset sold for $110, but the partnership valued it at $100, how would we account for the $10 difference, assuming these figures represented ENE's interest in the assets?

Thanks,

Ray,

Thanks for the feedback.  We'll get started right away.  With regard to the points below:

1 - I agree.  Divestitures, like acquisitions, require DASHs. 

2 - This should not be a problem.  The only rep. that I believe we'll have to give is that we own the note free and clear of any liens.  The rep. will be given by the holder of the note, Enron Caribe, Ltd.

3 - I will have to confirm sure that the buyers are still interested on buying the note.  I will let you know as soon as I know.  I have been talking to Michael Bax, Basic Energy - they own equity interest on the plant, and Humberto Sangiovanni with Banco Popular, a local Dominican bank.  People from EGA are aware of these individuals.

 I'll keep everyone posted and will get someone from EGA to help so that they can be in the loop.

Dan, 

Rod Hayslett has agreed to support the sale of the Haina note.  Please proceed. 

1)      I want a DASH on the transaction.  RAC signoff on any asset sales is policy.  I view the sale of a note as policy.

2)      I want to make sure that Enron is not making any substantive reps or warranties that could bite us. 
3)      I want to know who the buyer is.

The attached includes the standard economic analsyses for Phase VI. 

<<Synopsis Phase 62.xls>> 

The pertinent worksheets are: Capital, Economics on Total Capital, and Detailed Leveraged Books Grossed Up.  The last item includes the working capital impact.  For consistency with prior analyses, the total capital economics do not.  

One other twist:  Rather than use the equity AFUDC as non- cash, I recalculated the ""AFUDC"" using real life short term interest to come up with a more realistic estimate of the total cash requirements.

FYI, there are a couple of other worksheets in the workbook.  Among them is one for the the leveraged books on a non-grossed up basis.  I did this primarily to make sure that there were no busts, since the results must come out the same whether or not you gross up.

Rod, 

I can keep Rutherford assisting me with process reviews probably indefinitely...but, they are expensive, and frankly, over the last 3 to 4 weeks, because of the ENE stock crisis, and related pipeline debt support activities, we've lost process improvement project momentum. I believe I can restart a continuous improvement effort relatively quickly thru a internal ""steering committee"" after things settle down a bit.
 
As a result, I would recommend we go ahead and have Rutherford timely close out their projects. 

I have drafted a notification below.

Pursuant to our agreement, please accept this as 30 day notification of Enron Transportation Services (ETS) decision to end its relationship with Rutherford Consulting, Inc.

In that regard we request that all projects, currently underway, except the ""E&C Value Assessment""  be discontinued. We request

Pam,
As you know, we negotiated a deal for EOGR to take over our recently vacated space at 3AC 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21. We also negotiated a deal for them to purchase only the Teknion workstations which were already in the spaces on Levels 17-20 (not 21 furniture). The total purchase price is $205,000. plus all taxes.

I've been informed that the former EI groups report up to ETS. Therefore, the Bill of Sale shall be signed by an officer in ETS (Rod Hayslett), not EPSC. The Bill of Sale has been prepared by our legal team and is ready for Rod Hayslett to sign. I would like to get the document to you for signature and over to EOGR for signature by Friday, 11/9/01.

Let me know if you need anything further.

Thanks,
Reggie

Subject:	Confidential - GSS Organization Value to ETS


Here are my thoughts on the value the GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) brings to ETS:

I believe totally in the concept of strategically sourcing our materials and services for ETS, which is the concept that GSS was founded under, while still within the ETS organization.  Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS.   The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are:

*	The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine.
*	Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000.
*	ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more.
*	New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's.
*	Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy).
*	GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing.
*	ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register.


If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals)

*	Two (2) negotiators - Contract Managers
*	Two (2) analysts
*	Two (2) contract administrators

The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC:

*	iBuyit System
*	Catalog system (part of iBuyit)
*	iPayit system

We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department.   This would take very few staff adds to make that happen.

Let me know if you need any further detail.

Jim -

I'm afraid I have another ""to do"" for you.  Given the potential for all of
the overhang issues and given the significance of the receivables from the
parent, we developed some pro-forma balance sheets for NNG and TW, which
are attached.  These assume:

   The note receivable from parent company continues to be classified as
   current (represents net of all prior cash flows between NNG/TW and
   parent)
   The only borrowings under the revolvers relate to draw downs to repay
   the Citibank bank debt assumed by NNG and TW

We have highlighted in red the critical numbers. Given the overhang issues
at Enron Corp. I have the following questions:
   Should the note receivable from parent be classified as current? (i.e.
   would Enron truly be able to pay this amount to NNG/TW if needed)
   How will the debt be repaid in one year if Enron Corp.'s note receivable
   is not available to the pipelines?  Would you be able to draw down
   additional debt?
   Basically, what is the plan?
   Is the only debt expected to be drawn on these revolvers the assumed
   debt?  How much more in addition, if any?

Here is the basic plan, if something were to happen so that Enron was unable to pay NNG /TW back in time, then the notes with the bank would be transformed into term deals (length to be determined later).     The banks are comfortable that the ability to repay the notes exists in the pipes from the existing and projected cash flows of the entities.     There is no question that we should be able to borrow more against the pipes, with market multiples at 9X EBITDA and lenders willing to lend against it, there never has been a problem in that regard.   The securitizations of course will prevent the same kind of deals being done, but they are really to protect the banks from an Enron credit event (preference issues).


(See attached file: NNG FS pro forma.xls)(See attached file: TW FS pro
forma.xls)


I have to believe that the banks did this before agreeing to extend so much
credit - you might want to check around and see who provided this to the
banks rather than re-creating the wheel (Kevin Howard maybe).

Subject: Toll Model Review Meeting Updates



The model review meeting on Thursday went well, and the consensus was that there are many changes to be made to the current Foothills economic model. Many assumptions in the current model were challenged by the participant companies. Foothills agreed to reflect the suggested changes to the model (Andy is supposed to send out a summary of the discussion) and provided an electronic copy of the model for withdrawn partners' review. Withdrawn partners agreed to give their comments/feedback on the model to Foothills until 11/27/01 and another meeting to reach an agreement on economic model/toll was scheduled for 12/03/01 or 12/04/01. The data from economic/toll model will be used in commercial proposal/presentation to the ANS producers which ANNGTC intends to have by 12/20/01. Tim and I will review Foothills' cash flow and COS model and prepare comments.

Overall, the participants though that the current Foothills model ($0.43/MMBtu toll for Alaska section) has very aggressive assumptions in many ways, and it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after all the appropriate revisions are made. The following are the main discussion points of the meeting. Item 1 and 2 are expected to have a very large impact on the toll.

1) Capex and Opex need to have annual/monthly escalation (current model has 0% escalation). For example, Foothills sensitivity analysis shows that 2.5% Capex escalation would increase the toll by $0.20. Numbers such as 1.5% for Capex and 2.5% for Opex were thrown during the meeting, but more reviews need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates. Do you have any opinion on this, Bryan?

2) Foothills is using Flowthrough method (using cash taxes in COS calculation) to calculate income taxes that go into the Cost of Service and might be underestimating Cost of Service. Tim thought that the Flowthrough method will not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed by IRS and FERC. Foothills said that they can still have same toll under Normalized tax method by changing the depreciation number, but Tim was concerned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation. Foothills declined our request to share their Cost of Service model and insisted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the cash flow model. They agreed to provide a hard copy of their Cost of Service model in the end, but Tim and I were under impression that Foothills was trying to lower the toll as much as they can. Tim was also concerned about levelized toll approach because of FERC might lower allowed return in the later rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this. Please correct me if I am wrong here, Tim.

3) OM & A is currently estimated to be 1% of Capex but this might be too low (OM&A in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx. 1.5% of total Capex).

4) The Withdrawn Partners' historical contributions ($228 million) will be added to the Rate Base, but this might be dropped if necessary. Success fee of $40 million should be included in the project budget.

5) Working Capital will be added to the project cost. The Line Pack cost (14.5 Bcf for the whole section) was assumed to be borne by ANS producers but some participants highly doubted that that would be the case. The Line Pack gas might have to be bought by the Partnership or the Producers will at least demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for 25 years.

6) For Return on Capital and AFUDC, 14% ROE and 8% Interest on Debt assuming 30/70 capital structure is likely to be kept. However, the current drawdown schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginning, which will not be true. Certain assumptions should be made on the financial close date and commercial agreement/preliminary determination date to calculate AFUDC more accurately.

7) Current financing assumption in the model is a 25 year bank loan with balloon amortization and DSCR of 1.6. In reality, the initial bank loans will be of shorter maturity (5-15 years) and certain roll-over financing will be unavoidable. It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches with different terms, interest rate, seniority etc. 

8) There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of the ANGTS considering that some sources of capital, revenues and part of operating expenses will be in Canadian dollars. A mechanis to mitigate currency risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it.

9) Property taxes of 2% in Alaska seems high, but Property taxes during construction period should be added. 

Lastly, there is about $300 million difference ($4,336-$4035) between ETS current cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model, excluding IDC and AFUDC. Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for larger pipe size (46 or 48 inch) as noted in Bryan's email.

The 10Q describes Rawhide - although it does not list investments, it does reference domestic and international assets.  I assume we can use the same disclosure as is shown in the Q.  When you get back, we can talk more about it.  Any time constraint on this (other than the obvious need for cash)? I hope Jerry hasn't mandated anyone just yet (especially Citi/Solly).

The issue is that in order to sell the units there is a public disclosure of the units being in rawhide which may have some more issues.  A 13d filing is required.  If we want to sell then we need to file and wait.

Based upon our conversation, I agree that we s/not need to have any immediate disclosure over Enron's ability to perform - OK, Main Issue Done! 

However, I do feel that we should address/consider, before issuing the 10-Q, whether we need a written confirmation from Enron of their intention to meet EOTT's LC needs estimated to be in a range of $200-$400mm.

We have the following new requests for L/Cs to cover our lease purchases.  They are requesting L/Cs because of the Enron situation.  I've spoken with some of them and they just won't budge.  

1.  Newfield Exploration		$3MM   	to cover Oct & Nov
2.  J. Cleo Thompson		$1.8MM to cover Oct & Nov 
3.  Apache Corp.		$700K     to cover Nov
4.  W. C. Miller			$175K     to cover Nov 

I've already spoken to Jesse Mata at Enron and she is telling me she cannot get any L/Cs issued - their banks are not allowing it.   I've got a call into Jack Insigna at Standard Chartered to see if they would be willing to EOTT's L/Cs.  He's checking.  

We could prepay Apache - they are obviously not a credit risk.  the others i'm not sure about - we're checking their credit.  

let me know about how much you're willing to with Enron.  thanks.  jc

Rod,

I agree with Kenneth Cessac's response.  We should evaluate our current process for collecting, validating and distributing measurement data and consider new ideas and alternatives to improve the process.  Assistance from a consulting firm that specializes in this area would probably be better than using Rutherford.

This question has been raised several times over the past 10+ years, should we combine GMS, Field Operations, and some of the Gas Control functions to create a single source for measurement data.  I do not feel that changing a reporting relationship would correct any problems.  

I feel the time and effort can e better spent improving our current data collect process and data flow between SCADA and PGAS.  While this process is working I feel that it requires to much manual intervention and handling.  The IT department, Measurement Technology, Gas Control Hot Seat, and the Data Analysis are all involved in keeping the data flowing between SCADA and PGAS.  We should step back and re look and the current process and see what improvements can be made to better control and maintain this process.

 A second area that should be looked at is the data validation process.  Currently Field Operations, Data Analysis, and GMS all  manually review measurement data.  With all of the computer and software technology available I feel that we could easily automate most of the current manual data validation.

I have limited experience with the Rutherford company and what they could provide towards improving these items.  I feel that a company that specializes in SCADA and such as UTSI would be a better option.

Subject:	RE: Need for Rutherford Consullting Complete

The PGAS reporting project recently completed requirements gathering meetings with data users in gas measurement technology, gas control, gms, gas accounting, and gas logistics.  We think, those discussions have pointed to a need to assess inefficiencies that appear to exist related to data integrity as data moves between systems and users that span the entire gas volume/quality collection, transformation and delivery process.  In other words there seem to be too many questions and reconcilliations that people have to address along the process as data changes hands and is used for different internal and external purposes.  There also appears to be a lack of a single point of responsibility in the organization for gas volume data from start to finish.
The PGAS reporting project proposed to assess this at a high level and make some recommendations.  But as important as the issue appears to be, you might want to consider using Rutherford to help ETS do a more thorough job of this.
This effort would extend outside FA&A.
Please advise.

Mike, Ellis and I are in agreement that the need for the Rutherford Consulting group is complete.  Rutherford achieved what their goal was; to provide structure and format for the PGAS issues to be addressed in an efficient manner.  The procedures for listing new issues are in place and are being followed by the team.  The meetings are efficient in that only status updates and priorities are reviewed and discussed. There is now only one list for all issues that are being addressed or need to be addressed and they are prioritized.   The monthly meetings are now only needed twice a month.  What is the procedure for notifying Rutherford that their services are no longer needed on this project as they have completed what was asked of them?   cvb

Both positions are essential to supporting E&C project work loads. 

The pipe buying has been temporarily moved to Josh Mayes.  He can support the work for a short time but this is not optimal because of his current work load.  We need an experienced pipe buyer rather than a generalist.  

The GTB project expediting was placed within EEOS because we did not have the staff to handle the work.  EEOS indicated they had the experienced staff and time available so Lisa hired them.  The performance has not been satisfactory.  We are concerned that the project will be impacted if we don't take steps to reassign the work.   

We also need approval to move offices.  Ruth Ann needs approval to move Tyrone, add a hub to his office, move two expeditors to Tyrone's office thus freeing up two spaces in the procurement office.

Morris:

I have two positions I would like to fill.  The first is a Pipe Buyer.  I have interviewed both internal and external candidates and my first choice is an external candidate.  He has excellent experience as a project buyer and solid experience in buying pipe both in mill quantities and distributor quantities.  Another fully qualified internal candidate for this position has withdrawn his application as he has decided to stay at EES.  My next choice would be an EBS buyer with good purchasing experience but no pipe experience.  There might be ramifications for bringing in a buyer with no pipe experience to replace the previous Pipe Buyer if he is eventually terminated.

The second position is an expediter for the Red Rock and GTB projects.  This work is currently being handled in EEOS.  I would like to bring in Debbie Hinkle who is currently in redeployment from the Methanol Plant. 

Both of this positions will be fully charged out to the projects.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Rod,

After hearing the discussion on tighter restrictions and enforcement of ""Market Affiliate"" rules on the pipelines, should we be evaluating how we interface with GSS and SourceNet.   We openly share information on upcoming projects and strategies, at least with GSS.

Sounds like with the direction we are headed over the next several months, what division or subsidiaries are going to be left to buy materials or develop service contracts, other than ETS?   Should GSS be moved under ETS?    If so, it is way to big, just to cover our needs.

Any thoughts?

Subject: RE: PGE Dividend


Greg:

I do not have any access to information regarding PGE retained earnings.


As we discussed this morning, distributions of cash in the form of
dividends will be subject to a tax of approximately 7%.  This tax can be
avoided completely if the distributions of cash take the form of
intercompany loans which are settled at the close of the sale of PGE.
Significant tax research and intercompany briefings took place on this
very topic in July and August of this year.  The procedures for
settlement of the loans are already baked into the PGE purchase and sale
agreement. It is my understanding that some loans of cash have already
been made under this procedure, but I am the wrong person to talk to
about PGE issues or that sort.  Rod Hayslett would have more
information.=20

Jim Ginty is the appropriate tax department contact for PGE Purchase and
Sale Agreement issues.=20

Alicia,

Do we know / can we quantify the amount of undistributed/retained
earnings as of Sepetmber 30th, and what the tax impact would be of
distributing that amount.

Thanks again.

I had heard something similar.  We should probably get alicia to
quantify exactly how much the leakage would be {in dollars} and how the
mechanics would work.  Please tell alicia that we understand that this
would be a whalley, mcmahon, causey decision.  We are only trying to
identify options and quantify breakage and leakage.

Thanks very much for the update keep me posted.

We have the following new requests for L/Cs to cover our lease purchases.  They are requesting L/Cs because of the Enron situation.  I've spoken with some of them and they just won't budge.  

1.  Newfield Exploration		$3MM   	to cover Oct & Nov
2.  J. Cleo Thompson		$1.8MM to cover Oct & Nov 
3.  Apache Corp.		$700K     to cover Nov
4.  W. C. Miller			$175K     to cover Nov 

I've already spoken to Jesse Mata at Enron and she is telling me she cannot get any L/Cs issued - their banks are not allowing it.   I've got a call into Jack Insigna at Standard Chartered to see if they would be willing to EOTT's L/Cs.  He's checking.  

We could prepay Apache - they are obviously not a credit risk.  the others i'm not sure about - we're checking their credit.  

let me know about how much you're willing to with Enron.  thanks.  jc

Subject: Enron Wind Aviation



Adam / Stan,

I had a follow-up meeting with Gary Fitch regarding Enron Wind's aviation.  Gray indicated the following:

*	Aviation budget number look comparable to operator standards (approx. $1,900 / hour, 600 hour estimate)
*	The plane has a market value of $1.8 - $2.0 million and a book value of $2.2 million
*	Turbo prop charters for trips to Tehachapi would run in excess of $1,100 / hour and may be limited as there are only two qualified operators
*	The Cessna is the only jet suitable for use to Tehachapi based on runway length and altitude
*	Gary will make a site visit before the end of the year

Assuming that of the budgeted 600 hours of operation, only 400 hours would require charter, the cost of charter would approach $0.5 million of the total budget of $1.2 million.  This plus the flexibility of using the plan on longer hauls (e.g., to Houston) make it economically justified.

My recommendation is that based on the current situation, we retain the aircraft.

Tod

Even though a number of us are swamped with work related to the issues Enron is currently facing, progress has been made in three of the priority areas.

The purpose of the first Steering Committee meeting was to review (1)team members and (2)plans for the first 30 days.  For those teams who have named a lead (Reporting, Communications, and Human Capital), George Wasaff and I propose that we continue with the status meeting originally scheduled for November 1 from 10-11:30 with those team leads who are able to participate (Jan Johnson, Carol Howes, and I) and any Steering Committee members who are available.  Documentation indicating team members and plans can be made available to those unable to attend.

The five priority areas were expected to move at different speeds, so we can initiate the other two teams once time permits.

Please let me know if you are able to participate, and/or if you have any problems with this proposed path forward.

Thanks!

She has not responded.   We cannot proceed with the Northern Border implementation without a confidentiality agreement between ENA and NBP.  

Caminus is still looking to set up a meeting for gathering requirements for both NBP and possibly the Risk Analytics package.

Sally,

In March of 1999, ETS companies, Northern Natural Gas (NNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (TW), signed Confidentiality Agreements with Enron Capital and Trade (ECT) for pricing information.  You were the signatory for ECT at that time.  These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes.  Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.  However, the Confidentiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any other companies.  I would appreciate any assistance you could provide in identifying the new person at ENA/EWS that would handle these duties currently.

Thanks

I am not very comfortable with that at all.  I think with the filing of the proxy that we would have a disclosure issue..  It could also call into question whether or not Enron plans to perform under the MTBE deal. I do not think we need a letter though.  A letter agreement already exists between the two companies.  Another alternative would be for EOTT to go get there own LC,s and have Enron pick-up the cost.  That would keep EOTT's unitholders indifferent.

2.  J. Cleo Thompson		$1.8MM to cover Oct & Nov 
3.  Apache Corp.		$700K     to cover Nov
4.  W. C. Miller			$175K     to cover Nov 

I've already spoken to Jesse Mata at Enron and she is telling me she cannot get any L/Cs issued - their banks are not allowing it.   I've got a call into Jack Insigna at Standard Chartered to see if they would be willing to EOTT's L/Cs.  He's checking.  

We could prepay Apache - they are obviously not a credit risk.  the others i'm not sure about - we're checking their credit.  

let me know about how much you're willing to with Enron.  thanks.  jc

How does this look?

 

Also, I did change some numbers in the excel spreadsheet:

	The Ignacio to Blanco subscription levels were pulling from the row excluding ROFR capacity in the supporting sheet.  I changed it to be consistent with the other 	capacities (which include ROFR capacity).

	Shelley had made some assumptions about East of Thoreau capacity subscription, such as, the USGT 400,000/d contract would remain subscribed (it doesn't 	have ROFR) and she had included the extension of 2-3 other contracts that don't have ROFR.  These contracts were then dropped after 2005.  I continued the 	extensions through 2006.

	I changed the East of Thoreau capacity to 750,000/d from 850,000/d.

Would you please forward me the CAPEX numbers when Tracy e-mails them to you?  Jayshree indicated that she needs those numbers and it will be easier to send in soft form.

Also, to confirm the numbers in the information you gave me are 30.86 MM for 2001 (this does not include Red Rock) and $68.4 in 2002 (this includes $47 MM for Red Rock).  I am assuming that on page three of the 2001-2003 projections that really captures 2002-2004 the operations numbers are in 000s not millions as noted above.  If this is true you have 15 billion in operations CAPEX - which I don't believe is true.  Let me know.

Subject:	Karen Choyce

I will give you some comments on the Service Agreement (from Mary Perkins) on Monday.

I talked with Karen Choyce:

Some wire are paid by Ipayit.  But I think we all agreed that there are adequate controls in Ipayit already.

Karen's group handles other wires, many of the high value wires.  Maggie's interest and principal payment wires are probably paid by Karen's group.  Karen has three people who process the wires, none of which are dedicated to any particular Enron company.  They each process wires across all of Enron's entities.  The volume of Citrus/FGT's wires are not enough to justify one person's time.

In the Enron Policies, Approval Authorizations for Cash Disbursements on the Web, there is a Policy and list of authorized approvers.  There is a signature on file for each of these persons.  When Karen's people get a wire request form (and they are all on paper with orignial signatures, nothing electronic) they follow the Policy and note the appropriate signature applies.  They will check a signature to the approved signature on file if necessary.  Karen Choyce has the authority to change coding but not approval for payment.  I would guess there are enough coding errors that she needs that power.  Karen's people then input into SAP from which Mary Perkins' group makes the payments.

I did notice that Mike Moran and Rock Meyer are still on the Website Approval list.  You might want to consider adding Maggie to the above $1.0 MM approval list.

I mentioned to her the idea that we might institute a second level of approvals for wires but not the idea that we might take this function over in Citrus/FGT ourselves.

Recommendation:  Since this does not appear to be a full-time job to process Citrus/FGT wires, we could save some Corporate Charge dollars and find someone in Citrus/FGT who might be underutilized to do this function.

I received a call from Jim Guest at the FERC OCA this afternoon concerning the Enron situation.  He had read the articles and heard the reports.  Wanted to know if bad accounting was the root of the problem.  I advised him that it was bad investments that was the real issue. He asked about the use of the pipeline assets to pull Enron thru the liquidity crisis.  I gave him a brief overview of the Dynegy cash infusion and the bank revolvers.  He said there was some concern at the FERC that projects we might be proposing may not be able to be funded due to the reduced ability of the pipelines to obtain outside financing due to the securitization of the all the assets.  I indicated that it was my opinion that good investments in pipeline facilities would probably be looked on favorably at Enron these days.

Thought you?d want a quick update.  I haven?t advised Drew or Greg Porter yet.  Thought you might want to cover with them.

Subject: Consultant's view on gas transmission into California
Importance: High


Rod:

As we discussed here are the bulletts that summarize what we heard from our consultants.

Overall demand picture

Believe it will be 2006 before the California market will get back to 2000/2001 demand levels

          2002            demand down approximately 900 mmcf/d
          2003            demand will be flat
          2004            growth in demand will begin
          2005-2006   return to 2001 demand levels

Reasoning:
   2001 was a dry year - the lack of hydro generation created an additional 600 mmcf/d demand for gas in California
   Anticipated generation capacity overbuild in California - new more efficient power plants with better heat rates will displace older gas fired generation, reducing the amount of gas              required to generate a MW of electricity on the margin
   California electricity rate increases have curtailed demand for power and subsequently, gas

Gas transmission capacity into the state

Over the next two to three years there will be an additional 2.0 Bcf/d of transmission capacity into California
   800 mmcf/d in 2002
   900 mmcf/d in 2003 (Kern River expansion)
   300 mmcf/d               (El Paso conversion of All American oil line and power up)

San Juan basin gas

San Juan basin production is declining

   first half of 2001 vs. first half of 2000 production off by approximately 200 mmcf/d
   Rockies gas will not replace declining production in the San Juan San Juan gas will move closer to Permian pricing


The consultants believe that the combination of these factors will put decontracting pressure on existing transmission into the state of California, and especially the El Paso and Transwestern lines.

However, the ""wild card"" in their view is unforeseen California power demand growth.

As we discussed, JPMorgan would like to hear your views on the above issues.

Please give me a call when you have had sufficient time to digest and we can set up a conference call to make the most efficient use of your time.

Thanks Rod

Brent

Also, when you have had a chance to look at sales gas volume growth please
e-mail the volume numbers to me...thanks

   Subject: Confidential - Decision tree on projects

   Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting.

   There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and
   thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama
   and Gaza.  In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have
   taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies
   and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the
   loans.  SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem.  Panama is much less
   (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be
   sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year.  Note that, in
   Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is
   non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM.  In the past, we have
   discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to
   potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama.
   The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from actions taken
   by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with private
   parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which
   although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a ""mark"" on
   the company's liquidity position.

   Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in
   Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken
   or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an
   effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor
   confidence?  The same could go for SECLP and Gaza.

   This is simply an overall ""guidance"" question.  Let's take it up during
   our staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you.

   Many thanks, Mariella

Subject:	FW: Deconsolidation of Dabhol if Enron's shares are increased to 65%


FYI -

Bechtel has requested that the agenda for the DPC board meeting next week include a vote to issue the Phase II shares.  Once the shares are issued, Enron will have 65% voting rights and will be able to control the matters which require majority consents (the memo attached below contains a summary of such matters).

Mary Cilia and I had worked with Mike Jones (AA) on this a few months ago and he had agreed that we could avoid consolidation of DPC by entering into a legally binding side letter with GE and Bechtel waiving our majority consent rights and agreeing to vote as a block with them on such matters.  AA's concurrence is subject to their review the side letter and confirmation that it is legally binding.

Jeff Sommers and I are scheduling a meeting with Mike Jones for tomorrow to ensure that the previously reached conclusion still stands.

Subject:	Deconsolidation of Dabhol if Enron's shares are increased to 65%

To All -

Attached is the memo documenting our conclusion on the continued deconsolidation of Dabhol if Dabhol Power Company were to issue the Phase II shares that the investors are currently entitled to.  Such an issuance would increase Enron's interest in the company to approximately 65%.  In short, as long as Enron waives its majority consent abilities in a legally binding side letter with GE and Bechtel, we would not have to consolidate Dabhol.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to respond.  Thanks.

I also want to ask you some questions regarding the segregation of existing, Gallup, and Red Rock.   Do you have any time tomorrow to sit down and walk through the numbers?

I thought that I would give you a heads-up that a Unanimous Consent is being circulated for your signature. Northern Plains and NBP Services Corp are the sponsors of the Northern Border Phantom Unit Plan. We have been working with the benefits group and Pat Mackin and have now prepared an Amended and Restated Northern Border Phantom Unit Plan. The Consent authorizes the adoption and execution of that Plan. I have initialed the Consent for your execution. Should you need any further explanation, please let me know. Thanks.  Janet

Subject:	November Operational Storage Purchases

Stan,

In October we had a plan to purchase 0.5 Bcf of gas that was projected to bring our operational storage level to 12 Bcf by the end of the month and were concerned about over-filling our storage fields from potential long gas by shippers.  In reality, prices have risen and shippers have shorted the system by 1.7 Bcf month-to-date.  Our original plan, based on a combination of physical requirements and regulatory strategy was as follows:

Ending October Balance		12 Bcf
Ending November Balance		13 Bcf
Ending December Balance		14 Bcf

To acheive this plan we are projecting a purchase in November of at least 2.5 Bcf (depending upon shipper short gas over the remainder of the month).  We also expect to receive 0.3 Bcf of SBA imbalance payback in November that should raise the operational storage levels to approximately 13 Bcf.  We are still at risk for over-filling our storage fields in November and do not wish to buy any volumes that might push us over the 13 Bcf operational storage level.  Therefore, we are targeting the purchase of 2.5 Bcf of gas (which may be adjusted based on the customer's imbalances over the next week) for November.

Kent

no in fact we are increasing our short term lines of credit until the Enron situation is cleared in the market.  We had planned on a $250 million bond deal in October after the market had absorbed the news about the PGE acquisition but then Enron stock cratered and the bankers told us their was no economic deal that could be done. So we are waiting for things to clear up a bit and hopefully get into the market before year end.  We requested the additional short term lines in case this problem continues through next year which it may.  Call me if you would like further info.  Stan is already aware of this situation.

i don't think a detailed cash flow request is relevant. with respect to my simple yes...ene and dyn have investment grade credit ratings, positive cash flows, and indirect backing by chevron and and as such have tapped liquidity to the tune of $billion. As such they have the ability.  parent dividend policy normally extinguishes intercompany notes, and that is why we have agreed to classify the amount as a contra equity, but the subscription agreement states that nng can not declare dividends that cause the intercompany note to fall below 240mm...i interpret that to mean that be that nng will have a long term intercompany note of 240... and perhaps its reasonable to reflect it a such on the balance sheet.

pehaps you could ck w your peers on the dynegy account and see if they agree with classifying the 240 has negative equity. if your peers agree with your classification of the 240 then i believe i have sufficient support to tell my dynegy peer the same

A simple ""yes"" is not sufficient evidence.  I think this will be a very big
task, so you may want to put Enron Corp. Treasury on notice.  I want to see
where the money will come from that is not needed in other areas of Enron
to satisfy obligations of Enron as a whole.  This cannot include money from
NNG and TW operations, debt transactions, and Dynegy money sent to NNG.  If
this is the exercise, it may take more than 24 hours for treasury to
prepare and us to audit.

Bob gave me the subscription agreement this morning.

Our one question still remains - does Enron have the ability to pay
this?
In order to remain as an asset rather than contra-equity, can you
demonstrate that Enron has sufficient funds (other than NNG and TW
operations, debt transactions, and Dynegy money sent to NNG) to repay
the
$240 million to NNG if NNG were to call upon it.  If Enron doesn't, then
the $240 should be as a contra-equity account for GAAP purposes whether
or
not you have a subscription agreement.

Let me know when you have a minute.

Thanks,
Heather

Is this somewhere in the merger agreement that we could see?  I think
the
issue for classifying it as equity is where would the funds come from.
I
know this is something Roger and Rod discussed.  Is there some other
source
of funds (other than NNG and TW operations, debt transactions, and
Dynegy
money) that we can point to as a source of funds that could be
distributed
to NNG if NNG called on it from Corp.?

Arnold,

I'm in Bolivia this week, returning to Houston over the weekend and then going on to Miami for meetings with GTB's lenders, Exim and CAF.  I will bring the information you requested back with me and give it you when I get back into the office the week after Thanksgiving.  In summary, GTB is in good shape....we raised $10MM more in bridge loans than we planned and are making good progress with our Exim and CAF financing.  The lenders have completed their due diligence and we are meeting next week to finalize term sheets before the lenders go to their respective boards for credit approval.  

Just curious...is this request in accordance with your regularly scheduled review process or something more?  GTB's financial condition if anything has improved since the EPC contract was signed...wish we could say the same for Enron.

I have the following comments:
Credit Data
I believe the write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Paul on this memo to confirm.

Financial Trading Risk Data
We provide aggregate position data for ETS not aggregate VAR, e.g.  ETS is long 10 MMCFD natural gas at Ventura for January 2002, etc. vs. ETS has $1.5 million total VAR.  This is necessary for two reasons: 1.) Enron's VAR does not necessarily equal the sum of its subsidiaries VAR since there may be offsetting positions  throughout the business units.  2.)  Our trading books software (Caminus) does not have the capability to compute VAR in accordance with the specific methodology required (Monte Carlo simulation) in the Enron policy.

Project Analysis Data
I think this write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Lisa and Cheryl to confirm.

I believe all the WaterDesk folks are gone. I would suggest getting in touch with someone within EGS group. I recall the WaterDesk folks believing they would not pay Ariba for this as their marketplace has shut down. I don't know if contractually they have this right. Maybe Mike Sullivan can help.

Greg:

I do not have any access to information regarding PGE retained earnings. 

As we discussed this morning, distributions of cash in the form of dividends will be subject to a tax of approximately 7%.  This tax can be avoided completely if the distributions of cash take the form of intercompany loans which are settled at the close of the sale of PGE. Significant tax research and intercompany briefings took place on this very topic in July and August of this year.  The procedures for settlement of the loans are already baked into the PGE purchase and sale agreement. It is my understanding that some loans of cash have already been made under this procedure, but I am the wrong person to talk to about PGE issues or that sort.  Rod Hayslett would have more information. 
 
Jim Ginty is the appropriate tax department contact for PGE Purchase and Sale Agreement issues.

Alicia Goodrow

I had heard something similar.  We should probably get alicia to quantify exactly how much the leakage would be {in dollars} and how the mechanics would work.  Please tell alicia that we understand that this would be a whalley, mcmahon, causey decision.  We are only trying to identify options and quantify breakage and leakage.

Thanks very much for the update keep me posted.

Unlike your regulatory liabilities in the past - ""subject to refund"" - in
which there is an order from the FERC stating you can increase rates but
you need to reserve for them because they are subject to refund until the
final order comes out, this is a GAAP contingency and must meet the
definition of ""probable"" liability.  Does mangement really believe that it
is probable they will not be able to recover the $10 million?  Especially
given the 10/24/01 initial decision, do you really believe it is not
recoverable given the fact you've publicly stated that you are entitled to
it, the paying parties have stated you are entitled to it and now the ALJ
has stated that you are entitled to it?

Will management represent to us that it is probable TW will not be able to
recover in the general rep?

I'm not sure this qualifies as a subsequent event because it isn't
conclusive enough to trigger a reserve reversal. I think we should disclose
it in the interests of full disclosure, but certainly doesn't require a
change in financials.

     Subject:  RE: Initial Decision of ALJ in TW Negotiated Rates
             Proceeding


     I very much agree with the below and the reason for establishing the
     reserve, however, given the positive order from the ALJ is this a type
     I or
     type II subsequent event (one requires adjustment to the financial
     statements and one that does not).  I realize the FERC still needs to
     approve, however I think that the ""heat"" as described below has cooled
     down
     and a recommendation from the ALJ to the FERC would be viewed as a
     positive
     thing causing the need to reverse the reserve.  (see below literature
     from
     SAS 12).



     .02 Two types of subsequent events require consideration by management
     and
     evaluation by the independent auditor.

     .03 The first type consists of those events that provide additional
     evidence with respect to conditions that existed at the date of the
     balance
     sheet and affect the estimates inherent in the process of preparing
     financial statements. All information that becomes available prior to
     the
     issuance of the financial statements should be used by management in
     its
     evaluation of the conditions on which the estimates were based. The
     financial statements should be adjusted for any changes in estimates
     resulting from the use of such evidence.

     .04 Identifying events that require adjustment of the financial
     statements
     under the criteria stated above calls for the exercise of judgment and
     knowledge of the facts and circumstances. For example, a loss on an
     uncollectible trade account receivable as a result of a customer's
     deteriorating financial condition leading to bankruptcy subsequent to
     the
     balance-sheet date would be indicative of conditions existing at the
     balance-sheet date, thereby calling for adjustment of the financial
     statements before their issuance. On the other hand, a similar loss
     resulting from a customer's major casualty such as a fire or flood
     subsequent to the balance-sheet date would not be indicative of
     conditions
     existing at the balance-sheet date and adjustment of the financial
     statements would not be appropriate. The settlement of litigation for
     an
     amount different from the liability recorded in the accounts would
     require
     adjustment of the financial statements if the events, such as personal
     injury or patent infringement, that gave rise to the litigation had
     taken
     place prior to the balance-sheet date.

     .05 The second type consists of those events that provide evidence
     with
     respect to conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance
     sheet
     being reported on but arose subsequent to that date. These events
     should
     not result in adjustment of the financial statements.(superscript: 1)
     Some
     of these events, however, may be of such a nature that disclosure of
     them
     is required to keep the financial statements from being misleading.
     Occasionally such an event may be so significant that disclosure can
     best
     be made by supplementing the historical financial statements with pro
     forma
     financial data giving effect to the event as if it had occurred on the
     date
     of the balance sheet. It may be desirable to present pro forma
     statements,
     usually a balance sheet only, in columnar form on the face of the
     historical statements.

          (superscript: 1.)This paragraph is not intended to preclude
     giving
          effect in the balance sheet, with appropriate disclosure, to
     stock
          dividends or stock splits or reverse splits consummated after the
          balance-sheet date but before issuance of the financial
     statements.

     .06 Examples of events of the second type that require disclosure to
     the
     financial statements (but should not result in adjustment) are:

        a.      Sale of a bond or capital stock issue.

        b.      Purchase of a business.

        c.      Settlement of litigation when the event giving rise to the
     claim
          took place subsequent to the balance-sheet date.

        d.      Loss of plant or inventories as a result of fire or flood.

        e.      Losses on receivables resulting from conditions (such as a
          customer's major casualty) arising subsequent to the
     balance-sheet
          date.

     .07 Subsequent events affecting the realization of assets such as
     receivables and inventories or the settlement of estimated liabilities
     ordinarily will require adjustment of the financial statements (see
     paragraph .03 (Document link: P/AU560.03/AUPROSTD)) because such
     events
     typically represent the culmination of conditions that existed over a
     relatively long period of time. Subsequent events such as changes in
     the
     quoted market prices of securities ordinarily should not result in
     adjustment of the financial statements (see paragraph .05 (Document
     link:
     P/AU560.05/AUPROSTD)) because such changes typically reflect a
     concurrent
     evaluation of new conditions.

     At the time the reserve (early '01) was eatablished, the CA situation
     was much much much more contentious, and likely recovery of amounts
     negotiated was -at that time- in jeopardy. Over the course of the year
     via much time and effort (legal, regulatory, commercial), and to a
     certain degree -stablization of the CA market, customers, and the FERC
     ALJ have seen their way clear to a reasonable position.

     liability.  In fact, this document seems more to weigh against your
     need
     to
     establish a liability.  Did I miss something?

Enron Property Services may need us to move Accounting from the 9th to the 8th floor - this is due to the relocation of personnel from 21&22 to 9&10.  They are to get back to me today or early next week with more details.  Do we know already or would it be possible to expedite the answer to Accounting's long term home from an organizational standpoint?  Depending on the answer maybe it would be possible to move them to their 'final' home now (if it is outside of EEOS) instead of moving them twice.

We need your help ASAP.  ENBT Delaware and Potomac Capital are shown in Secretariat as being owners of preferred stock in Organizational Partner, Inc. a wholly owned sub of Enron.  Mike Moran had previously advised us that these entities were third parties and that they had 25% of the voting interest in Organizational Partner, Inc.  After sifting through the layers of subs between NNG/TW and Enron Corp. we calculated that if we ascribe 25% ""ownership"" in Organizational partner to third parties, then Enron owns 99.5% of NNG and TW.  On this foundation Mike Moran had advised us to refer to NNG and TW as majority-owned subs of Enron in our GAAP financial statements (notes) and FERC Form 2 filings.

As per the note below, Andersen is trying to verify that the two preferred stock owners are indeed third parties, and not subs of Enron.  Can you have some appropriate individual confirm this for us.  Heather needs the info for Andersen's review letter associated with the Revolvers.

Bob Chandler said you were looking into the ownership structure questions.
If ENBT Delaware and Potomac Capital are truly third parties and not Enron
entities, I just want to make sure Enron does not control these entities,
because if Enron does, then we should probably say ""wholly"" owned in our
opinion rather than ""majority"" owned.

The following representations (among others) have been made to various parties relative to both the credit agreement (with the banks) and the Preferred Stock Agreeement (Dynegy) to the Boards of Transwestern (TW), Northern (NNG) and Enron Transportation Services (ETSC) and it subsidiaries, as well as to Dynegy and the banks:

The funds that are being loaned out of NNG and TW to various entities and the further loans of these funds to Enron will carry Enron Corp guaranties.
The note agreements will reimburse NNG, TW and ETSC and their subsidiaries for their actual expenses associated with these endeavors.
The credit agreements actually require a large degree of separateness and an arm's length standard needs to be applied to dealings between ETSC and its subsidiaries and Enron and the rest of it's subsidiaries.

Before the funding under the credit agreement takes place I would like to make sure that you two are aware of this, have agreed to and understand the conditions and further agree that you will assist me in cleaning up whatever documentation needs to be cleaned up between Enron and ETSC and it's subs to make the above representations not be false.

Fair Value is applied to plant and is being amortized over a useful life.
TW Fair Value is very similar to Goodwill in that it represents an excess over historical book value, and is not formally being recoverd in rates; BUT at the time of the  acquistion it was treated as a purchase price allocation an applied to plant. Goodwill is meant to be a ""leftover"" after all costs have been allocated.

Importance:	High

Rod,

The primary change to the Plan is to add the ability to grant Phantom LP Units. Right now the Phantom Units under the Plan are valued based upon a general partner distribution rate divided by the distribution yield, which depending upon what assumptions are used, makes these phantom units quite expensive. It was decided that the grants should be based upon the Common Unit price and not the general partner valuation. I am not sure of the breakdown of employees per NP and NBP that have elected to defer bonuses into this Plan to date. Benefits have asked that we have the changes put into place by Friday in order to incorporate them into the year-end deferral package offered to employees. If you need financial projections, I will have Jerry provide those. Hope this addresses your concerns.  If not, I will be happy to provide more.  Janet

Drew and Rod,
I thought that I would give you a heads-up that a Unanimous Consent is being circulated for your signature. Northern Plains and NBP Services Corp are the sponsors of the Northern Border Phantom Unit Plan. We have been working with the benefits group and Pat Mackin and have now prepared an Amended and Restated Northern Border Phantom Unit Plan. The Consent authorizes the adoption and execution of that Plan. I have initialed the Consent for your execution. Should you need any further explanation, please let me know. Thanks.  Janet

Rod:

As per our phone conversation, the list of information we would like to
have follows:

1.  FERC Form 2s for the last three years
2.  Revenue breakdown:
   Assumptions made for the contracted period, as well as the time period
   beyond current contracts - firm/interruptible mix and volumes, tariffs
   for each type of transportation contract
   A build up from contracts to the revenues in the model would be ideal
3.  As before, compressor gas volumes and assumed sales prices for the
projected years
4.  As before, the story as it relates to CERA's view of the world
5.  Explicit calculation of rate base going forward
6.  Employee benefit plan information - funding status, return rates,
future liabilities

Thanks Rod.

Active Physical Positions	38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	345.0 	
VaR ($thousands)	159.4 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	0	
		


Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

We are planning on your placing separate coverage by 12-31-01.  You have not been allocated any property premium for the period 1-1-02 to 3-31-02.  If you wish to remain in the Enron program for the period 1-01-02 to 3-31-02, we will allocate premium to EOTT and you should budget accordingly.  

For the Enron Property package renewal 04-01-02, we are not including EOTT assets which also means that,  the MTBE plant is also, not included.  If you decide to postpone marketing a separate program for EOTT,  we need to know as soon as possible in order to adjust our market plan.

Jim I can pull this together for you next week maybe...but I may need to fly to NYC.  I can readily send you premium dollars but unfortunately they also include what I pay you and therefore I would need to break out these costs so you don't double count them.  BUt maybe you can work with the spread sheet and get enough to get you what you need.  Please bear in mind I have not looked at this report closely ...so you are getting it ""as is""

We are trying to compile the total cost of risk or total insurance spend for all of Enron.  You participate in some of our programs and you are spending premium dollars in the market and therefore would be part of the ""big picture"".   For EOTT, an accurate report would include, in addition to actual premiums, the amounts spent, or Eott's out of pocket expense, within the deductibles

I thought this would be something that you would have readily available and could be provided on short notice.  

Please send to Paul's attention.  I am available if you wish to discuss.

We are attempting to determine the total cost of risk for Enron which necessitates gathering information from the Enron entities that place their own insurance. We need to have information broken down on your individual programs as well as for project specific programs which you place. We would like a complete schedule to include the following:

?	type of coverage,
?	limits,
?	deductibles / retentions,
?	premiums.

We assume that you have this information and can forward in short order. Unfortunately due to the short timeline, please forward no later than Wednesday, October 24.

As we have discussed, this is a memo I plan to issue today that will create a vacancy in my organization (Director, Financial Planning).  Since this position is located in Omaha, I would like to immediately post internally and externally; however, I will do everything I can to use an internal candidate.  FYI, I believe Rod is on board with this.  I'll try to e-mail the job description to you today.  Let me know if you have questions.

The following is a message I would like to send out tomorrow to all NPNG and NBP Services employees, and ETS Finance and Accounting Directors and above.  Please work with system to make the distribution happen.  But, do not release until I give the go ahead!


Northern Border Partners Financial Planning Organization

Timely and accurate financial forecasting is critical to Northern Border Partners in light of recent acquisition activity and continued focus by our investment analysts on earnings and cash flow guidance for the partnership.  The following organizational changes are being implemented to improve communication and coordination in our financial planning process. 

All financial planning functions for the Northern Border Partners entities will be centralized in my group under a new position, Director, Financial Planning, reporting to me.  Reporting to the Director, Financial Planning will be Phil Boggs,  Jay Nigh, Andy Schroeder and Cheryl Perchal.  Phil, and Jay will provide financial planning support to the Omaha based commercial functions for Northern Border Pipeline, Midwestern, Border Midstream and Black Mesa.  Commercial support for these companies, i.e. deal and business development analysis, will continue to be the responsibility of Gaye Lynn Schaffart.  Andy will be responsible for financial planning activities for Crestone/Bear Paw in Denver.  Andy will also oversee Crestone's equity investments and will continue to report to Don Baldridge with respect to those activities.  Cheryl, as Manager, ETS Risk Management, will be responsible for monitoring trading risk management activities and performing/coordinating RAC analysis on capital projects for ETS and Northern Border.

FYI.    This is my story for now, but I think it explains the volumes and the rates as well as the revenue projections.   Please note we have found a bust in 2002 revenue.   This yields a higher answer without any additional volumes being used.

If it would help to have move time to interview and find the right person for the EGS CIO position, I would be willing to run the organization as Steve tries to leave for his new position.  I do not have an interest in the position but know I am capable of handling the job on a temporary basis if it would help.   I do not want us to rush just to fill the position if you and Stan do not have a strong feeling for any of the current candidates.

Rod, Tom, 
Roger's question/concern is serious, and the approach I've seen in documentation
does not help our position

We are proposing (or are) to argue that Fair Value is substantially less than $41.9mm.
If that is the case, we will have to go back and impair the MTBE facility, and re-do the
financials. We have asserted that the fair value for book purposes approximates a higher value than our tac position. Normally this variance is no big deal, but because of the ""sale"", this book tax variation is problematic. This will result in a substantial loss, and cause EOTT's SEC filings to be in jeopardy.

Frequency or incident rates are calculated as follows:

Lost Time = no. of incidents x 200,000/total no. man hours worked

Recordable= same as above.  There are individual recordable cases and ALL lost time incidents are counted as ""one"" lost time and ""one"" recordable.  In other words every LT adds one to LT and one to Recordables.

Vehicle Frequency= no. of accidents x 1,000,000/total miles driven.

Greg:

I do not have any access to information regarding PGE retained earnings. 

As we discussed this morning, distributions of cash in the form of dividends will be subject to a tax of approximately 7%.  This tax can be avoided completely if the distributions of cash take the form of intercompany loans which are settled at the close of the sale of PGE. Significant tax research and intercompany briefings took place on this very topic in July and August of this year.  The procedures for settlement of the loans are already baked into the PGE purchase and sale agreement. It is my understanding that some loans of cash have already been made under this procedure, but I am the wrong person to talk to about PGE issues or that sort.  Rod Hayslett would have more information. 
 
Jim Ginty is the appropriate tax department contact for PGE Purchase and Sale Agreement issues.

Please tell alicia that we understand that this would be a whalley, mcmahon, causey decision.  We are only trying to identify options and quantify breakage and leakage.

Rod,

I spoke to Jack Insinga of Standard Chartered yesterday. He specifically needs to speak to someone with Enron who can address the EOTT situation from Enron's perspective.  I told hiim I thought you were the best person for this discussion. We are having a bank meeting next Friday a.m. , November 9th and perhaps sometime prior to that would be a good time to meet.

All of the banks are looking for more information before they will do anything for us so realistically I am not optimistic that BNP Paribas will change their credit view at this time.  Hopefully after the banks have had time to digest the bank meeting information, credit committees will calm down a bit.

Thanks, Kelly

Rod I do not have Kelly Boots e-mail address and am traveling today without a phone directory... but I wanted to share or at least ask that we treat Standard Chartered real nice as we go through this crisis.  These guys are stepping up for us in every way....they (along with ING) are 100% behind us and are putting their money on it.  Also BNP Pays Bas is having an awful time with their credit committee...the business people have approved this and do not feel that Enron's problem effects us but the credit committee is not so forgiving.  If Kelly or anyone can do anything to help Paysbas in this situation it would be greatly appreciated.   My account executive there is Lincoln Payton and Marci Weiss...

Would you be so kind as to pass this along to Kelly or anyone else that you feel appropriate?

Rod:

I think it may eventually be appropriate, but I would prefer not to do it right away.  My team has had a bad experience with Global Finance over the years.  They have always had an arrogant attitude and often did deals involving our assets without consulting or even involving the commercial team responsible for the asset.  Kevin is going to need to overcome this and demonstrate that he is coming in to behave differently.  It is very important to me to have a centralized analytical team so that I know there is consistency, independence and thoroughness in the analytics related to the EGAS businesses.  I have learned the hard way that analytical groups under the control of a commercial team sometimes produce lower quality results. I also like to have a single point of contact for other parts of the Enron organization that want or need models, valuations and analytics.  Again, historically I have seen disastrous results when there are multiple sources of information relating to any given project.

I do think it makes sense to describe Louie Fischer's relationship to Kevin as a dotted line and then we can reevaluate over time.  I would also suggest that prior to or immediately following an announcement you have Kevin go meet with each manager of a significant business (namely Pete and Mariella) to introduce himself and describe how he is going to fit into the organization.  I also think he needs to make that introduction interactive and do some listening not just talking.  He will ultimately find them more cooperative and trusting if he makes an effort to assure them that he is part of the team and not just a finance guy trying to get his name on a deal and earn a big bonus.

I am getting ready to announce that I am bringing Kevin Howard into EGS as Vice President of Finance and Transaction Support.    Thinking about the current organization, do think it appropriate to consider putting Ms Fischer in his organization?   The kind of things she is doing for you currently are similar to the kind of things we are going to have Kevin working with Corp on.   I will be putting into his organization the economic analytic talents and special projects people from the pipeline group as well as some others.    We will not be charging out these costs into the specific commercial units, but instead expect them to generate the ideas and value to pay for themselves.    His group will be providing services to all, but I am willing to carve out some priorities.

When I was in Calgary, Keith Petersen and I were talking about rates and certificates and he mentioned some seminars that the Omaha people do.  Additionally, we discussed some sites that would provide a variety of things to see.  Below is a possible schedule he sent me. 

What we would provide is a Certificates 101 training and answer questions (1 1/2 Hours), Steve Kirk's group would provide a rates and tariff 101 session that would take a full 2 hours or maybe more, and Tim Kissner would provide a cost of service presentation (how he arrives at a cost of service).  Tim's presentation takes another 1 1/2 hours.  This would take up one day.  Then I could provide the names or help you set up tours of the Redfield Underground storage, a tour of the Ogden compressor station, A tour of the Garner LNG, and possibly a tour of the Farmington Compressor station.  The Ogden station does not have turbine horsepower or electric driven units, but is a major compressor station on our system.  This would take most of two days to cover.  

I mentioned this idea to Eric and Steve and they are both very interested.  Also, Tony Pryor was there and he said Drew would be interested, and I got an e-mail from Nancy Bagot in the DC office wanting to participate.  I realize this could become a lot of people, but it could be a good opportunity for some practical experience and team building.  What do you think?

Subject:	Karen Choyce

I will give you some comments on the Service Agreement (from Mary Perkins) on Monday.

I talked with Karen Choyce:

Some wire are paid by Ipayit.  But I think we all agreed that there are adequate controls in Ipayit already.

Karen's group handles other wires, many of the high value wires.  Maggie's interest and principal payment wires are probably paid by Karen's group.  Karen has three people who process the wires, none of which are dedicated to any particular Enron company.  They each process wires across all of Enron's entities.  The volume of Citrus/FGT's wires are not enough to justify one person's time.

In the Enron Policies, Approval Authorizations for Cash Disbursements on the Web, there is a Policy and list of authorized approvers.  There is a signature on file for each of these persons.  When Karen's people get a wire request form (and they are all on paper with orignial signatures, nothing electronic) they follow the Policy and note the appropriate signature applies.  They will check a signature to the approved signature on file if necessary.  Karen Choyce has the authority to change coding but not approval for payment.  I would guess there are enough coding errors that she needs that power.  Karen's people then input into SAP from which Mary Perkins' group makes the payments.

I did notice that Mike Moran and Rock Meyer are still on the Website Approval list.  You might want to consider adding Maggie to the above $1.0 MM approval list.

I mentioned to her the idea that we might institute a second level of approvals for wires but not the idea that we might take this function over in Citrus/FGT ourselves.

Recommendation:  Since this does not appear to be a full-time job to process Citrus/FGT wires, we could save some Corporate Charge dollars and find someone in Citrus/FGT who might be underutilized to do this function.

I was afraid of that.  However, our cost center would only incur the costs for four people.  Would we have the funds for that?  I assume each cost center, i.e. legal, DC and commercial, would cover their own costs.  I am not sure what the overall costs would be, but I can do a budget if you want.

When I was in Calgary, Keith Petersen and I were talking about rates and certificates and he mentioned some seminars that the Omaha people do.  Additionally, we discussed some sites that would provide a variety of things to see.  Below is a possible schedule he sent me. 

What we would provide is a Certificates 101 training and answer questions (1 1/2 Hours), Steve Kirk's group would provide a rates and tariff 101 session that would take a full 2 hours or maybe more, and Tim Kissner would provide a cost of service presentation (how he arrives at a cost of service).  Tim's presentation takes another 1 1/2 hours.  This would take up one day.  Then I could provide the names or help you set up tours of the Redfield Underground storage, a tour of the Ogden compressor station, A tour of the Garner LNG, and possibly a tour of the Farmington Compressor station.  The Ogden station does not have turbine horsepower or electric driven units, but is a major compressor station on our system.  This would take most of two days to cover.  

I mentioned this idea to Eric and Steve and they are both very interested.  Also, Tony Pryor was there and he said Drew would be interested, and I got an e-mail from Nancy Bagot in the DC office wanting to participate.  I realize this could become a lot of people, but it could be a good opportunity for some practical experience and team building.  What do you think?

Cheers,

Michael

Here's a little more detail on the voice mail I left you earlier.  The banks want more than just secured debt.  They want a mortgage on all of TW and NNG's real property.  That's right, they want a filing with every county courthouse where NNG and TW own assets.  I want to talk to you tomorrow before Stan's meeting about why that is just a terrible idea.  In short, at the same time we are doing this big loan and cash infusion into ENA to ""calm the market"" we will simultaneously have dozens of right of way guys and local real estate lawyers crawling all over the place doing something I don't think any pipeline has done before (at least not in my memory).  Nevertheless, I want to be able to move forward if there is no alternative.  For us to prepare mortgage documents we need (I think) to have approximate property values by county.  Do we have this info somewhere?  Are ad valorem tax values kept by county?  I don't think our FERC books will be much help on this.  Lou is getting Johnny McGee and some folks together after Stan's meeting to talk to me and the Vinson and Elkins folks about how we can do this project if we have to.  It will be a challenge, particularly in the 2 week timetable they are talking about.       Talk to you tomorrow.  DF

Rod,

We need to make sure Enron Treasury understands the $300 million plus of NEPCO cash will have to flow back in the next year.  I have been involved in two situations where some smart people in the treasury functions did not really understand this impact. There is more cash to come from the projects, but for the most part that represents the profits and that cash will not really be ours until we have cleared the retainages and LOC's. If we can get a couple of new projects in NEPCO, we might be able to sustain the balance, but nothing is secure at this time.

Rod - What is our policy of accepting direct charges for corporate assistance?   Should this remain in corporate and be a part of the allocation?

Mike - Was any agreement made up front with Brindle to cover Kyle's expenses?   Was the request to travel made by Dave Odneal or yourself?

Subject:	FW: Notes from Enron
Importance:	High


The following representations (among others) have been made to various parties in due diligence relative to both the credit agreement (with the banks) and the Preferred Stock Agreement (Dynegy) to the Boards of Transwestern (TW), Northern (NNG) and Enron Transportation Services (ETSC) and it subsidiaries, as well as to Dynegy and the banks:

The funds that are being loaned out of NNG and TW to various entities and the further loans of these funds to Enron will carry Enron Corp guaranties.
The note agreements will reimburse NNG, TW and ETSC and their subsidiaries for their actual expenses associated with these endeavors.
The credit agreements actually require a large degree of separateness and an arm's length standard needs to be applied to dealings between ETSC and its subsidiaries and Enron and the rest of it's subsidiaries.

Before the funding under the credit agreement takes place I would like to make sure that you two are aware of this, have agreed to and understand the conditions and further agree that you will assist me in cleaning up whatever documentation needs to be cleaned up between Enron and ETSC and it's subs to make the above representations not be false.

Paul,

I need two new bank accounts set up, one for Transwestern Pipeline Company and one for Northern Natural Gas Company. Per the Credit Agreements related to the $1 billion Pipeline Financing, Citibank and JP Morgan Chase have require us to set aside $10,000,000 in a Transwestern account and $30,000,000 in Northern Natural account.  These amounts cannot ZBA up to Enron Corp.  The banks require us to set aside these amounts (equal to one month of operating expenses) and have them available in accounts that are not swept to Enron Corp.

Let me know if I need to provide you with any further information.

Thanks,
Travis

The original send-out went to everyone.  Long ago and far away, since engineering took so long to do the Level B's.  We reviewed briefly at one of the Commercial meetings when you were absent.  I made changes to the CB assumptions as a result of suggestions by Cheryl.  I made changes to the straight-up and also the CB model as result of suggestions by you regarding doing the books more precisely.  
 
The results of this were rerouted. Also long ago.
 
Finally, late week before last, received the Bs.

The attached includes the standard economic analsyses for Phase VI. 

<<Synopsis Phase 62.xls>> 

The pertinent worksheets are: Capital, Economics on Total Capital, and Detailed Leveraged Books Grossed Up.  The last item includes the working capital impact.  For consistency with prior analyses, the total capital economics do not.  

One other twist:  Rather than use the equity AFUDC as non- cash, I recalculated the ""AFUDC"" using real life short term interest to come up with a more realistic estimate of the total cash requirements.

FYI, there are a couple of other worksheets in the workbook.  Among them is one for the the leveraged books on a non-grossed up basis.  I did this primarily to make sure that there were no busts, since the results must come out the same whether or not you gross up.

	I am dropping you this e-mail at the request of Rod Hayslett and in response to your voice mail message to him concerning the status of the price redetermination under the LNG contract with Duke.  The parties reached settlement on this issue about a week before arbitration.  The new price beginning September 1 is 92.5% of the Equivalent MMBtu Price of No. 6 Fuel Oil less $0.25 per
MMBtu.  Of course, the other provisions of the contract,  such as the ceiling price, the floor price and the bank provisions,  remain.

	I trust that makes some semblance of sense.  If you have additional questions, please call.

We expect to hear something on tues in regard to the extension of 2 weeks but will probably not know about the final fix until the 2nd week of dec

Why would we not sell the units even if the proceeds are trapped in rawhide as it would allow us to pay down debt ?

Please find attached file. Transportation & Storage Revenue is right off the Earning Model Income Statement. Carlton data can be found in the Commercial Function detail within the ""Database"" worksheet of the Earning Model. The Cash Flow verbiage is very general related to the subject matter, but does provide a business reason on a Direct Cash Flow basis for an item buried within the Indirect Cash Flow format.

As part of Ken Lays initiative to measure Enron's social and environmental risk, EAS has been requested to help with a baseline assessment of what our BU's are doing in those areas.  As such, please talk with your CAO's and/or BU leaders as part of your 2002 risk assessment and obtain answers to the following questions and send them back to me on or before Thanksgiving.  Please let me know if you're having any problems with this or need further clarification.


* Do the business units know the scope and nature of social and environmental risks associated with their business strategy, transactions, assets, countries where they operate, and/or counter parties? 
* Do the business units have a process to identify social and environmental risk?
* If so, what process does the business units employ in order to identify and manage social and environmental risk?
* What process do the business units use to quantify and/or qualify these exposures?
* Who is responsible for managing this process in the business?  
* Does the business review the quality of their social/environmental risk assessment and management activities?
* Is the business unit aware of the existing corporate function and processes?

This information will help Ken and his task team to  develop a proposed process for developing a consistent process for measuring social/environmental risk management performance across the business.  We may be asked for more assistance in this area in 2002.

Thank you for your assistance!

Shawn

I understand we have agreed and the documentation could be done as early as today.   Bill Bradford is working on this one.   So it's up to Enron to fix the problem at this point in time.

Just wanted to see if these LC's were absolutely necessary at this time.  We just got another request today for two more LC's.  The total of all four LC's is now $11.98MM and all cash requests are now going through Bill Bradford to see which gets paid.

Is there any update on your negotiations with Standard Chartered?

"FW: Notes from Enron","
The following representations (among others) have been made to various parties in due diligence relative to both the credit agreement (with the banks) and the Preferred Stock Agreement (Dynegy) to the Boards of Transwestern (TW), Northern (NNG) and Enron Transportation Services (ETSC) and it subsidiaries, as well as to Dynegy and the banks:

The funds that are being loaned out of NNG and TW to various entities and the further loans of these funds to Enron will carry Enron Corp guaranties.
The note agreements will reimburse NNG, TW and ETSC and their subsidiaries for their actual expenses associated with these endeavors.
The credit agreements actually require a large degree of separateness and an arm's length standard needs to be applied to dealings between ETSC and its subsidiaries and Enron and the rest of it's subsidiaries.

Before the funding under the credit agreement takes place I would like to make sure that you two are aware of this, have agreed to and understand the conditions and further agree that you will assist me in cleaning up whatever documentation needs to be cleaned up between Enron and ETSC and it's subs to make the above representations not be false.

I wonder if the person you spoke with is aware of the previous arrangements.  Do you get the funny feeling they are trying to distance themselves from us ???  Here is the excerpt from the original Enron invitation.  I have been attending these since the early nineties, and Enron has always been discounted 50%.  Even the full price they quoted you contradicts the October 12th memo that quotes a full price of $950:

Once again, due to the level of Enron 's attendance, we have arranged to
facilitate you or your group's registration.  If you would like to register
or would like more information, please contact Sabrina Whaley at 646-6340
by November 5, 2001.  A copy of the Symposium agenda has been attached for
your review.  The registration fee is $950 per person; however we offer all
Enron personnel wanting to attend a 50% discount.  All billing arrangements
will be made through Bob Butts.

For $1,200, I will cancel my reservations.

Thanks for checking.

How's this?

Recently we've had a couple of mix ups regarding vacant office space and phone moves. In light of this, we'd like to help by coordinating the moves in 3AC like we've been doing in the Enron Building. We know you are all very busy, and we'll be happy to submit move requests for you, including telephone moves and reassignments.

This will also enable us to keep current on floor space billing and make sure it gets corrected when an employee moves.

Please contact Ruthann (x66538) for assistance with any moves in 3AC, and Pam (x36135) for assistance with any moves in the Enron Building. Of course, if one of us is unavailable, feel free to call the other. If an office or cubicle is vacant and you would like to put someone in it, please contact us, so we can help coordinate it and hopefully avoid confusion.

Thanks for your help.

Maybe overkill, I would rather send them an email talking about the problems, and they have to let you 2 know when they going to use a space, and how they can coordinate stuff with you 2 instead of dictating.

That sounds good. We might also want to include any other request that would potentially use a ""space"" such as tables for data rooms, contractors, etc. If they think it only applies if they are actually moving a person or phone, the spaces we think we have available may be used without churns. For instance, sometimes I think spaces are available for use, only to find boxes and/or equipment has been set up. Just a thought. What do you think -- overkill?

In an effort to better control our space planning needs, effective immediately all ETS moves will be coordinated by Pam Daily and Ruthann Frausto. This pertains to all moves, including telephone only moves.

Please contact Pam (X36135)  regarding any moves in the Enron Building, and contact Ruthann (x66538) regarding any moves in the 3AC building. Of course, if one of us is unavailable, feel free to contact the other.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Subject:	EAMR Transactions


This memo is being forwarded to you to address issues that have developed during recent Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) transactions and to establish appropriate procedures for going forward.  EAMR, as you are probably aware, is an affiliate of Enron Transportation Services Company that performs services for third parties as well as other Enron affiliate companies. 

When EAMR enters into a contract with non Enron customers to deliver services, EAMR assumes all of the risk for any losses in the transaction  Additionally, EAMR is not to be supported financially by the affiliated pipelines.  All costs such as employee payroll expenses, travel and other related employee expenses, equipment usage fees, etc  associated with an employee performing services for a customer under an EAMR transaction must be accurately recorded pursuant to prudent accounting procedures. 

Going forward,  to ensure that there are no financial or contractual obligations that are not in the best interest of EAMR, the following process will be used on all transactions.

1) Cost estimates for services through EAMR will be sent to Sarabeth Smith in Houston for review and approval.  Sarabeth will ensure that all costs and appropriate margins are included in the cost structure and then release it through a non-binding agreement for presentation to the customer by appropriate marketing personnel.  Cost estimates, given to customers outside of this step in the process, run the possibility of having to be retracted due to the risk of committing EAMR to a transaction that is not contractually or financially sound.

2) It is the responsibility of every employee performing services for EAMR to be diligent in recording their time and expenses required to perform the services to the appropriately assigned project number.  Monthly reviews of the expenses associated with each project will be conducted to ensure that all costs have been accurately recorded.  Sarabeth will be the point of contact with the transaction originator, contract administration and legal to ensure draft agreements as well as the final agreement have been coordinated through all appropriate groups.   Legal agreements will not be issued without proper sign-off of authorization.

3) All contracts must adhere to fundamental risk parameters set forth by management.  These mandates are very clear concerning contract language and operating parameters for EAMR transactions.  Your cooperation by adhering to the processes described in this memo is critical to  the continued success of EAMR as a revenue generating entity as well as another ""marketing tool"" for the customer.  

Contact Information for EAMR will Sarabeth Smith at 713-345-5023, sarabeth.smith@enron.com, 1400 Smith 3AC-3147, Houston, TX  77002.

Please pass this memo on to team members or other members of your staff that currently work or may work on EAMR transactions. 

Thanks for your support in this endeavor.

Subject:	RE: Draft memo to admins

That sounds good. We might also want to include any other request that would potentially use a ""space"" such as tables for data rooms, contractors, etc. If they think it only applies if they are actually moving a person or phone, the spaces we think we have available may be used without churns. For instance, sometimes I think spaces are available for use, only to find boxes and/or equipment has been set up. Just a thought. What do you think -- overkill?

What do you think of this to send out to the admins in 3AC?

In an effort to better control our space planning needs, effective immediately all ETS moves will be coordinated by Pam Daily and Ruthann Frausto. This pertains to all moves, including telephone only moves.

Please contact Pam (X36135)  regarding any moves in the Enron Building, and contact Ruthann (x66538) regarding any moves in the 3AC building. Of course, if one of us is unavailable, feel free to contact the other.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Feel free to make any changes you'd like.

I have twice emailed Sally Beck, the signatory on the last agreements signed by ENA, with NNG and TW, to see if she could give me a lead on whom to contact.  I also left her a voice mail.  She has not responded.   We cannot proceed with the Northern Border implementation without a confidentiality agreement between ENA and NBP.  

Caminus is still looking to set up a meeting for gathering requirements for both NBP and possibly the Risk Analytics package.

Sally,

In March of 1999, ETS companies, Northern Natural Gas (NNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (TW), signed Confidentiality Agreements with Enron Capital and Trade (ECT) for pricing information.  You were the signatory for ECT at that time.  These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes.  Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.  However, the Confidentiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any other companies.  I would appreciate any assistance you could provide in identifying the new person at ENA/EWS that would handle these duties currently.

Thanks

Subject:	FW: Notes from Enron
Importance:	High


The following representations (among others) have been made to various parties in due diligence relative to both the credit agreement (with the banks) and the Preferred Stock Agreement (Dynegy) to the Boards of Transwestern (TW), Northern (NNG) and Enron Transportation Services (ETSC) and it subsidiaries, as well as to Dynegy and the banks:

The funds that are being loaned out of NNG and TW to various entities and the further loans of these funds to Enron will carry Enron Corp guaranties.
The note agreements will reimburse NNG, TW and ETSC and their subsidiaries for their actual expenses associated with these endeavors.
The credit agreements actually require a large degree of separateness and an arm's length standard needs to be applied to dealings between ETSC and its subsidiaries and Enron and the rest of it's subsidiaries.

Before the funding under the credit agreement takes place I would like to make sure that you two are aware of this, have agreed to and understand the conditions and further agree that you will assist me in cleaning up whatever documentation needs to be cleaned up between Enron and ETSC and it's subs to make the above representations not be false.

Joe Jeffers has hired Russell Hardie to fill the vacancy in his group. Russell is currently working in Elaine Tombaugh's IT group, here on 3AC32. He'll be taking only his telephone and personal belongings with him.

I need to get the proper approvals before submitting a churn request to move his telephone from 3AC3234 to 3AC3204. 

If you approve of this move, please forward this message along with an indication of your approval, to Rod Hayslett for his approval.

Title: The West Enters a Bust 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2810;


***********************************************************************

RADICAL SHIFT IN WESTERN MARKET DYNAMICS

The western power markets are entering a bust period as a result of the 24,000 
megawatts of power plant additions and demand decline brought on by last year's 
high prices and the current economic softness. This bust period is likely to 
last for several years. Western gas markets have also entered a bust with the 
delayed start to winter and full storage inventories exerting downward pressure 
on both North American prices and western basis differentials. Through the 
remainder of this year and into well into next, western regional gas and power 
markets will remain soft and possibly weaken further.

*  Power operating reserves should rise to above 15 percent by next summer in 
the Southwest and California, pushing power prices down and improving 
reliability.

*  Power demand is expected to shrink by 11 percent in the fourth quarter; 
market contractions will return demand in 2002 to levels experienced in 1998. 

*  Full gas storage inventories, huge declines in year-over-year demand, and 
the onset of significant pipeline capacity additions will keep a lid on West 
Coast differentials.

Subject:	A/R Securitization

Rod:

Global Finance is undertaking a corporate-wide accounts receivable securitization program. We closed a commercial paper conduit receivables securitization transaction program last quarter and are looking to close a second receivables transaction (most likely a privately placed term loan facility) by mid-November.  Towards that goal, we are investigating the receivables and payables position of all Enron entities.  We would like to enlist your team's assistance in better understanding ETS's receivables and payables position and how that data is generated and processed.

To better understand our project and data request, I have attached presentations and due diligence questions from the mandated banks' proposals to Enron.  Although all requested details are not needed immediately, what is urgent at bare minimum is net receivable balance, aging and roll forward for September and October.  We are scheduled to meet with banks tomorrow to discuss opportunities.

Any and all assistance and guidance is much appreciated.  Based on our prior experience, we understand the process of gathering and processing data may be time consuming.  However, I'd like to note that the other business unit teams assembled thus far are available to share their insights, techniques, and expertise.  We will do our best to provide you any assistance you may need in fulfilling our request. 

Please call me at your convenience to discuss the best way to proceed; my telephone number is 713-853-0920.  I look forward to working with you and your team.

Sincerely,
Michelle Wenz

Greg:

I do not have any access to information regarding PGE retained earnings.


As we discussed this morning, distributions of cash in the form of
dividends will be subject to a tax of approximately 7%.  This tax can be
avoided completely if the distributions of cash take the form of
intercompany loans which are settled at the close of the sale of PGE.
Significant tax research and intercompany briefings took place on this
very topic in July and August of this year.  The procedures for
settlement of the loans are already baked into the PGE purchase and sale
agreement. It is my understanding that some loans of cash have already
been made under this procedure, but I am the wrong person to talk to
about PGE issues or that sort.  Rod Hayslett would have more
information.=20

Subject:	Confidential - GSS Organization Value to ETS


Here are my thoughts on the value the GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) brings to ETS:

I believe totally in the concept of strategically sourcing our materials and services for ETS, which is the concept that GSS was founded under, while still within the ETS organization.  Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS.   The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are:

The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine.
Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000.
ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more.
New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's.
Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy).
GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing.
ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register.


If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals)

Two (2) negotiators - Contract Managers
Two (2) analysts
Two (2) contract administrators

The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC:

iBuyit System
Catalog system (part of iBuyit)
iPayit system

We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department.   This would take very few staff adds to make that happen.

Let me know if you need any further detail.

   Subject: Confidential - Decision tree on projects

   Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting.

   There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and
   thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama
   and Gaza.  In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have
   taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies
   and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the
   loans.  SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem.  Panama is much less
   (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be
   sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year.  Note that, in
   Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is
   non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM.  In the past, we have
   discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to
   potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama.
   The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from actions taken
   by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with private
   parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which
   although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a ""mark"" on
   the company's liquidity position.

   Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in
   Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken
   or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an
   effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor
   confidence?  The same could go for SECLP and Gaza.

   This is simply an overall ""guidance"" question.  Let's take it up during
   our staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you.

   Many thanks, Mariella

They want us to record the amounts loaned, normal loans, as a reduction of equity, if ENE does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability.  They do not want to count the 1.5B or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes.  They are specifically concerned about the current intercompany notes.

				Rod I do not have Kelly Boots e-mail address and am traveling today without a phone directory... but I wanted to share or at least ask that we treat Standard Chartered real nice as we go through this crisis.  These guys are stepping up for us in every way....they (along with ING) are 100% behind us and are putting their money on it.  Also BNP Pays Bas is having an awful time with their credit committee...the business people have approved this and do not feel that Enron's problem effects us but the credit committee is not so forgiving.  If Kelly or anyone can do anything to help Paysbas in this situation it would be greatly appreciated.   My account executive there is Lincoln Payton and Marci Weiss...

She has not responded.   We cannot proceed with the Northern Border implementation without a confidentiality agreement between ENA and NBP.

Sally,

In March of 1999, ETS companies, Northern Natural Gas (NNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (TW), signed Confidentiality Agreements with Enron Capital and Trade (ECT) for pricing information.  You were the signatory for ECT at that time.  These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes.  Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.  However, the Confidentiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any other companies.  I would appreciate any assistance you could provide in identifying the new person at ENA/EWS that would handle these duties currently.

Thanks

Subject: Consultant's view on gas transmission into California
Importance: High


Rod:

As we discussed here are the bulletts that summarize what we heard from our consultants.

Overall demand picture

Believe it will be 2006 before the California market will get back to 2000/2001 demand levels

          2002            demand down approximately 900 mmcf/d
          2003            demand will be flat
          2004            growth in demand will begin
          2005-2006   return to 2001 demand levels

Reasoning:
   2001 was a dry year - the lack of hydro generation created an additional 600 mmcf/d demand for gas in California
   Anticipated generation capacity overbuild in California - new more efficient power plants with better heat rates will displace older gas fired generation, reducing the amount of gas              required to generate a MW of electricity on the margin
   California electricity rate increases have curtailed demand for power and subsequently, gas

Gas transmission capacity into the state

Over the next two to three years there will be an additional 2.0 Bcf/d of transmission capacity into California
   800 mmcf/d in 2002
   900 mmcf/d in 2003 (Kern River expansion)
   300 mmcf/d               (El Paso conversion of All American oil line and power up)

San Juan basin gas

San Juan basin production is declining

   first half of 2001 vs. first half of 2000 production off by approximately 200 mmcf/d
   Rockies gas will not replace declining production in the San Juan San Juan gas will move closer to Permian pricing


The consultants believe that the combination of these factors will put decontracting pressure on existing transmission into the state of California, and especially the El Paso and Transwestern lines.

However, the ""wild card"" in their view is unforeseen California power demand growth.

As we discussed, JPMorgan would like to hear your views on the above issues.

Please give me a call when you have had sufficient time to digest and we can set up a conference call to make the most efficient use of your time.

Thanks Rod

Brent

Also, when you have had a chance to look at sales gas volume growth please
e-mail the volume numbers to me...thanks

Subject:	Third Quarter Review of Northern and Transwestern

	
FYI, 

Andersen has agreed that they will be able to issue review reports on the pipelines based on the following terms:

1.  The review opinions must be restricted to the lenders only.
2.  There must be a substantial footnote on the ""overhang"" issues (i.e., SEC investigation, potential bankruptcy, asset carryvalues in certain situations, etc.)
3.  The review opinion will contain an emphasis of matter paragraph related to the above footnote.
4.  ENE management rep and O/S legal must rep that nothing they are working on (related to investigation) affects the pipelines or its management.
5.  Pipelines must represent that it is not involved in any of the matters under investigation.

In addition to the above, AA  believes that they must expand their review work in order to satisfy themselves related to the issues and reps required above.

In connection with all of this, the banks need these reviews completed by the closing date which is currently expected to be November 9.



I believe that the following are our immediate to do's in order to get Andersen started:

1.  Ene to provide full quarterly statements of Northern and Transwestern to Andersen ASAP.
2.  Discuss w/ Willard/Duncan the level of detail/analysis that they will need to perform review.
3.  Provide necessary PBC schedules, etc.
4.  Draft the footnote discussed in 2. above and get approved by Rick and Legal
5.  Get Andersen to draft the language they would like to see in rep letters.  Get approved by Rick/ Legal.



As to each of the above to do's, 

Gary  - can you contact the pipeline group as soon as you get in this morning and see if the financial statements for the 3Q have already been put together.  If they have not, we need to get them produced ASAP.  They have already been put on notice that these statements will be a priority.  Also, lets see what type of support they typically provide to AA for their quarterly financial reveiws.   I assume the scopes will now be much lower since the reviews are on stand alone pipes instead of ENE Consol.

Bob - can you call Saunders and fill him in?  Once I get in I want to talk to Duncan and Willard about #2, #4 and #5 above. You are welcome to be a part of those discussions.  Also we should discuss what we believe the appropriate scopes to be.

Rick - Any thoughts on the above Andersen requirements?  Other thoughts?

If I have missed any critical steps that you can think of, please let me know.

It is now 4:00 a.m.  I plan to be in by around 10:00 a.m.  If you need me for any reason call me at home (832-593-8065).  Thanks.

I think for December we should leave it as is while we see what the fallout is going to be. But, if we do not have plans to build by year-end, it probably should go to Corp vacant.  ROD, do you agree?

And by the way...do we want to keep it that way for EB 41 or do we want to switch to another category (Corp vacant) since you guys are not using that floor?  What do you think, Pam?

Ruthann,

In October and November,  the billing for the entire 41st floor was taken to 0366/111718 per management's direction while under reconstruction.

To my knowledge, that is still the case.

Please contact, Deborah Bubenko regarding construction completion.

Thank you.

The October EPSC invoice showed the following floor space being billed incorrectly to 0366/111692:

Room #		Should be billed to		Sq. ft	
ECN 4106		0366/112476		547

ECN 4751		0366/112476		314

Also on their October invoice, there is an entry for rent correction for 1154 sq.ft. The ticket number is EBR10019310085, dated 10/17/01. I looked at all my rent corrections submitted, and it isn't one of mine. Could you please advise what rooms this correction covers?

Rod,

I agree with Kenneth Cessac's response.  We should evaluate our current process for collecting, validating and distributing measurement data and consider new ideas and alternatives to improve the process.  Assistance from a consulting firm that specializes in this area would probably be better than using Rutherford.

Subject:	RE: Need for Rutherford Consulting Complete

This question has been raised several times over the past 10+ years, should we combine GMS, Field Operations, and some of the Gas Control functions to create a single source for measurement data.  I do not feel that changing a reporting relationship would correct any problems.  

I feel the time and effort can e better spent improving our current data collect process and data flow between SCADA and PGAS.  While this process is working I feel that it requires to much manual intervention and handling.  The IT department, Measurement Technology, Gas Control Hot Seat, and the Data Analysis are all involved in keeping the data flowing between SCADA and PGAS.  We should step back and re look and the current process and see what improvements can be made to better control and maintain this process.

 A second area that should be looked at is the data validation process.  Currently Field Operations, Data Analysis, and GMS all  manually review measurement data.  With all of the computer and software technology available I feel that we could easily automate most of the current manual data validation.

I have limited experience with the Rutherford company and what they could provide towards improving these items.  I feel that a company that specializes in SCADA and such as UTSI would be a better option.

Subject:	RE: Need for Rutherford Consullting Complete

The PGAS reporting project recently completed requirements gathering meetings with data users in gas measurement technology, gas control, gms, gas accounting, and gas logistics.  We think, those discussions have pointed to a need to assess inefficiencies that appear to exist related to data integrity as data moves between systems and users that span the entire gas volume/quality collection, transformation and delivery process.  In other words there seem to be too many questions and reconcilliations that people have to address along the process as data changes hands and is used for different internal and external purposes.  There also appears to be a lack of a single point of responsibility in the organization for gas volume data from start to finish.
The PGAS reporting project proposed to assess this at a high level and make some recommendations.  But as important as the issue appears to be, you might want to consider using Rutherford to help ETS do a more thorough job of this.
This effort would extend outside FA&A.
Please advise.

Mike, Ellis and I are in agreement that the need for the Rutherford Consulting group is complete.  Rutherford achieved what their goal was; to provide structure and format for the PGAS issues to be addressed in an efficient manner.  The procedures for listing new issues are in place and are being followed by the team.  The meetings are efficient in that only status updates and priorities are reviewed and discussed. There is now only one list for all issues that are being addressed or need to be addressed and they are prioritized.   The monthly meetings are now only needed twice a month.  What is the procedure for notifying Rutherford that their services are no longer needed on this project as they have completed what was asked of them?   cvb

Enron Property Services may need us to move Accounting from the 9th to the 8th floor - this is due to the relocation of personnel from 21&22 to 9&10.  They are to get back to me today or early next week with more details.  Do we know already or would it be possible to expedite the answer to Accounting's long term home from an organizational standpoint?  Depending on the answer maybe it would be possible to move them to their 'final' home now (if it is outside of EEOS) instead of moving them twice.

Please advise,
Marilyn

All spending that can be delayed needs to be delayed.

Rod,  for operational storage purchases we backed away from using a DASH to document signoff mainly because the purchase was determined to be non-discretionary (and cleared that with RAC).  Instead we got Stan's approval of the purchase by e-mail.  Given that the Cunningham purchase is budgeted (for 2002), the timing of beginning to enter the transactions, and the above, I would recommend requesting Stan's signoff by email.  OK?

Rod,

The Measurement Services Group would prefer to utilize UTSI as the external consultant for this review process due to their knowledge and experience in SCADA systems.  Internally, we need to include representatives from Gas Control, Gas Logistics, Measurement Desk, Gas Measurement Services and Field Measurement Services.

If you are in agreement, how should we proceed from here?

Rod,

I agree with Kenneth Cessac's response.  We should evaluate our current process for collecting, validating and distributing measurement data and consider new ideas and alternatives to improve the process.  Assistance from a consulting firm that specializes in this area would probably be better than using Rutherford.

Subject:	RE: Need for Rutherford Consulting Complete

This question has been raised several times over the past 10+ years, should we combine GMS, Field Operations, and some of the Gas Control functions to create a single source for measurement data.  I do not feel that changing a reporting relationship would correct any problems.  

I feel the time and effort can e better spent improving our current data collect process and data flow between SCADA and PGAS.  While this process is working I feel that it requires to much manual intervention and handling.  The IT department, Measurement Technology, Gas Control Hot Seat, and the Data Analysis are all involved in keeping the data flowing between SCADA and PGAS.  We should step back and re look and the current process and see what improvements can be made to better control and maintain this process.

 A second area that should be looked at is the data validation process.  Currently Field Operations, Data Analysis, and GMS all  manually review measurement data.  With all of the computer and software technology available I feel that we could easily automate most of the current manual data validation.

I have limited experience with the Rutherford company and what they could provide towards improving these items.  I feel that a company that specializes in SCADA and such as UTSI would be a better option.

Subject:	RE: Need for Rutherford Consullting Complete

The PGAS reporting project recently completed requirements gathering meetings with data users in gas measurement technology, gas control, gms, gas accounting, and gas logistics.  We think, those discussions have pointed to a need to assess inefficiencies that appear to exist related to data integrity as data moves between systems and users that span the entire gas volume/quality collection, transformation and delivery process.  In other words there seem to be too many questions and reconcilliations that people have to address along the process as data changes hands and is used for different internal and external purposes.  There also appears to be a lack of a single point of responsibility in the organization for gas volume data from start to finish.
The PGAS reporting project proposed to assess this at a high level and make some recommendations.  But as important as the issue appears to be, you might want to consider using Rutherford to help ETS do a more thorough job of this.
This effort would extend outside FA&A.
Please advise.

Mike, Ellis and I are in agreement that the need for the Rutherford Consulting group is complete.  Rutherford achieved what their goal was; to provide structure and format for the PGAS issues to be addressed in an efficient manner.  The procedures for listing new issues are in place and are being followed by the team.  The meetings are efficient in that only status updates and priorities are reviewed and discussed. There is now only one list for all issues that are being addressed or need to be addressed and they are prioritized.   The monthly meetings are now only needed twice a month.  What is the procedure for notifying Rutherford that their services are no longer needed on this project as they have completed what was asked of them?   cvb

Rod,

Hopefully, the firewall procedure would be enough for FERC on the trading data we provide.
However, it would be better if we could cut back on providing specific data.
Do you see any way to do this?

I have the following comments:
Credit Data
I believe the write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Paul on this memo to confirm.

Financial Trading Risk Data
We provide aggregate position data for ETS not aggregate VAR, e.g.  ETS is long 10 MMCFD natural gas at Ventura for January 2002, etc. vs. ETS has $1.5 million total VAR.  This is necessary for two reasons: 1.) Enron's VAR does not necessarily equal the sum of its subsidiaries VAR since there may be offsetting positions  throughout the business units.  2.)  Our trading books software (Caminus) does not have the capability to compute VAR in accordance with the specific methodology required (Monte Carlo simulation) in the Enron policy.

Project Analysis Data
I think this write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Lisa and Cheryl to confirm.

Hi Rod,

I know you will be looking into cost and support issues relating to the services we get from Enron Global Finance.  I am of the opinion that the dedication of a talented Global Finance professional will provide us with a much better work product (service) at a significantly lower cost, if we can get EGF to allocate 100% of the cost of the employee and eliminate their allocation to us entirely.

I would like to suggest that you consider Dan Castagnola as the dedicated resource.  Not only is Dan very familiar with all or a majority of our projects from both the commercial as well as the finance perspective, but in my experience working with him, he is an extremely creative and talented business person.  I would feel very fortunate to have Dan on my team.

Just a recommendation ... 

Thanks, Mariella

ps: Jeff has worked with Dan so he can also give you his independent perspective.

From a valuation standpoint I assume Case 1 would give us the highest multiple.  The issue is is it doable?  We have achieved $600 million last year.  Also, before we go further with Project Armstrong I would like to get Whalley and Dynegy to agree that if the discussions are successful we would do the deal.  Let's suspend these discussions for the time being.

Rod,
Attached are three cases for Project Armstrong.  I know you're out of the office until Wednesday but I thought if you could respond by Blackberry or phone as to which case we should send to TCPL, I would get that to them before the holiday so they could work on it Thursday and Friday.

*	Case 1 is an 8% distribution growth case (starting with the plan and increasing acquisition activity to deliver 8% growth).  To achieve that our total capex for NBP goes up to an average of just over $400 million per year.
*	Case 2 tracks with our budget case and involves about $200 million in capex per year and results in 2 years of 8% growth and then a flat distribution level for the remaining 3 years.
*	Case 3 utilizes the budget case but eliminates all acquisitions (capex is about $30 - $40 million average per year for maintenance and asset development) and assumes NBPL recontracting occurs at 85% of max rates.  The result is distributions increase to $3.30 in 2002 and stay at that level throughout the 5 year period.

Obviously Case 1 is the most aggressive in terms of valuation among the three.  Please let me know if that is ok to send or do you have something else in mind.  Also I could fax hard copies if you would like...

Rod - the banks are asking what our plan is regarding the EOTT shares and the conversion.  I was wondering where you saw the process standing.  I've heard that there has been some trouble in the recap events and I didn't know if the conversion vote was tied to that or if we were planning on going ahead with it as soon as possible.  I believe the Koch deal on the subs expires at year end, but I'm not sure.  Also, Gay Mayeaux has been calling me on what's going on with Nikita and I directed her to you to discuss why ETS was selling its EOTT shares.  When you get a chance, will you let me know what the update is?  Thanks.

Hope Acosta in Right of Way advised me this afternoon that she had submitted a churn request yesterday (#10956) to move the phone from 3AC3172 to 3179, and that the request had been approved by the Move Team and Christina Yepez for tonight (11/13). They plan to have their desktop support person move the computer equipment in the morning from 3172 to 3179. I asked Hope if she entered your name for notification e-mail on the churn request, however she said she wasn't aware she was supposed to. She listed Johnny McGee, her Director, for notification e-mail.

Liz Beddingfield from Right of Way called me yesterday, asking about submitting a churn, and I told her we are currently not scheduling moves unless they affect the safety of a person or the pipeline. I suggested they leave the person in 3172 and let Janice Holloway, who's coming over from Corp for one month to work on a project for Don Hawkins, move into 3179. They expressed concern about giving up 3179, which is a larger, outside office with a window. I assured her Janice would only be here until the end of the year at most, and they would not be giving up that office.

Since they have already scheduled this move, I will put Janice Hollaway in 3172 tomorrow. I need approval to have a telephone installed for her.

Thank you.

If you have not been asked, you may want to start thinking about it.  Rick said that there may be a request coming to complete the list this week (and to notify people as early as next week), although he has not as yet received that request.

Importance:	High

I received a voicemail from Miranda while I was out of the office last week indicating that all vacancies require re-justification/authorization.

I had been interviewing for the open accountant position prior to leaving for vacation.  I have interviewed one internal and two external candidates.  I had indicated I would be notifying them this week of my hiring decision. The position needs to be filled for the following reasons:

Northern Border Partners has completed 3 major acquisitions this year and one at the end of third quarter last year.
We have been transitioning these companies to SAP this year resulting in significantly higher maintenance time for additional companies, all internal coding (Cost centers/FARorders), intercompany reconcilliations, account reconcilliations.
All companies are consolidated with Northern Border Partners requiring financial statement preparation
We will be bringing on Midwestern Gas Transmission Company effective January 1.  Their accounting in currently being done by El Paso through the end of the year.
We continue to be behind on certain routine activities, bank reconcilliations being the primary one.  With the additional companies, this has increased the level of activity in this area.
IPayit has created additional manual accounts payable processing due to issues with payment processing through the system.
All of the additional companies has resulted in additional wire transfer activity which is all entered manually in our department.
The acquisition of a Canadian operation has resulted in significant time required in working with the 3rd party that  is operating this facility as well as now requiring foreign currency translation.
New accounting requirements are requiring additional analysis and reporting requirements.

I am available to discuss any of the above issues at your convenience.

The implementation of Operator Qualification has stretched the resources of the Technical Training Group.  Operator Qualification will also require future enhancements to the Skill Based Pay and Training Systems. Currently, I'm the only one in the group that understands relational databases well enough  to plan for system enhancements or troubleshoot data problems.  Data integrity and accuracy will be critical in managing the Operator Qualification program.

To solve this problem, I suggested that we fill our vacancy with an Administration Specialist that has a strong background in system solutions.

Below I've outlined a few of the responsibilities of the Administration Specialist.      

1.      Create plans for the future development of the Skill Based Pay, Training, and Operator Qualification systems, which will maximize the system's capabilities and support team objectives. 

2.      Work with management, EH&S, Pipeline Safety, and HR to understand their needs and develop effective system solutions.

3.      Ensure data integrity and accuracy in the Skill Based Pay, Training, and Operator Qualification systems. 
4.      Maximize the interface of the Training systems with other related employee information systems (SAP, Envision, Contracts DB, MP5, etc.); 

5.      Manage the self-service capabilities in order to empower the organization to access the Skill Based Pay, Training, and Operator Qualification information directly; 

6.      Develop reports, which transform Skill Based Pay and Training data into information, upon which management can base strategic decisions and improve operational efficiency. 

7.      Stay abreast of related technology and recommend future system enhancements, training software purchases, and/or system upgrades.

8.      Provide audio, audio visual and digital graphics support for the development of web based multi-media training modules.

I have already conducted interviews and have worked with Dan Batista to prepare an offer.  I am ready to conclude this offer and fill this vacancy.

Please approve and forward to Dan Batista.

Thanks,

Thanks Rod.

Although I do not think RAC has approved the proposed transaction, I do know that RAC has gone over our models several times and, as recently as a few weeks, and has signed off on our Fair Market Value, which is some 20 to 30% below the proposed purchase price from the utility.  By copy of this to Steve (J), Steve (H) and Lian, I am asking them to start a formal process right now.

I have a quick question here:

In the LOI with the GoPhil., parties are required to show BoDirectors approval for the transaction.  This transaction will net to Enron approx. $100 million.  This is a divestiture and I don't know how we are handling approvals for that.  Can you help me understand the approval process and whether given such the Dec 1 deadline will be an issue?  I would think not but wanted to check.

I have the following comments:
Credit Data
I believe the write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Paul on this memo to confirm.

Financial Trading Risk Data
We provide aggregate position data for ETS not aggregate VAR, e.g.  ETS is long 10 MMCFD natural gas at Ventura for January 2002, etc. vs. ETS has $1.5 million total VAR.  This is necessary for two reasons: 1.) Enron's VAR does not necessarily equal the sum of its subsidiaries VAR since there may be offsetting positions  throughout the business units.  2.)  Our trading books software (Caminus) does not have the capability to compute VAR in accordance with the specific methodology required (Monte Carlo simulation) in the Enron policy.

Project Analysis Data
I think this write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Lisa and Cheryl to confirm.

The bigger question is that they can not loan money to Enron and can only dividend, so if they can do something to raise the cash, they still can't get it out any more out than they can by dividending.    The other problem is that they are running into cash problems themselves since they were in the process of going to the bond markets when all of this occurred, and were advised to wait.   Their receivables from California are part of the problem.   More update later.

Subject:	Floor Space Announcement


I was very disappointed to not have any advance warning about the announcement that construction on 41 has been put on hold for financial reasons.

The Gas Logistics team was ""relocated"" off the 41st floor on October 5.  Prior to the move, we had a very efficient, open configuration that let us work together as a unified team.  

After the move, we are located on 3 different floors.   Besides the general impact on team unity, this move also means that our evening staff work alone on separate floors, rather than in a group.  It means fewer individuals to cover customer calls.  It means having more equipment to cover the day to day business.   I have worked hard to calm the team that this arrangement is just temporary and that we will eventually be put back together as a team.

Prior to our move I constantly questioned whether our move was necessary.  I asked about smaller, more practical changes to fit more people on the floor.  And, I specifically asked about whether Enron issues might impact the groups desire to continue to spend $7-$10 million -- even as I reluctantly packed up my boxes.

I hope you can appreciate that the current seating arrangement is a serious issue for my team and one that generates constant questions as my staff meetings.  Finding out  that we moved off of 41 for no reason at an all-employee floor meeting undermines my team's faith in my leadership.

Subject: SoCalGas Complaint (Message from Greg Porter)




MESSAGE FROM GREG PORTER

________________________________________________
As you know, Transwestern filed a complaint against Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on September 28, 2001.  The complaint asked FERC to find SoCalGas' refusal to pay the tariff commodity rate constitutes a violation of Transwestern's tariff and the 1995 Global Settlement.  SoCalGas filed an Answer on October 18, 2001.  In summary, SoCalGas' Answer stated:

1.	SoCalGas did not affirmatively agree to pay the stated tariff rate during the Global Settlement.  

2.	The commodity charge SoCal has been paying is consistent with the course of performance/conduct prior to, and after, the Global Settlement.  

3.	Since the Global Settlement has been in effect, SoCalGas has relied on the commodity/usage charges that Transwestern has billed.    

4.	SoCalGas claims they had been paying the appropriate rate and that Transwestern failed to include the correct rate in its tariff; such omission has created ambiguity and any ambiguity should be construed against the drafter of the tariff, Transwestern.

5.	If the Commission disagrees with SoCalGas and declines to reject the complaint outright, any retroactive billing adjustment should be limited to a six-month period.

6.	SoCalGas admits that a retroactive billing adjustment for the escalation factor for six months is reasonable and an escalation factor going forward for the remaining term of its Contract No. 8255 is appropriate.

In addition to the foregoing statements, SoCalGas provided that it, like Transwestern, was interested in resolving this matter through ADR.  Accordingly, we will be coordinating with SoCalGas and FERC's ADR group to explore possible ADR procedures.

We will advise as new developments warrant.  In the meantime, should you have any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me at (402) 398-7406 or Maria Pavlou at (402) 398-7097.

Yes.  They want us to record the amounts loaned, normal loans, as a reduction of equity, if ENE does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability.  They do not want to count the 1.5B or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes.  They are specifically concerned about the current intercompany notes.

How's this?

Recently we've had a couple of mix ups regarding vacant office space and phone moves. In light of this, we'd like to help by coordinating the moves in 3AC like we've been doing in the Enron Building. We know you are all very busy, and we'll be happy to submit move requests for you, including telephone moves and reassignments.

This will also enable us to keep current on floor space billing and make sure it gets corrected when an employee moves.

Please contact Ruthann (x66538) for assistance with any moves in 3AC, and Pam (x36135) for assistance with any moves in the Enron Building. Of course, if one of us is unavailable, feel free to call the other. If an office or cubicle is vacant and you would like to put someone in it, please contact us, so we can help coordinate it and hopefully avoid confusion.

Thanks for your help.

Pam Daily and Ruthann Frausto

Maybe overkill, I would rather send them an email talking about the problems, and they have to let you 2 know when they going to use a space, and how they can coordinate stuff with you 2 instead of dictating.

That sounds good. We might also want to include any other request that would potentially use a ""space"" such as tables for data rooms, contractors, etc. If they think it only applies if they are actually moving a person or phone, the spaces we think we have available may be used without churns. For instance, sometimes I think spaces are available for use, only to find boxes and/or equipment has been set up. Just a thought. What do you think -- overkill?

What do you think of this to send out to the admins in 3AC?

In an effort to better control our space planning needs, effective immediately all ETS moves will be coordinated by Pam Daily and Ruthann Frausto. This pertains to all moves, including telephone only moves.

Please contact Pam (X36135)  regarding any moves in the Enron Building, and contact Ruthann (x66538) regarding any moves in the 3AC building. Of course, if one of us is unavailable, feel free to contact the other.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Jim, thanks for the note.  Please forward this on to Clint Walden, Rick Causey and Rod Hayslett (and anyone else you think needs this information)

I have a couple of comments on the conditions below that were discussed on the phone but were not included in the list below.  We would expect a
representation from the Board as well as outside legal counsel on point #4 below.  Also, I assume this review is a condition precedent in the debt
documents.  Enron should be aware that there may be issues that arise that do not allow us to complete our work in the timetable necessary and should
consider whether wording the loan documents relating to this cp should be modified to describe the review as something that is a condition precendent
""if it is professionally able to be completed.""   Also, all of these conditions assume there are no financial obligations from the entities in
the reviews from or to Enron corp.  If so, those contractual relationships will need to be evaluted to determine if ""overhang"" issues combined with
the financial obligations might preclude us from completing our review.   This is a high priority item.  I would ask that the company assist us in
immediately identifying and evaluating those financial obligations, if any,  to determine if significant issues exist.  We can get started now on that.
Please call Heather Mueck and Chris Herbold.  I would like to get that identification work completed by end of business tomorrow.  Heather and
Gerrad will be leading the review work and Chris will be assisting also.

Overall debt questions.  We need to understand terms, conditions and debt documents.  Who has these? We are ready to start reviewing today.

Financial statements and review work. What periods are going to be included in the documents? The comment below says quarterly.  Which quarters?
Year-to-date? Comparison to prior years? We would expect a full set of financial statements with footnotes for all periods presented (balance
sheets, income statements and cash flows?   Who is drafting the footnote that describes the overhang issues? This is a high priority item that will
get much review and scrutiny. l would like to get the Company's signed off footnote disclosure on the ""overhang"" issues tomorrow.  Also, we will need
immediate access to the financials and your people to answer questions. When can we get the financials that will be included in the deal.  I assume
Enron personnel will be available to answer questions 24/7 beginning today to complete this work in the necessary timeframe?

I know these are many questions.  More to come I am sure.  But I also want to get started and focused on time consuming issues.  We will be
determining our expanded scope procedures that are referred to below.

As such, please talk with your CAO's and/or BU leaders as part of your 2002 risk assessment and obtain answers to the following questions and send them back to me on or before Thanksgiving.  Please let me know if you're having any problems with this or need further clarification.


* Do the business units know the scope and nature of social and environmental risks associated with their business strategy, transactions, assets, countries where they operate, and/or counter parties? 
* Do the business units have a process to identify social and environmental risk?
* If so, what process does the business units employ in order to identify and manage social and environmental risk?
* What process do the business units use to quantify and/or qualify these exposures?
* Who is responsible for managing this process in the business?  
* Does the business review the quality of their social/environmental risk assessment and management activities?
* Is the business unit aware of the existing corporate function and processes?

This information will help Ken and his task team to  develop a proposed process for developing a consistent process for measuring social/environmental risk management performance across the business.  We may be asked for more assistance in this area in 2002.

Thank you for your assistance!

I did not want to spend much time on this if someone else was already working on it.  Sounds interesting, and I haven't heard anyone else talk about it.

On an unrelated topic, at some point, you and I should sit down with Jeff to discuss financing roles/responsibilities of EGS.  I would like to see less corp financing of EGS assets (especially when we are unaware of them a la TOPRs), since we will have to live with these deals post mortem.    I agree

In planning office space for the EGS legal group, please hold a space for Paulette Obrecht.  She has served in a number of roles in the legal department over the years but would be invaluable in keeping us, er, me, organized.  She is presently on the Corp. payroll.

All spending that can be delayed needs to be delayed.

Here's a little more detail on the voice mail I left you earlier.  The banks want more than just secured debt.  They want a mortgage on all of TW and NNG's real property.  That's right, they want a filing with every county courthouse where NNG and TW own assets.  I want to talk to you tomorrow before Stan's meeting about why that is just a terrible idea.  In short, at the same time we are doing this big loan and cash infusion into ENA to ""calm the market"" we will simultaneously have dozens of right of way guys and local real estate lawyers crawling all over the place doing something I don't think any pipeline has done before (at least not in my memory).  Nevertheless, I want to be able to move forward if there is no alternative.  For us to prepare mortgage documents we need (I think) to have approximate property values by county.  Do we have this info somewhere?  Are ad valorem tax values kept by county?  I don't think our FERC books will be much help on this.  Lou is getting Johnny McGee and some folks together after Stan's meeting to talk to me and the Vinson and Elkins folks about how we can do this project if we have to.  It will be a challenge, particularly in the 2 week timetable they are talking about.       Talk to you tomorrow.  DF

Yes.  They want us to record the amounts loaned, normal loans, as a reduction of equity, if ENE does not currently have the ability to repay from either cash or other assets or credit capability.  They do not want to count the 1.5B or the bank loans since they will simply increase the size of the notes.  They are specifically concerned about the current intercompany notes.

This is a position that we have been working on for approximately the last six weeks.   Joe has completed interviews and is ready to finalize an offer to an individual that currently works in the IT department for Nick Rahn.   This position will broaden his work requirements beyond the IT world, and his knowledge of the databases will be extremely valuable to the successful execution of the Skill Base Pay program and the new Operator Qualification program under development.
 
If you approve, please forward to Dan Batista in HR.

Subject: Administration Specialist for Technical Training



The implementation of Operator Qualification has stretched the resources of the Technical Training Group.  Operator Qualification will also require future enhancements to the Skill Based Pay and Training Systems. Currently, I'm the only one in the group that understands relational databases well enough  to plan for system enhancements or troubleshoot data problems.  Data integrity and accuracy will be critical in managing the Operator Qualification program.

To solve this problem, I suggested that we fill our vacancy with an Administration Specialist that has a strong background in system solutions.

Below I've outlined a few of the responsibilities of the Administration Specialist.      

1.      Create plans for the future development of the Skill Based Pay, Training, and Operator Qualification systems, which will maximize the system's capabilities and support team objectives. 

2.      Work with management, EH&S, Pipeline Safety, and HR to understand their needs and develop effective system solutions.

3.      Ensure data integrity and accuracy in the Skill Based Pay, Training, and Operator Qualification systems. 
4.      Maximize the interface of the Training systems with other related employee information systems (SAP, Envision, Contracts DB, MP5, etc.); 

5.      Manage the self-service capabilities in order to empower the organization to access the Skill Based Pay, Training, and Operator Qualification information directly; 

6.      Develop reports, which transform Skill Based Pay and Training data into information, upon which management can base strategic decisions and improve operational efficiency. 

7.      Stay abreast of related technology and recommend future system enhancements, training software purchases, and/or system upgrades.

8.      Provide audio, audio visual and digital graphics support for the development of web based multi-media training modules.

I have already conducted interviews and have worked with Dan Batista to prepare an offer.  I am ready to conclude this offer and fill this vacancy.

Please approve and forward to Dan Batista.

Thanks,

All spending that can be delayed needs to be delayed.	I want to make it clear that items for health, safety, security and reliability that need to be spent will be spent, if necessary, but all other spending needs to be slowed down as much as possible and delayed until further notice.   This is a directive I have just received from Stan.

I am hearing all sorts of noise and need confirmation and guidance.  Phil Lowry just have Nick Rahn $2.7 mil to do various upgrades in the field, from server upgrades to phone switch upgrades as well as purchase the new software/hardware for the PHD rewrite. All are necessary upgrades if not done this year will have to be done next year.  Not one of these upgrades projects is over $900k but together it totals $2.7.  We also are continuing to do upgrades in the Houston offices - all budgeted items and if not upgraded this year will have to be done next year.  Do I say STOP - and if so for all companies or just for NNG and TW?   cvb

These guys are stepping up for us in every way....they (along with ING) are 100% behind us and are putting their money on it.  Also BNP Pays Bas is having an awful time with their credit committee...the business people have approved this and do not feel that Enron's problem effects us but the credit committee is not so forgiving.  If Kelly or anyone can do anything to help Paysbas in this situation it would be greatly appreciated.   My account executive there is Lincoln Payton and Marci Weiss...

Would you be so kind as to pass this along to Kelly or anyone else that you feel appropriate?

Subject:	Confidential - Decision tree on projects

Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting.

There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaza.  In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans.  SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem.  Panama is much less (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year.  Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM.  In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama.  The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from actions taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with private parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a ""mark"" on the company's liquidity position.  

Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence?  The same could go for SECLP and Gaza.

This is simply an overall ""guidance"" question.  Let's take it up during our staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you.

Many thanks, Mariella

In Stan's staff meeting this morning he asked we let you know of any vacancies that are being filled.  I have two that are currently in process: 
*	Director, Financial Planning -recruiting internally and externally on a concurrent basis due primarily to Omaha location,  preference given to internal candidates.
*	Financial Planning Analyst (Ben Humann's vacancy) - recruiting internally only.

For either of these positions I think Enron should be willing to pay relocation if necessary (to avoid severance costs).  From the standpoint of the partnerships I don't think NBP should pay this cost since there are plenty of local candidates from which to choose.

Please find attached file. Transportation & Storage Revenue is right off the Earning Model Income Statement. Carlton data can be found in the Commercial Function detail within the ""Database"" worksheet of the Earning Model. The Cash Flow verbiage is very general related to the subject matter, but does provide a business reason on a Direct Cash Flow basis for an item buried within the Indirect Cash Flow format. Call me if you have any further questions.

Subject: Weekly Report


Stan/Jim,
 
Following is a list of last week's most salient events.
 
Central America/DR:
 
Guatemala:  MARAD will reply this week as to their position vis-a-vis the reduction of Enron's contingent support from $28 to $10 million.  It is possible they will ask for additional information.  
 
Nicaragua:  Current credit ratings required the funding of approximately $6.3 million into a debt service reserve account (project was allowed to sweep the funds against a corporate guarantee by Enron, which was backstopped by the partners pro-rata to their ownership in the project).  Partners to reimburse Enron their pro-rata share, such that Enron's ultimate outflow will be approximately $2.2 million.  Team tried to get MARAD to agree to alternative solutions but MARAD simply refused citing bad past experience and political implications.
 
Panama:  Team in Houston last week to review the upcoming PPA bids by Elektra (one of the two distribution companies in Panama).  Three issues are worth noting: (i) requirement to post bid bonds (approximately $10 million) will likely need some sort of Enron support (BLM can't get bid bonds on its own although local management continues attempting to do so); (ii) BLM's marginal costs are among highest in Panama.  A preliminary strategy has been mapped out; and (iii) PPA terms are a bit ""one-sided"" in favor of the distributor.  BLM and other market participants have tried repeatedly to get the distco to change terms without success.  
 
Dominican Republic:  El Paso confirmed it can't work with us.  Operationally, the plant is working well.  As noted on an earlier e-mail, EFI's fuel supplier for SECLP, Vitol, asked for a letter of credit or pre-payment terms.  Enron rejected the request.  SECLP bought cargo directly from Vitol.  We are working closely with Tom Moran of ENE credit on these issues.
 
Ecoelectrica:
This week was a very productive week.  Update as follows:  Lender Process:  Based on several conversations this week, lenders have stated they understand that Mirant's insurance package is the result of market conditions.  Lenders are prepared to pursue credit committee approval with the $300 million coverage.  Mirant offered a 6-month only waiver on the deductibles.  Lenders appear content with that option.  ENE insurance has approximately 75% of the underwriters on board with our back-up plan to provide the additional $200 million tranche.  Backup will be used only if credit committee(s) kick back existing coverage.  Mirant to issue a certification of compliance with QF (by Eco) and a legal opinion asap.  Based on the progress this week and the remaining commitment on deliverables, it is expected that the lender's agent can put together the entire lender package and submit it to the lender group by Tuesday of next week.  Finally, Mirant also committed to providing comments (if any) to the Lender Consent Agreement.  ENE and EME have reviewed and provided comments already.  GE Consent:  Mirant committed to sending their ""versions"" of the key documents on the GE buy-out on Friday nite (late).  I have not seen the document but they have repeatedly stated that the documents are ""conforming"".  Union Carbide Guarantee:  Plan to finalize language early next week.  Schedule:  Mirant has committed to fulfilling CP's as early as possible (and is acting on that statement) as long as we can allow them to fund on 12/19.  They state they are confident they can close CP's by earlier than 12/14 and can fund on 12/19.  CSFB has not shed light on the apparent funding (timing) limitation but has offered to investigate further.  
 
APACHI  
 
Philippines: The team did an excellent job of advancing discussions and negotiations with NPC but was unable to move the slow government machinery fast enough to make it to a signing by last Thursday's New York event.  Nevertheless, momentum is high and team continues to work toward a 12/15 agreement date; funding wouldn't occur until early next year. 
 
Guam:  Continue discussions with Mirant and AES with a focus on getting them over the hump on the issue of Enron's contingent obligation to cover the potential shortfall under a GPA buy-out event.  Work continues.  Meetings have been set with Dr. Boyce to discuss his interest in the Guam project.  
 
China:  Unit 2 still scheduled to come back on line on 11/23.  Two likely causes still under investigation (poor vaccum or material design flaw).  Work on capital reduction for Chengdu on hold until discussions are held with Houston to ensure consensus.  In the mean time, several parties have approached us with interest in Chengdu.  On Hainan, team is paying several visits to the new SAFE representatives, first to work on the mid November repayment ($10 million).   Next step would be liquidation.  
 
Europe  
 
Gaza:  Waiting to hear from CCC (partner) on conceptual proposal: ENE to provide limited technical support and financial services support to help put in place cost over-run facility and to help with remaining construction activities and CCC to take our equity (at no cost) and any remaining obligations.  Aim is to eliminate the potential exposure on ENE's $9 million of guarantees.  
 
Trakya:  During meetings in London, OPIC informed us that they had had good meetings with the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Energy.  Government stated they would ""clean up"" arrears but could not do so before January 2002 (presumably there are no budget funds left).  Government committed to work with OPIC on resolving the forex dispute issue but acknowledged that the legal opinion they had sought and received didn't address the issue properly and thus needed additional work to provide the Government with the backing it needed to give the issue resolution.  OPIC agreed to send the Government ""terms of reference"" on their conceptual agreements.  On our question of change in frequency in the distribution of dividends OPIC stated they would expeditiously move to review our proposal, indicating no pre-disposed position against it.  
 
Sarlux:  team continues to prepare to submit response to EPC contractor's claim, as well as our own counter-claim, all scheduled to be submitted on November 30th.   Team continues to work on sorting out technical issues at the plant, including meetings with senior Texaco officials.  
 
ENS:  local team and Adam Overfield worked to resolve remaining issue over final completion certificate.  Issue was related to CO2 emmissions on GT12 vs the EPC contract parameters.  Team has convinced the lender's engineer that issue is of no relevance.  Team is now moving to secure lender approval.  This releases $1.95 million of contingent support by ENE.  
 
Europe Sales Prospects:  IPower submitted preliminary proposals for ENS and Trakya, both well below expectations.
 
Other:  Team is working closely with RAC to come up with updated fair market valuations, cashflow projections by month for the quarter ended Dec. 31, and revised/updated transfer restriction information.
 
Thanks, Mariella
 
Isabel: please distribute to team as customary.

At mid year, Rodney and Wes went through a fair amount of discussion about whether the transaction accounting folks should be specialized technical or commercial support.  Same for some tax jobs.  It was probably my mistake to not recognize that London's not sticking to the same categorization created a problem.  In the end I think Fernley saw the problem, too.  So if there is a ""message"", it's to Fernley to do what the rest of the Global Accounting group is doing (and that message is pretty explicit below, I think).

I don't believe that there will be any change at year end in the use of Peer Groups (Commercial, Technical, Specialized technical, Commercial Support).  Do we want to go with the same usage of these Peer Groups as we did at mid year?  The one thing I would suggest, if possible, is that London go with the same usage as the rest of the BUs.

Please let me know your opinion on this.  Thanks!

In the ""for what its worth category"", I'm not certain the functional accountability is playing itself out as intended...or maybe it is...

Points of interest on this small project
This project is in Phase VI economics (yet to be formally reviewed and approved)    Probably belongs in the economics.	
It will NOT be in the Phase VI filing     That's to keep it out of the headlights.
$3.5mm was approved by the Board, (but it alledgedly needs $4mm)   We will have to approve the increase.    Commercial will have to take care of getting in on the agenda and a resolution prepared.
Its being functionalized as a ""commercial"" project    I think it is, since it is to support a new FTS-2 commercial transportation contract
Its going to be managed by ""operations""    Not sure what this means 
It will probably actually be built by ""construction and engineering""    I am assuming this is a non-profit transaction and is actually being done without a contract, otherwise the contract will require separate Board Approval.

We are going to give this a ""M"" Capital Budget Code since the cost for the Loop was included in the Phase 6 economics.  I will also count the budget dollars and capital spending in the Commercial budget for 2002 Plan and as we go forward in 2002 and forecast dollars.  So Operations should not count it.  This is how we did the 24"" ML Replacement which was part of P5.  Operations will management the project but Commercial will count the dollars.

I received a call from Jim Guest at the FERC OCA this afternoon concerning the Enron situation.  He had read the articles and heard the reports.  Wanted to know if bad accounting was the root of the problem.  I advised him that it was bad investments that was the real issue. He asked about the use of the pipeline assets to pull Enron thru the liquidity crisis.  I gave him a brief overview of the Dynegy cash infusion and the bank revolvers.  He said there was some concern at the FERC that projects we might be proposing may not be able to be funded due to the reduced ability of the pipelines to obtain outside financing due to the securitization of the all the assets.  I indicated that it was my opinion that good investments in pipeline facilities would probably be looked on favorably at Enron these days.

Thought you?d want a quick update.  I haven?t advised Drew or Greg Porter yet.  Thought you might want to cover with them.

Sally,

In March of 1999, ETS companies, Northern Natural Gas (NNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (TW), signed Confidentiality Agreements with Enron Capital and Trade (ECT) for pricing information.  You were the signatory for ECT at that time.  These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes.  Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.  However, the Confidentiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any other companies.  I would appreciate any assistance you could provide in identifying the new person at ENA/EWS that would handle these duties currently.

Thanks

couple of comments for consideration at 2:00:

1.  we do not want to encourage a 338(h) 10 election for basis reasons that are different than existed in Northern.
2.  I have drafted as though TW is issuing the preferred, for tax reasons that may cost ENE +/- $30 million per year we want Newco 1 to issue.
3.  I am not convinced we want to offer same conversion terms as we did Dynegy.  Areas to think about removing or changing are (i) do we offer the makewhole and (ii) should we replace all ""repurchase"" scenarios with a redemption structure to avoid the whole change of control issue.  
4.  We need to add or relook at the exchange features given the private equity's motivation to participate in the closing of the merger.

John, I think that's adequate.  If a great deal comes up that exceeds that limit we simply have to convince them to grant a waiver, right? Rod, would you confirm please?  Thanks.  DF

Drew,

Can you confirm that Transwestern has a Consolidated Minimum Tangible Net Worth of $250 million and that Northern Natural does not have a Minimum TNW covenant?

Thanks,

David

"FW: Right of Way move","Does this really have to be done?   It's probably too late now, but we really do need to watch our spending for awhile.  I would like to coordinate moves through our move people either Ruth Ann Frausto (3AC) or Pam Daily (EB) so I can keep up with space as well as costs that are coming down the pike.

Hope Acosta in Right of Way advised me this afternoon that she had submitted a churn request yesterday (#10956) to move the phone from 3AC3172 to 3179, and that the request had been approved by the Move Team and Christina Yepez for tonight (11/13). They plan to have their desktop support person move the computer equipment in the morning from 3172 to 3179. I asked Hope if she entered your name for notification e-mail on the churn request, however she said she wasn't aware she was supposed to. She listed Johnny McGee, her Director, for notification e-mail.

Liz Beddingfield from Right of Way called me yesterday, asking about submitting a churn, and I told her we are currently not scheduling moves unless they affect the safety of a person or the pipeline. I suggested they leave the person in 3172 and let Janice Holloway, who's coming over from Corp for one month to work on a project for Don Hawkins, move into 3179. They expressed concern about giving up 3179, which is a larger, outside office with a window. I assured her Janice would only be here until the end of the year at most, and they would not be giving up that office.

Since they have already scheduled this move, I will put Janice Hollaway in 3172 tomorrow. I need approval to have a telephone installed for her.

Thank you.

To confirm, in tpc's financials, tangible net worth does not reflect any increase for fair value. I seemed to recall that the 1B in equity included such amount.
