"Weekly Report for PGE","Regulatory Affairs
- The Oregon Public Utility Commission today hosted a public hearing in
Portland to discuss the impacts of PGE's Oct. 1 price increase. The hearing
was conducted in response to a request by consumer and business interest
groups, even though the 11-month long rate case proceedings are officially
closed and the OPUC approved PGE's request. 

Pamela Lesh, PGE's vice president of Public Policy and Regulatory Affairs,
represented the company at the hearing. Representatives and members of the
interest groups - Industrial Customers of Northwest Utilities, Associated
Oregon Industries, and Citizens Utility Board - also offered their comments. 

Today's hearing is part of a larger campaign by these groups asking for
reconsideration of PGE's rate case. Several weeks ago, the OPUC denied their
request to block the implementation of new rates on October 1, 2001. A second
proposal by these groups is a request for reconsideration, in which the OPUC
could decide to create a plan to mitigate or defer the price increases over
time. This matter has yet to be decided by the OPUC, but we expect them do
deny the reconsideration request. PGE has stated that a price deferral or
""phase-in"" approach would not be wise, because it would create millions of
dollars in debt that would ultimately cost PGE customers more in the long
term.  Beginning this week, all residential and business customers will
receive a special mailing from PGE that provides details on how customers can
use energy wisely and efficiently.

Retail Loads
We're roughly 145 MW behind (Authorized) UE-115 forecast in the last 7 days
and 135 MW behind (120 MW behind when adjusted for weather) in the last 30
days, due to significantly weak demand by manufacturing customers (though
high-tech held up well) and likely commercial (non-manufacturing) customers. 
You may have heard this morning that the U.S. Industrial Production (Index)
fell for 12 months in a row, worse since WWII.

Power Supply
- This past week we have seen the market continue to creep up slowly.  The
daily electric has strengthened mostly off-peak with a slight strengthening
on-peak, on-peak has traded mostly around $24 to $25 and off-peak has steadily
moved up from $18 to $21.  In the cash electric we have been selling about
100MW on-peak and have stayed out of the off-peak market due to the gas price
following the electric for Beaver's dispatch price.  Daily gas we have seen
the prices move up to $2.45 Sumas and settled around $2.06 for tomorrow.  This
has been moving all around with weather forecasts being part of the driver and
threats of storms.  Term electric had climbed slowly this past week with the
feeling that we reached the bottom, but has settled back down to last week
prices.  Term gas has followed the electric with the prices rising slightly
throughout the week then settling down to last week prices.

Overall everything has been very quiet with everything running full out when
the dispatch is below the market.  We aren't anticipating any major
fluctuation in the coming week that would cause either gas or electric to move
dramatically.  All the plants are available and running smoothly.

- El Paso Seasonal Exchange - Negotiations are in process with El Paso on a
seasonal exchange in which PGE may take up to 50 MW of Dec01 and Jan02 power
in four-hour blocks.  Total energy taken by PGE must be returned in Sep02 in
four-hour blocks of El Paso's choice.  El Paso would like to embed a provision
for ""lending"" - commercial terms are being negotiated.

- Intel Blend and Extend - Initial contact with customer has been made and
terms are being revised, as requested by Intel.  At Intel's first
availability, PGE will meet with them to discuss two products: (1) an ""extend
and blend"" financing of a reduced rate increase and (2) an extend and blend
product with financed rate reduction embedded in a collar.

Human Resources
- With ? day's negotiations, Company and IBEW successfully wrapped up
negotiations for a 5-year agreement for the 15 employees at our Coyote Plant.
This unusual agreement which is IPP-like in its wording was unchanged through
the negotiations process, with a cost-of-living adjustment added plus an
increase in the incentive plan of up to 4%. 

- In PGE's main agreement covering 900 bargaining-unit employees, a third vote
was held Wed., 10/17, with the result 631 employee in favor of the new 3-yr
agreement and 174 opposed.  This is a good contract and it brings our
negotiation process to a conclusion.

Finance
A draft 8-K for PGE is out for final review and approval.  Once this is filed
PGE will be able to move forward on a $250 million bond deal structured as a
fall away first mortgage.   Current issuance date for these bonds is scheduled
for October 31 or November 1.

Enron / Northwest Natural Transaction
- Officers of NWN and PGE will meet next week for 2 days to discuss how we
work together during the approval process and the plan for the integration
activity.

- The regulatory and business people will meet next week (evening meeting
while we are at the management meeting)  to discuss regulatory strategy for
the OPUC filing that will request approval for the transaction.  Paul Kaufman
will be included in the discussion along with Dick Reiten, Mark Dodson, Bruce
Debolt, Peggy Fowler, Jim Piro, and Pamela Lesh.

- Final draft of the offering memo on the senior credit facility for the
financing of the transaction is being circulated for review.  Presentations on
the transaction with the potential lead underwriting banks is being scheduled
for October 29 and 30th.

- Beginning information exchange and planning for integration with NW
Natural's Human Resources department, planning for Day One.

"RE: TWP and NNG Stats","Frequency or incident rates are calculated as follows:

Lost Time = no. of incidents x 200,000/total no. man hours worked

Recordable= same as above.  There are individual recordable cases and ALL lost time incidents are counted as ""one"" lost time and ""one"" recordable.  In other words every LT adds one to LT and one to Recordables.

Vehicle Frequency= no. of accidents x 1,000,000/total miles driven.

The footnote disclosure regarding the credit faciltiy mentions the Citibank prepay and the split between NNG and TPC.  We will be trying to include the entire amount in the TPC facilty rather than split the amount.  In addition, the facility will be unwound at the corp level and dropped into TPC, therefore, I am not sure we need to even mention this in the footnotes.

Subject:	EAMR Transactions


This memo is being forwarded to you to address issues that have developed during recent Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) transactions and to establish appropriate procedures for going forward.  EAMR, as you are probably aware, is an affiliate of Enron Transportation Services Company that performs services for third parties as well as other Enron affiliate companies. 

When EAMR enters into a contract with non Enron customers to deliver services, EAMR assumes all of the risk for any losses in the transaction  Additionally, EAMR is not to be supported financially by the affiliated pipelines.  All costs such as employee payroll expenses, travel and other related employee expenses, equipment usage fees, etc  associated with an employee performing services for a customer under an EAMR transaction must be accurately recorded pursuant to prudent accounting procedures. 

Going forward,  to ensure that there are no financial or contractual obligations that are not in the best interest of EAMR, the following process will be used on all transactions.

1) Cost estimates for services through EAMR will be sent to Sarabeth Smith in Houston for review and approval.  Sarabeth will ensure that all costs and appropriate margins are included in the cost structure and then release it through a non-binding agreement for presentation to the customer by appropriate marketing personnel.  Cost estimates, given to customers outside of this step in the process, run the possibility of having to be retracted due to the risk of committing EAMR to a transaction that is not contractually or financially sound.

2) It is the responsibility of every employee performing services for EAMR to be diligent in recording their time and expenses required to perform the services to the appropriately assigned project number.  Monthly reviews of the expenses associated with each project will be conducted to ensure that all costs have been accurately recorded.  Sarabeth will be the point of contact with the transaction originator, contract administration and legal to ensure draft agreements as well as the final agreement have been coordinated through all appropriate groups.   Legal agreements will not be issued without proper sign-off of authorization.

3) All contracts must adhere to fundamental risk parameters set forth by management.  These mandates are very clear concerning contract language and operating parameters for EAMR transactions.  Your cooperation by adhering to the processes described in this memo is critical to  the continued success of EAMR as a revenue generating entity as well as another ""marketing tool"" for the customer.  

Contact Information for EAMR will Sarabeth Smith at 713-345-5023, sarabeth.smith@enron.com, 1400 Smith 3AC-3147, Houston, TX  77002.

Please pass this memo on to team members or other members of your staff that currently work or may work on EAMR transactions. 

Thanks for your support in this endeavor.

Steve,

I was contacted by Teobaldo Camejo Soto (Enron HR - Carribean Basin) regarding the sale of an Enron Asset, Ecco Electrica (sp?).  He indicated the sale of this asset was set to close in ~2 weeks and needed IT support to review all of the systems and software licenses involved.  

I am not sure who in IT should handle this support.  

Thanks,

"Daily Summary of Risk Data","Summary Risk Data as of 11/14/2001		
		
Active Financial Deals	      83	
Active Physical Positions	      38	
P&L  Daily ($thousands)	     10.8 	
VaR ($thousands)	    137.7 	
		
ETS Margin Account Deals	        0	
		



Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Do you have a candidate?    I would argue that we are looking at a process review, so anyone who can do a process review could do this.

Rod,

I agree with Kenneth Cessac's response.  We should evaluate our current process for collecting, validating and distributing measurement data and consider new ideas and alternatives to improve the process.  Assistance from a consulting firm that specializes in this area would probably be better than using Rutherford.

Subject:	RE: Need for Rutherford Consulting Complete

This question has been raised several times over the past 10+ years, should we combine GMS, Field Operations, and some of the Gas Control functions to create a single source for measurement data.  I do not feel that changing a reporting relationship would correct any problems.  

I feel the time and effort can e better spent improving our current data collect process and data flow between SCADA and PGAS.  While this process is working I feel that it requires to much manual intervention and handling.  The IT department, Measurement Technology, Gas Control Hot Seat, and the Data Analysis are all involved in keeping the data flowing between SCADA and PGAS.  We should step back and re look and the current process and see what improvements can be made to better control and maintain this process.

 A second area that should be looked at is the data validation process.  Currently Field Operations, Data Analysis, and GMS all  manually review measurement data.  With all of the computer and software technology available I feel that we could easily automate most of the current manual data validation.

I have limited experience with the Rutherford company and what they could provide towards improving these items.  I feel that a company that specializes in SCADA and such as UTSI would be a better option.

Subject:	RE: Need for Rutherford Consullting Complete

The PGAS reporting project recently completed requirements gathering meetings with data users in gas measurement technology, gas control, gms, gas accounting, and gas logistics.  We think, those discussions have pointed to a need to assess inefficiencies that appear to exist related to data integrity as data moves between systems and users that span the entire gas volume/quality collection, transformation and delivery process.  In other words there seem to be too many questions and reconcilliations that people have to address along the process as data changes hands and is used for different internal and external purposes.  There also appears to be a lack of a single point of responsibility in the organization for gas volume data from start to finish.
The PGAS reporting project proposed to assess this at a high level and make some recommendations.  But as important as the issue appears to be, you might want to consider using Rutherford to help ETS do a more thorough job of this.
This effort would extend outside FA&A.
Please advise.

Mike, Ellis and I are in agreement that the need for the Rutherford Consulting group is complete.  Rutherford achieved what their goal was; to provide structure and format for the PGAS issues to be addressed in an efficient manner.  The procedures for listing new issues are in place and are being followed by the team.  The meetings are efficient in that only status updates and priorities are reviewed and discussed. There is now only one list for all issues that are being addressed or need to be addressed and they are prioritized.   The monthly meetings are now only needed twice a month.  What is the procedure for notifying Rutherford that their services are no longer needed on this project as they have completed what was asked of them?   cvb

Keep San Juan shippers whole and get imbalance gas back by year end

Cut San Juan shippers deliveries and sell excess retained fuel right away

A break even settled San Juan imbalance gas cash out price is determined.

If the settled cash out price is above $4.23/MMBtu, keeping the shippers whole is a better alternative.

Steve,

Enron Property Services may need us to move Accounting from the 9th to the 8th floor - this is due to the relocation of personnel from 21&22 to 9&10.  They are to get back to me today or early next week with more details.  Do we know already or would it be possible to expedite the answer to Accounting's long term home from an organizational standpoint?  Depending on the answer maybe it would be possible to move them to their 'final' home now (if it is outside of EEOS) instead of moving them twice.

Please advise,
Marilyn

During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

If the reimbursement doesn't show up then there is no offset and the dollars spent should end up in rate base.   Isn't that about the way it could happen?

"RE: Memo regarding Enron/Dynegy Agreement and Plan of Merger - Compliance with the Conduct of Business Covenants","With everything going on, I wanted to speak with you about some issues, particularly how things may effect my group.  In light of the attached memo, it does not seem that we can do anything that will cost the company more than $50mm.  What does this mean for what we are looking at?  Can Enron even participate in the Arctic project as a $1mm commitment will, not including the potential additional liabilities, commit the company for more than $50mm.  I guess you can make an argument about it depends upon how you count it.
 
Anyway, please let me know when you have some time.

"Transwestern information requests","Rod:

As per our phone conversation, the list of information we would like to
have follows:

1.  FERC Form 2s for the last three years
2.  Revenue breakdown:
   Assumptions made for the contracted period, as well as the time period
   beyond current contracts - firm/interruptible mix and volumes, tariffs
   for each type of transportation contract
   A build up from contracts to the revenues in the model would be ideal
3.  As before, compressor gas volumes and assumed sales prices for the
projected years
4.  As before, the story as it relates to CERA's view of the world
5.  Explicit calculation of rate base going forward
6.  Employee benefit plan information - funding status, return rates,
future liabilities

Thanks Rod.

"FW: Revised Memo to BU Coordinators","We are about to roll out a campaign to increase usage of the Sunrise financial data warehouse and at the same time address some of the reporting initiatives that came out of Rick's offsite in Galveston.  The goals of this effort are:

To promote usage of the financial data warehouse by both accounting and operational personnel, with the goal of training additional users as well as increasing the number of times our users access the warehouse. 

To identify and develop ""best practices"" reports and guidelines for accessing information in both the R/3 system and the data warehouse and to educate users as to the best solution for each reporting need.

To integrate the use of data warehouse reporting with existing SAP capabilities to relieve pressure on the SAP transaction system during peak periods.

As part of the data warehouse usage campaign, we will use various methods to most effectively reach the greatest number of users.  Those methods may include road shows and demos, articles in newsletters and on websites, and more individualized measures such as BU specific workshops and floor help sessions where data warehouse personnel are available to answer questions and help users become more comfortable using the data warehouse.  We want to tailor our campaign to each business unit's differing needs.

As we talk with the users in each group we believe we can gather information about best practices reports that are available and help to share this knowledge enterprise-wide.

In order to achieve these objectives prior to year end, we need your commitment and assistance.  You have been identified as your group's representative (BU advocate) to assist in accomplishing these goals.  Your responsibilities will be:

To assist in setting a strategic direction for improved reporting in each business unit through training, communication, new report development and knowledge sharing.

To provide assistance in the development and implementation of overall communications and training plans for each business unit to effectively reach the widest audience, including evaluation and recommendation of methods to encourage participation.  

To provide input into the development of a forum for knowledge sharing among the business units to encourage more effective use of all available reporting tools and to share ""best practices"" reports.

We expect there will be two meetings per month, and you will be our contact in setting up sessions for your group to communicate information such as best practices and guidelines as to which tools are most effective for which reporting needs.  We will also be asking you to review the listing of essential reports, key metrics and information needs that we have compiled from the Sunrise interviews last November and from the ISC's back-office review, to update this information in preparing the list of best practices reports. 

To thank you for your participation in this process, the Sunrise team will assist each of you in developing a new Business Objects report of your choice - best case, one that would replace a manual spreadsheet or otherwise help your group retrieve and report on data more effectively.

The successful completion of this campaign should result in more effective use of all available reporting tools and promote the development of a core user base to drive future development and improvements in the reporting area.  You as a BU advocate are a critical component to the success of this effort.  Here's the team:

	EA - Susan Helton, Director
	EES Wholesale - Mary Lynn Ruffer, Sr Director
	EEL - Michael Lyons, Sr Director
	EGM - Jeff Smith, Director
	EIM - Rainier Cockrell, Manager
	ENW - Allison Millan, Manager
	EBS - Paula Harris, Manager
	EES - Dana Lee, Director
	ETS - Jennifer Lev, Manager
	EGAS - Joanne Tran, Manager
	EEOS - Blake Walker, Manager
	Corp Acctg - Karen Choyce, Director
	EGF - Trisha Shannon, Director
	Corp Planning - Steve Schwarzbach, Director
	Corp Tax - Glenn Kobes, Director
	Corp HR - Terrie Wheeler, Director
	GSS - Bob Johansen, Director

Our introductory workshop will take place on October 31 from 10am-12noon in the 50th floor board room to formally begin this process (before close hits again).  This first meeting will focus on your perceptions as to why people in your group aren't using the data warehouse, and we will formulate action plans to address these issues.  Let me know if this time will not work for you.

If you have any questions, please give me a call at 33260.  Thanks for your help and support.

Messers Walters, Zahn, and McEllin are going to go back thru yr end audit workpaper files and pull those that (hopefully) support
balances or year to year variations for each line item of the audited income statement and balance sheet, and selected cash flow items. They will start w 2000vs1999 and work back from there. We intend to have an initial ""package"" within a week.

I would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully able to explain the trends on these sheets.   I would also like to begin to add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.   Accounting quite possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again.   This is not a project that will be complete by friday, but it does need to get complete this year.

"November Operational Storage Purchases","Stan,

In October we had a plan to purchase 0.5 Bcf of gas that was projected to bring our operational storage level to 12 Bcf by the end of the month and were concerned about over-filling our storage fields from potential long gas by shippers.  In reality, prices have risen and shippers have shorted the system by 1.7 Bcf month-to-date.  Our original plan, based on a combination of physical requirements and regulatory strategy was as follows:

Ending October Balance		12 Bcf
Ending November Balance		13 Bcf
Ending December Balance		14 Bcf

To acheive this plan we are projecting a purchase in November of at least 2.5 Bcf (depending upon shipper short gas over the remainder of the month).  We also expect to receive 0.3 Bcf of SBA imbalance payback in November that should raise the operational storage levels to approximately 13 Bcf.  We are still at risk for over-filling our storage fields in November and do not wish to buy any volumes that might push us over the 13 Bcf operational storage level.  Therefore, we are targeting the purchase of 2.5 Bcf of gas (which may be adjusted based on the customer's imbalances over the next week) for November.

Resume Review:
The Analyst/Associate group is currently collecting resumes from the University of Houston.  We will be holding a resume review session sometime this week to select the students who will be invited to interview with us next week.  Since there are several resumes to review, we will be needing your help in the selection process.  An email will be sent to you stating the time and place of the review session.

# of Interviewers/Greeters Needed:
On campus interviews will take place on Mon-Nov 12th and Tues-Nov 13th.  Until we determine the number of students that will be interviewing, we do not know the exact number of interviewers needed.  Therefore, we are estimating 8 Interviewers are needed for Day 1 and 4 for Day 2.  Since it is not uncommon for an interviewer to be unable to volunteer due to business reasons, we need to have an alternate list as well.  We would like to have 4 alternates for each day.

We only need 3 Greeters each day.

Below are those already listed to interview:			Below are those already listed to greet:

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

We have financial comparisions (income) to the most recent current estimate at that time, but not the original budget.
Also, NNG management reports are NOT legal entity, but are ""NNG Group"", which is inclusive of ENE's investment in Trailblazer and Overthrust.
Our only true legal entity financials are historical comparatives and only prepared quarterly and annually for noteholders, and annually for the FERC (Form2).

Rod I do not have Kelly Boots e-mail address and am traveling today without a phone directory... but I wanted to share or at least ask that we treat Standard Chartered real nice as we go through this crisis.  These guys are stepping up for us in every way....they (along with ING) are 100% behind us and are putting their money on it.  Also BNP Pays Bas is having an awful time with their credit committee...the business people have approved this and do not feel that Enron's problem effects us but the credit committee is not so forgiving.  If Kelly or anyone can do anything to help Paysbas in this situation it would be greatly appreciated.   My account executive there is Lincoln Payton and Marci Weiss...

Would you be so kind as to pass this along to Kelly or anyone else that you feel appropriate?

"Nutcracker Volunteer Opportunity"," 
Hi Rod,
 
First of all, I want to thank you for your participation on the Houston Ballet Board of Directors.  I hope that you are enjoying it.  
 
In addition to the table that we buy annually, we are also giving Houston Ballet $15,000.  In an effort to leverage that donation, the ballet is giving us 300 tickets to the Nutcracker matinee performance on Saturday, November 24th (the Saturday following Thanksgiving).  We will use 260 tickets for children involved with area non-profits, who might not have an opportunity to otherwise experience the Nutcracker.  The other 40 will be used for Enron employees who will volunteer to chaperone the children.  At noon of that day, we will have a pizza party at the Wortham with many of the Nutcracker characters walking around, meeting the children and reading to them.  Since you are involved with the ballet, we thought we'd see if you'd like to ask your team if they would like to be the volunteers.  Spouses and children (older than 14) are welcome to help, too!
 
Please let me know if this is something that your team would be interested in!  If so, we will take care of drafting an email to all of them on behalf of you.
 
Thanks so much,
Misha

Yes, it could happen that way if the Note Receivable would not be setup.  The establishment
of the Note generated the credit (reimbursement) to the project.

If the reimbursement doesn't show up then there is no offset and the dollars spent should end up in rate base.   Isn't that about the way it could happen?

Kevin,

I know you will find this hard to believe, but our Transaction Structure has changed once again.  We negotiated a new structure last night and I have put it on paper this morning.  Take a look and let me know if you have any questions.  I'm going to run this by Jeff and Mitch to get their confirmation and I'll let you know of any changes.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Enron Wind Aviation","

Adam / Stan,

I had a follow-up meeting with Gary Fitch regarding Enron Wind's aviation.  Gray indicated the following:

Aviation budget number look comparable to operator standards (approx. $1,900 / hour, 600 hour estimate)
The plane has a market value of $1.8 - $2.0 million and a book value of $2.2 million
Turbo prop charters for trips to Tehachapi would run in excess of $1,100 / hour and may be limited as there are only two qualified operators
The Cessna is the only jet suitable for use to Tehachapi based on runway length and altitude
Gary will make a site visit before the end of the year

Assuming that of the budgeted 600 hours of operation, only 400 hours would require charter, the cost of charter would approach $0.5 million of the total budget of $1.2 million.  This plus the flexibility of using the plan on longer hauls (e.g., to Houston) make it economically justified.

My recommendation is that based on the current situation, we retain the aircraft.

Tod

Subject:	Confidential - GSS Organization Value to ETS


Here are my thoughts on the value the GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) brings to ETS:

I believe totally in the concept of strategically sourcing our materials and services for ETS, which is the concept that GSS was founded under, while still within the ETS organization.  Basically the value that GSS has brought to the bottom line during the last year has been minimal to ETS.   The reasons for that statement, in my opinion, are:

The materials and services that ETS purchase are basic and routine.
Most of those materials and service providers were identified and sourced during 1999 and 2000.
ETS is reaching the point where we need fewer providers, not more.
New items identified are normally rolled into one of our already sourced NPA's.
Almost all large dollar items are bid out (three bids and a buy).
GSS's involvement and commitment to the deal ends with the contract signing.
ETS P&SM organization and our Contracts services group deals with the actual execution and the ringing of the cash register.


If the GSS organization went away tomorrow, we would need the following expertise brought over from their group: (currently this group is close to 75 people.)(and very highly paid individuals)

Two (2) negotiators - Contract Managers
Two (2) analysts
Two (2) contract administrators

The administration of the following services would need to be shifted to the ISC:

iBuyit System
Catalog system (part of iBuyit)
iPayit system

We would need to re-assess the value of the contract with SourceNet and whether we continue down that path or implement our own A/P department.   This would take very few staff adds to make that happen.

Let me know if you need any further detail.

I will email to you this list sometime early tomorrow.  My comment on materiality goes to such items as ALL contracts (big or small), ALL minutes from BOD meetings from inception, ALL vehicle information, just to name a few.

Kevin,

Rather than set a materiality scope at this point, lets focus on certain
sections for our meeting on Thursday.   I hope that this will reduce the
burden of gathering data and people for the meeting.

I think we should use our time on Thursday to cover:
   Operations
   Financial
   Accounting
   Regulatory
   Environmental

Please let me know if this works for you.

Attached is a red line version of the previous due diligence list sent with
a few updates.

If you have any questions, please give me a call (713/767-4764).

Kyle

Shawn:

Attached is a preliminary definition of social risk - let me know if it is not clear or needs to be further defined.  

I thought you might be interested in the attached link to the UK's Institute of Internal Auditors magazine.  There are several articles discussing social/environmental/reputation risk and role of the internal auditor.   <http://www.iia.org.uk/knowledge/magart01.html>

Thanks again for your help on this!

Regards, 

Lauren




Social Risk: the risk associated with direct and/or indirect impacts of a company's business decisions and practices, business partnerships, products and services on its stakeholders and the communities where it operates.  

Specific social risks that can impact one's ability to achieve business objectives include: child labor, security arrangements, indigenous land rights,  labor rights, child labor, forced labor corruption, boycotts, shareholder resolutions, environmental justice, proactive dialogue and engagement with stakeholders (or lack of), freedom of speech, corporal punishment, public health

Stakeholder is defined as any individual, group, or organization able to affect, be affected by, or that believes it might be affected by, a decision or activity. This can include employees, activists, communities, indigenous populations, government, customers, investors 


To provide an example - see below
Business Activity									Social Risk
Business venture with government entity associated with repressive regime	Forced labor, pension fund divestiture, NGO campaign, lawsuits
Operating in area of conflict								Security arrangements, sanctions
Equity position in pulp, mining sector							Indigenous land rights and compensation, migrant labor issues
Trading commodities with counterparties						Ethical business practices and association of counterparties 
										
Below is not an exhaustive list 
Social risk can be assessed by:
Identifying and analyzing a corporation, business unit or project's stakeholders and their concerns
Identifying  and analyzing the scope and level of influence that stakeholders can have on the objectives of the business and/or project
Including social assessment in due diligence and the environmental impact assessment
Identifying the lifecycle and impacts of a product or service or business decision on the communities and environment where the business activity occurs. 

Social Risk can be managed by: 
Establishing, disseminating and enforcing policies and procedures addressing human rights and environmental issues
Training managers to identify social/environmental risk
Establishing and implementing strategy for mitigating social and environmental impacts
Developing a stakeholder engagement strategy
Designating department/manager to manage social and environmental issues
Auditing facilities against set policies and procedures

Subject: EEI an economic Stimulus Package
Importance: High



As you know the House has passed their economic stimulus package.  This contains a deduction of 30% in the first year for property placed in service after September 10, 2001 and before December 31, 2004.  EEI convened a meeting late last week to see if other industries had a problem similar to theirs; i.e., that most of their property additions take a longer time to build.   They also would like to see repair and replacement of their property included as this also promotes jobs.

Enclosed is a proposed amendment by EEI along with a explanatory position paper. <<expensechanges to section 101.rtf>>   <<expensingcorrec2.DOC>> 

They want to know if other associations, such as INGAA, have a similar problem and would support such a change.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW PRIOR TO 12:30 PM ON THURSDAY IF YOU NEED THIS CHANGE.  I WILL BE ATTENDING A MEETING AT EEI.  THANKS.

I would also like to discuss the top 3-5 concerns you have for your business and your people.   You should decide if there are people in your organization that are needed to discuss basic functions of Planning, Accounting, Finance and Tax and feel free to include them in this process, but I would like to keep the group to Director level or above.

still waiting for the formal pubcomps and acqcomps from JPMorgan and SSB.  I spent years in NY doing the math though and spoke to Rod for his help (he had great color).  The answer is 8-10x ebitda.  as an extra check, we put in another multiple for the duke/westcoast deal (approx. 1.7x rate base).  Same answer both times.  EV 2.0-2.3 (with a sales hat maybe 2.5), equity value 1.6-1.8.  I wouldnt push the sales hat too far though, the duration of contracts on this pipeline do not favorably compare to those on most pipelines in general -- in other words, you could be staring at a ""hole"" in '04.  

(Once I get the precise numbers from the bankers, I'll plug them in -- the answer shouldnt change more than 5%).  What's the next step for me?  Want me to forward to muller/jeff golden?

I have twice emailed Sally Beck, the signatory on the last agreements signed by ENA, with NNG and TW, to see if she could give me a lead on whom to contact.  I also left her a voice mail.  She has not responded.   We cannot proceed with the Northern Border implementation without a confidentiality agreement between ENA and NBP.  

Caminus is still looking to set up a meeting for gathering requirements for both NBP and possibly the Risk Analytics package.

Sally,

In March of 1999, ETS companies, Northern Natural Gas (NNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (TW), signed Confidentiality Agreements with Enron Capital and Trade (ECT) for pricing information.  You were the signatory for ECT at that time.  These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes.  Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.  However, the Confidentiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any other companies.  I would appreciate any assistance you could provide in identifying the new person at ENA/EWS that would handle these duties currently.

Thanks

Lisa, 

Attached is the Spend/Approvals amounts for the new HR job groups that have recently been created and the most recent HR structure file that I received from Lessa Hutcherson in HR.  I inserted in red the Spend/Approval amounts that we discussed for the new groups.  Currently we have no employees in any of these new groups.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks 

Jeff

"FW: Transwestern Fair Value","Fair Value is applied to plant and is being amortized over a useful life. 
TW Fair Value is very similar to Goodwill in that it represents an excess over book value, and is not formally being recoverd in rates; BUT at the time of the  acquistion it was treated as a purchase price allocation an applied to plant. Goodwill is meant to be a ""leftover"" after all costs have been allocated.

"NEPCO Cash","Rod,

We need to make sure Enron Treasury understands the $300 million plus of NEPCO cash will have to flow back in the next year.  I have been involved in two situations where some smart people in the treasury functions did not really understand this impact. There is more cash to come from the projects, but for the most part that represents the profits and that cash will not really be ours until we have cleared the retainages and LOC's. If we can get a couple of new projects in NEPCO, we might be able to sustain the balance, but nothing is secure at this time.

"NNG Revenues/Margins for 2003 and 2004","

Per your request,

Attached is the slide we reviewed with Danny today.  It shows the value of contract terminations for NNG for the contract year of 1101/03 to 11/01/04 to be $145 million. It also shows that the estimated market value is $95 million.  I think for planning purposes however, we would assume that we would contract for the full value of $145 million either through better pricing analytics, new business development projects and/ or Rate Case reallocation to captive customers.  The biggest risk would be the South end TFF of $12 million which we would have a hard time replacing at a $3 million level.



 


So, depending on your assumptions, 2003 and 2004 could be flat to 2002 margin of $439.1 million -   or, if you take into account  the TFF deterioration, it could be below by $8 to 10 million.  However, this deterioration will be offset by some of the new power plant projects  - in particular ""Pleasant Hill""  which will bring an incremental $6 million in 2004.  I think you also have to assume that other business development projects will come in to help offset the downsides.

Sorry if I rambled a bit too much.  My view is that NNG will have margin targets for planning purposes flat with 2002.  

Call me if you wish to discuss.

John,
We need to be prepared to communicate to ETS about plans for the phased-in move to Bryan-College Station, call center and transaction processors this December and everyone else next December.

	Call center hot link
	Staff turnover and retraining
	Drain of management expertise
	Re-mailing to vendors (the first mailing created so much noise I though we would lose our jobs over it)

This will surely come up on next Friday's meeting if anyone from ETS is there.

Judy

"Insurance Difficulties","Rod,

As I understand it from the last staff meeting we had, you are taking the lead (for Stan's group of businesses) in dealing with the many insurance issues we have.  I want to add to the list as follows:

-	Panama:  after many months of work with the CPA and adjuster on a claim of approximately $3.5 million, we are still waiting to receive an advance payment of $1.5 	million which was recommended by the adjuster.  The underwriter is simply using delay tactics.  I understand from my team that the overwhelming conclusion is that 	this will take at least initiating a legal procedure.  

-	Dominican Republic: steam turbine claim of approximately $16 million.  This claim has been sitting with HSB for months.  HSB has simply refused to recognize any    	of the BI beyond the 90 day deductible.  Several meetings/conference calls have taken place and our view is that we will have to apply high leve pressure (potentially 	using Ken Lay's relationship with AIG) or pursue them legally if we want anything to happen  in the near future.  Unfortunately, it appears that due to the absence of a 	cut-through clause we would have to pursue them in DR courts through the fronting company.  On top of all this, in securing this year's insurance coverage (which as 	you know was allowed to expire without notice), we asked that the cut through clause be dealt with this time around (apparently, this was something that was 	pursued last year and didn't get done).  We have made the payment of the policy and after being told that the insurer (verbally) approved the cut through, now it 	appears that is no longer the case!  To top it all off, it looks like we have lost 5% of our underwriting coverage.  In short, we are about to go to litigation on a $16 	million claim against HSB; our current policy still lacks a cut through clause, and we have lost 5% of our underwriting coverage.  SECLP can hardly afford these 	types of problems.

-	Nicaragua: the situation there hasn't changed much.  We are being asked to pay $1.2 million (for a 70 MW project!) with a deductible of $5 million for physical 	damage and 90 days for BI.  Essentially no coverage for a project of this size.  We are told we should be very happy (!) to be able to have the possibiilty of securing 	this, which, by the way, hasn't even been fully secured.  Note that this is adding one more plant (with a fairly clean loss record) to the existing Enron umbrella.  	Finally, although at the beginning we were told that we could cancel at any time with the only cost being the pro-rata portion of the annual premium, now, upon our 	very clear request for confirmation of such right, we have yet to receive same.

I wanted to make sure that you had this information as we attempt to find solutions to our insurance problems.  

Thanks

Subject:	2002 IM Structure

Tracy, as the ETS overall planner, the Property Accounting Users Group requests that you instruct the ISC to roll over the current IM structure for 2002 for both ETS Consolidated and ETS Un-Consolidated.  This will allow for the setting up of 2002 projects (to be saved they must be attached to a 2002 Budget code)  and when the 2002 capital budget is approved, allow for the inputting of the 2002 budget.  No transfer of dollars is involved in the roll over.  This is strictly a structure roll over.   

Please email Marian Bryant with the ISC the approval for the roll over and the date you would like for this to happen.  The Users group is recommending for this to be done November 1st.   If you have specific questions or concerns, please contact Marian directly, x55944.

	I am dropping you this e-mail at the request of Rod Hayslett and in response to your voice mail message to him concerning the status of the price redetermination under the LNG contract with Duke.  The parties reached settlement on this issue about a week before arbitration.  The new price beginning September 1 is 92.5% of the Equivalent MMBtu Price of No. 6 Fuel Oil less $0.25 per

We expect to hear something on tues in regard to the extension of 2 weeks but will probably not know about the final fix until the 2nd week of dec

Why would we not sell the units even if the proceeds are trapped in rawhide as it would allow us to pay down debt ?

I agree that we do not want to announce anything publically until we understand where we are as it could hurt our bargaining position

Subject:	Pollution Liability Runoff Coverage

As requested we have amended the quote for pollution runoff coverage.   Attached is a spreadsheet reflecting the two options you wanted to consider.

  
Option 1 - For the extension of the existing coverages for the 40 month period  - AIG quoted $340,000

Option 2- (48 month new PPL run-off  policy including products)
AIG has agreed to the price of $509,000 with a deductible of $100,000 for all claims except products liability which carries a $1Million deductible.  The $509,000 will be credited with a $85,000 pro rata premium refund from the current policy for a toal owed of $424,000.

The premium difference betwen the extension of the current policy with limited coverage (Option 1) to the new expanded coverage version  (Option 2) is $84,000

It is Risk Managements recommendation that Azurix go with Option 2 for the broader coverage.

"Consultant's view on gas transmission into California","Rod:

As we discussed here are the bulletts that summarize what we heard from our
consultants.

Overall demand picture

Believe it will be 2006 before the California market will get back to
2000/2001 demand levels

          2002           demand down approximately 900 mmcf/d
          2003      demand will be flat
          2004      growth in demand will begin
          2005-2006 return to 2001 demand levels

Reasoning:

   2001 was a dry year - the lack of hydro generation created an additional
   600 mmcf/d demand for gas in California
   Anticipated generation capacity overbuild in California - new more
   efficient power plants with better heat rates will displace older gas
   fired generation, reducing the amount of gas required to generate a MW
   of electricity on the margin
   California electricity rate increases have curtailed demand for power
   and subsequently, gas

Gas transmission capacity into the state

Over the next two to three years there will be an additional 2.0 Bcf/d of
transmission capacity into California

   800 mmcf/d in 2002
   900 mmcf/d in 2003 (Kern River expansion)
   300 mmcf/d                 (El Paso conversion of All American oil line
   and power up)

San Juan basin gas

San Juan basin production is declining

   first half of 2001 vs. first half of 2000 production off by
   approximately 200 mmcf/d
   Rockies gas will not replace declining production in the San Juan
   San Juan gas will move closer to Permian pricing



The consultants believe that the combination of these factors will put
decontracting pressure on existing transmission into the state of
California, and especially the El Paso and Transwestern lines.

However, the ""wild card"" in their view is unforeseen California power
demand growth.

As we discussed, JPMorgan would like to hear your views on the above
issues.

Please give me a call when you have had sufficient time to digest and we
can set up a conference call to make the most efficient use of your time.

Thanks Rod

Brent

Also, when you have had a chance to look at sales gas volume growth please
e-mail the volume numbers to me...thanks

In light of the recent events, can we still attend the event at the Kayenta Boys & Girls Club?  This is the event that Senator McCain my be at and that we will be invited to make some remarks.  Lou also mentioned that it might be something for Stan to go to.

What do you think?

Subject: FERC Contact Re:  Enron Situation Impact on Pipelines

I received a call from Jim Guest at the FERC OCA this afternoon concerning the Enron situation.  He had read the articles and heard the reports.  Wanted to know if bad accounting was the root of the problem.  I advised him that it was bad investments that was the real issue. He asked about the use of the pipeline assets to pull Enron thru the liquidity crisis.  I gave him a brief overview of the Dynegy cash infusion and the bank revolvers.  He said there was some concern at the FERC that projects we might be proposing may not be able to be funded due to the reduced ability of the pipelines to obtain outside financing due to the securitization of the all the assets.  I indicated that it was my opinion that good investments in pipeline facilities would probably be looked on favorably at Enron these days.

Thought you'd want a quick update.  I haven't advised Drew or Greg Porter yet.  Thought you might want to cover with them.

Subject: Toll Model Review Meeting Updates



The model review meeting on Thursday went well, and the consensus was that there are many changes to be made to the current Foothills economic model. Many assumptions in the current model were challenged by the participant companies. Foothills agreed to reflect the suggested changes to the model (Andy is supposed to send out a summary of the discussion) and provided an electronic copy of the model for withdrawn partners' review. Withdrawn partners agreed to give their comments/feedback on the model to Foothills until 11/27/01 and another meeting to reach an agreement on economic model/toll was scheduled for 12/03/01 or 12/04/01. The data from economic/toll model will be used in commercial proposal/presentation to the ANS producers which ANNGTC intends to have by 12/20/01. Tim and I will review Foothills' cash flow and COS model and prepare comments.

Overall, the participants though that the current Foothills model ($0.43/MMBtu toll for Alaska section) has very aggressive assumptions in many ways, and it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after all the appropriate revisions are made. The following are the main discussion points of the meeting. Item 1 and 2 are expected to have a very large impact on the toll.

1) Capex and Opex need to have annual/monthly escalation (current model has 0% escalation). For example, Foothills sensitivity analysis shows that 2.5% Capex escalation would increase the toll by $0.20. Numbers such as 1.5% for Capex and 2.5% for Opex were thrown during the meeting, but more reviews need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates. Do you have any opinion on this, Bryan?

2) Foothills is using Flowthrough method (using cash taxes in COS calculation) to calculate income taxes that go into the Cost of Service and might be underestimating Cost of Service. Tim thought that the Flowthrough method will not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed by IRS and FERC. Foothills said that they can still have same toll under Normalized tax method by changing the depreciation number, but Tim was concerned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation. Foothills declined our request to share their Cost of Service model and insisted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the cash flow model. They agreed to provide a hard copy of their Cost of Service model in the end, but Tim and I were under impression that Foothills was trying to lower the toll as much as they can. Tim was also concerned about levelized toll approach because of FERC might lower allowed return in the later rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this. Please correct me if I am wrong here, Tim.

3) OM & A is currently estimated to be 1% of Capex but this might be too low (OM&A in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx. 1.5% of total Capex).

4) The Withdrawn Partners' historical contributions ($228 million) will be added to the Rate Base, but this might be dropped if necessary. Success fee of $40 million should be included in the project budget.

5) Working Capital will be added to the project cost. The Line Pack cost (14.5 Bcf for the whole section) was assumed to be borne by ANS producers but some participants highly doubted that that would be the case. The Line Pack gas might have to be bought by the Partnership or the Producers will at least demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for 25 years.

6) For Return on Capital and AFUDC, 14% ROE and 8% Interest on Debt assuming 30/70 capital structure is likely to be kept. However, the current drawdown schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginning, which will not be true. Certain assumptions should be made on the financial close date and commercial agreement/preliminary determination date to calculate AFUDC more accurately.

7) Current financing assumption in the model is a 25 year bank loan with balloon amortization and DSCR of 1.6. In reality, the initial bank loans will be of shorter maturity (5-15 years) and certain roll-over financing will be unavoidable. It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches with different terms, interest rate, seniority etc. 

8) There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of the ANGTS considering that some sources of capital, revenues and part of operating expenses will be in Canadian dollars. A mechanis to mitigate currency risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it.

9) Property taxes of 2% in Alaska seems high, but Property taxes during construction period should be added. 

Lastly, there is about $300 million difference ($4,336-$4035) between ETS current cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model, excluding IDC and AFUDC. Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for larger pipe size (46 or 48 inch) as noted in Bryan's email.  

Thanks,

"FW: furniture purchase","Rod - The furniture that David is interesting in purchasing was acquired by Enron International a couple of years ago.  So... It's now your asset.  We have made him a fair offer.  You would get the cash proceeds.  Do you want our office to negotiate or is it a take it or leave it deal.  This is very good quality stuff but way off standard from what we expect to use in future.  Also... we think we'll have plenty of executive furniture to keep in stock for future use, i.e. these pieces can be considered surplus.  Your thoughts - Bill

Bill Donovan has been made aware of this pricing structure for your furniture. The pricing offered you represents 
the discounting structure available to executives leaving Enron for furniture purchases.  Feel free
to contact Mr. Donovan to discuss this matter further.  As we discussed, I believe your offer of $300

Bill, I have proposed below pricing for the furniture that  I would be more comfortable with, given it will be separated from the Enron built in decor and dimensions it was designed to integrate with. This particularly affects the desk, which is very nice but drawerless and designed to work together with the wall unit that sits behind it. The ""credenza w/tamboor"" is built in to the wall to fit the specific dimensions of that space and probably should be kept in the office. Also, I noticed that my desk chair was not on the list, perhaps because it is older. I would propose $300.

7) Current financing assumption in the model is a 25 year bank loan with balloon amortization and DSCR of 1.6. In reality, the initial bank loans will be of shorter maturity (5-15 years) and certain roll-over financing will be unavoidable. It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches with different terms, interest rate, seniority etc. 

8) There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of the ANGTS considering that some sources of capital, revenues and part of operating expenses will be in Canadian dollars. A mechanis to mitigate currency risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it.

9) Property taxes of 2% in Alaska seems high, but Property taxes during construction period should be added.

Lastly, there is about $300 million difference ($4,336-$4035) between ETS current cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model, excluding IDC and AFUDC. Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for larger pipe size (46 or 48 inch) as noted in Bryan's email.

Hello Rod,

In the audited financials, there are footnotes that explain some of the environmental liabilities.  Is this what you referred to when you asked if I had the disclosures?  If not, is this a separate document that I need to have for the ""data room?""

Thank you,

"Immediate support","Dear Rod:

Sorry we could not touch base today.  I know you are swamped with the current situation.  Several of us have helped companies work through crises like this over the past twenty years. We understand Enron's need for exceptionally fast action.

We have the crisis management expertise and I offer you our full and complete support in this time of need.  Mark, Paul and myself have been contributors to successful crisis interventions involving such companies as IBM, Texaco, Humana Hospitals, Texas Instruments, Hospital Corporation of America, Lucent Technologies, Atlanta Scientific, Honeywell, 3M, Phillips Petroleum Company?.  Rod, we are at your service immediately.
  
We know that in Enron's current crisis, you cannot:
?	Grow fast enough to make a positive difference 
?	Sell assets fast enough to make a positive difference
?	Move fast enough into a major cost cutting program and reorganization of assets to generate the cash and credibility to needed to appease Wall Street 
?	Aggressively communicate and perform those needed actions fast enough to regain support from Wall Street.

Due to the significance of this situation, we know that Enron would benefit greatly by reducing cost this week by 5-7 percent, with an additional 5-7 percent reduction next week, followed by an additional 5-7 percent over the next month - all while you and the leadership team continue to manage the external crisis.  This will get you the positive story and operating earnings needed to begin reestablishing your market position.  These are hard times and these unbearably hard decisions and their public announcement need to take place quickly.  

We offer to help you and the leadership team:
?	Speed the achievement of large scale cost reductions
?	Quickly shore-up your most pressured areas of exposure
?	Create the ""operations"" success story for Wall Street, investors, partnerships and employees
?	Provide options for impending scenarios not yet encountered

Call me today at #33034 or I will give you a call in the morning to follow-up.  We want to help you make a positive difference.  

Sincerely,

Bill Rutherford

We have four ports reserved.  The Omaha participants will meet in Conference Room 456.  I'm assuming the Houston attendees will gather in one location.  If this is not correct, please let me know so we can add additional ports.

NOTE TO GREEK:  Do you plan to dial in from a remote location?  

It is very important that we have enough ports reserved.  I would appreciate everyone's efforts in providing me with the information I need to insure that we have sufficient capability to conduct this teleconference.

I took the liberty of summarizing my 14 1/2 years of work at Enron.  Either you can use it in your discussions with Andy or I can (if we feel it becomes necessary).  I get the sense that Andy (and Ben for that matter) may have lost sight of my contributions to the company.  I thought this might help clear up a few things.  I was a little ""fuzzy"" pre-1992!

"Contact with Jacob's Engineering re: NEPCO","Dick Lydecker and I had a conversation today (Monday, Oct. 22) with Noel Watson, the Chairman and CEO of Jacobs, concerning interest in NEPCO. Noel had been out of the office most of last week due to the death of his mother in law.  

We discussed the potential of Jacobs acquiring NEPCO over a period of time. Noel listened, but it was difficult to determine his interest. We outlined a program where Jacobs, after a confidentiality agreement is in place, would send a couple of people to meet with Dick and I for a one day summary review of NEPCO. If there is interest from that review, then we would proceed to a management introduction and due diligence.  Noel stated he would keep our approach in confidence, but needed to review the opportunity with a couple of people and would get back to us next Monday, Oct. 29.  From past experience, I know Joe Jacobs, the founder, will be involved in any acquisition decision and I am sure that is the focus of Noel's review. I am sure Noel will also test his sources on NEPCO.

In a side note, Jacobs shares have been doing very well as of late and are almost back to their historic high.

***************************************

Social Studies: Some Useful Definitions

Feudalism
You have two cows.
Your lord takes some of the milk.

Fascism
You have two cows.
The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and
sells you the milk.

Applied Communism
You have two cows.
You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.

Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows.
You sell them and retire on the income

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more. - No Balance Sheet provided with the release.

"RE: FERC/INGAA Accounting Liaison Meeting Agenda","DRAFT -FOR DISCUSSION ONLY.

Lynn, 
(Please consider for inclusion but only if Mr. Gruber, Mr. Bacile, Mr. Hayslett, and Mr. Harris
concur)

Possible topics:

1. What is FERC's accounting position on the Exposure Draft related to Accounting for Certain Activities Related to Property, Plant, and Equipment, and is the FERC going to author a formal comment?

2. With increased emphasis and regulation related to pipeline safety and integrity, it appears that a number of companies in the industry are embarking on significant programs to throughly test their systems. A significant aspect of a program of this nature is smart pigging and hydrostatic testing. What is the FERC's accounting position on possible capitalization of these costs? 

3. Of recent, the FASB has issued new rules, ie., SFAS 142 on Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and SFAS 143  - Asset Retirement Obligations. Is the FERC going to issue regulatory accounting guidance on these new rules?

4. ""GAAP""-""RAP"" differences has for some time been a informal topic of discussion. With increased FASB rulemaking activity this risk may be increasing. Since ""RAP"" is mandated by Federal Law has the FERC have any concerns that pipeline application of ""GAAP"" that may be deemed, at variance to ""RAP"" may also be violation of federal law? (ie., #1 above, and levelized rate making accounting, approved in rate settlements, but not ""approved"" for GAAP)

	Paul,

	The Methanol Plant was shutdown during August of this year due to poor economics.  The following is a list of steps 	taken to prepare the plant for this outage:


	Lines and vessels have been purged and are mostly open to the atmosphere.
	Lubricating oils have been drained from equipment, ""large oil systems"" (e.g. syn gas and recycle compressor lube 	systems) have been soap washed.
	Oily water sewer and separation vessels have been washed with soap.
	Chemical storage vessels have been cleaned out or removed from the plant.
	Cooling tower wooden structures have been demolished and removed from the site.
	Industrial gases (e.g. calibration, welding, etc.) have been removed from the plant.
	Natural gas and oxygen lines to the facility have been blinded at the battery limits.
	All catalyst and resins have been removed from the plant.
	All firefighting equipment (e.g. fire water, monitors, extinguishers, foam, foam truck, etc.) remain in the facility 	and are serviceable.
	LEL monitoring equipment and the Whalen alarm system remain in service and are serviceable.
	Provisions are being made for necessary periodic inspection of fire extinguishers. (Should LEL test, alarm test, 	monitor inspection, be included?)
	Electrical power will remain to all facilities and will be serviceable.
	All current utilities to the Tank Farm/Barge Loading Facilities will remain and will be serviceable.
	The process area will be secured by a six foot high chain link fence with 20' wide gates on each side at drive in 	points.  The gates will be locked.
 	The oxygen compressor located in Sunoco area will be secured by a six foot high chain link fence with one pedestrian 	gate (locked).
	Pipe racks on the north boundary of the plant will be within the security fence, pipe racks on the west boundary will 	be outside the security fence.
	Admin and analyzer buildings will be locked and HVAC systems turned off.
	The warehouse will continue to house a reduced level of inventory with HVAC system in service.
	
	Please let me know if you need any additional information regarding the latest outage of the Methanol plant.

	Thanks,
		Tom   713-993-5604

Paul,

Further to our discussion on 10/03/01, we understand that Tom Meers is
looking at providing additional information regarding the above.
Specifically, he is to provide a report advising Enron's plans for this
facility including the details of the ""shut down"" process, maintenance of
the facility, security at the site, etc. This information will be provided
to Enron Corp Property Package underwriters when received. Our current
understanding is that the facility has not been operating for the past 30
days and is preparing for a longer term shut down phase. We further
understand from our conversation that Enron is clearing the product streams
from the system and that the plant is currently ""hydrocarbon free"" thus
eliminating a substantial portion of the facility fire hazards. Also, we
understand that the tank farm and control building will continue to operate.
Enron is maintaining front gate security and is considering a separate
fencing around the process area.

Paul, we look forward to receiving the report as requested. Please advise
status.

Thanks and regards,

David Huckabay

"Quick Note","Stan,

Knowing that your schedule is tight, I wanted to drop you a not on two items;

1) I have had a couple discussions with Rod on the finance/accounting organization for Wind.  I understand that Adam is pushing for a new full-time CFO including a CFO for Europe.  Being open, Adam and I have different views on the direction of the organization.  My view is that many functions should be supported by the Enron infrastructure (including treasury, cash-management, insurance, IT, etc.).  Adam would prefer to stay autonomous and is attempting to direct initiatives to that end.  I continue to push the organization in the course that I believe makes most sense.  While we are both professionals, this situation does create a conflict.  In my opinion, the most serious issues in this business are not financial, they are operational and commercial.  I'll continue to work with Rod, but would be glad to discuss with you in further detail.

2) I understand that Steve Hotte is transferring to Wholesale and you are looking at several candidates.  I would like to offer you input on two candidates that I have had considerable experience with.  Both are worthy of serious consideration, and both capable of meeting your needs.

Everett Plante - I recruited Everett into Enron from a fairly high position at Compaq.  Initially he was in Enron International.  After the dissolution of EI he rolled into corporate for a short time, subsequently, I helped get him moved into EBS.  He was thought of very highly.  He has great organization skill and a practical view on technology.  He has been through several organizations since coming to Enron and he has adeptly dealt with change.

Andrew Parsons - Andrew has worked for me on Y2K and in his current role in IT Compliance.  Andrew has great interpersonal and teamwork skills.  He is very focused and goal oriented.  Andrew is currently a Sr. Director, but will be up for VP at yearend.  While not as experienced as Everett, Andrew has a lot of potential.  I know that Causey also thinks highly of Andrew.

Tod

PS -  I am always open to buying lunch.

Subject: Improtant: Social and Environmental Risk baseline


As part of Ken Lays initiative to measure Enron's social and environmental risk, EAS has been requested to help with a baseline assessment of what our BU's are doing in those areas.  As such, please talk with your CAO's and/or BU leaders as part of your 2002 risk assessment and obtain answers to the following questions and send them back to me on or before Thanksgiving.  Please let me know if you're having any problems with this or need further clarification.


* Do the business units know the scope and nature of social and environmental risks associated with their business strategy, transactions, assets, countries where they operate, and/or counter parties? 
* Do the business units have a process to identify social and environmental risk?
* If so, what process does the business units employ in order to identify and manage social and environmental risk?
* What process do the business units use to quantify and/or qualify these exposures?
* Who is responsible for managing this process in the business?  
* Does the business review the quality of their social/environmental risk assessment and management activities?
* Is the business unit aware of the existing corporate function and processes?

This information will help Ken and his task team to  develop a proposed process for developing a consistent process for measuring social/environmental risk management performance across the business.  We may be asked for more assistance in this area in 2002.

Thank you for your assistance!

Shawn

She has not responded.   We cannot proceed with the Northern Border implementation without a confidentiality agreement between ENA and NBP.  

Caminus is still looking to set up a meeting for gathering requirements for both NBP and possibly the Risk Analytics package.

Sally,

In March of 1999, ETS companies, Northern Natural Gas (NNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (TW), signed Confidentiality Agreements with Enron Capital and Trade (ECT) for pricing information.  You were the signatory for ECT at that time.  These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes.  Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.  However, the Confidentiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any other companies.  I would appreciate any assistance you could provide in identifying the new person at ENA/EWS that would handle these duties currently.

Thanks

"FW: Phase 6 Comparison:  Plan vs Dave Analysis","
Please see the attached comparison of the Phase 6 that we have in the 2002-2006 Plan versus Dave's analysis.

For the Plan, we ran it with and without Phase 6 to determine the incremental change.  The worksheet attached also shows the Returns on Equity and Capitalization (with and without) based on the Plan runs.

You will have a reasonable apples-to-apples if you compare the amounts at the Operating Income level because Dave did not assume how it was financed in his analysis however my depreciation is GAAP but Dave's is Tax.

There are only two significant differences:

1)  For conservatism, Dave used the settled rate rather than the rate refund floor rate in 2004.  In Dave's calculations this made a difference of  about 2.9 cents (77.60 cts vs. 74.71 cts. ) for the customers other than FP&L in 2004.  There is no difference for FP&L because their 2004 rate cap is 74.60 cts, lower than either the settled or rate refund floor rates.  (Per Dave, in the risk analyses the rate refund floor impact WAS included.)

2)  We got a lower Ad Valorem tax estimate from Ted Ryan than what Dave used.

I have left a voice mail this morning for Rod asking if you guys already have some documentation that would suffice for this matter.

Any help you can give is greatly appreciated.  This is going to come up many more times before the end of the year gets here.  Jessie Mata already has three more EOTT LC's on her desk to be processed once we get more capacity.

"Enron Fleet Council Recommendations VS Reality","As a member of the Enron Fleet Council, I wish to advise management of the following facts. 

Enron Fleet Council Members:
Members			BU			Manufacturer Purchased	Number
Bruce Martin - Cheri		ETS - EOTT		DaimlerChrysler			200
Cheri Sublet			ETS/EFS		Ford					160
Randy Hardenbrook 		Wind			Ford and DaimlerChrysler		  50
Jeddy Beasley			PGE			GM					  10
													420
As you are aware, Enron realizes savings each year by stacking volumes with the manufacturer's.  ETS and EFS will realize reduced costs by stacking volumes with the manufacturer's during 2002.  Listed below is a breakdown of the difference in costs by manufacturer:

If we purchased GM rather than DaimlerChrysler, ETS would pay an additional $524,000 for the same number of vehicles.
If we purchased Ford rather than DaimlerChrysler, ETS would pay an additional $1,036,748 for the same number of vehicles.

Enron Facility Service
As indicated above, EFS will only allow the purchase of Ford's for their business unit.  Because they also require most vehicles to be purchased as an emergency, they pay $2,000 to $3,000 per vehicle for ""off the lot"" purchases.  Because EFS has made a decision to only purchase Ford, their business unit will pay an additional $950,000 to purchase the same number of Fords vs Dodges.  I realize this is a business unit decision, but their choice effects Enron's bottom line.  In addition to increased costs to EFS, all Enron business units suffer due to the reduction in stacked volumes with one manufacturer.  

Enron Wind
Wind acquires vehicles utilizing a local Ford dealership in California.  Although Wind has participated in the Enron Fleet Council and  in some cases, followed the recommendations of the council, their major annual purchase is from Ford.

PGE
PGE is not an active participant in the Enron Fleet Council.  Although they participated in past years, have always chosen to purchase GM.  Their spend is relatively low, but effects the total units purchased within Enron.  

Maintenance
Both PGE and Enron Wind utilize Enron staffed maintenance facilities.  Although the Enron Fleet Council and prior strategic sourcing efforts have pointed out the high cost of these maintenance shops, little has been done toward outsourcing the light duty maintenance.  (oil changes, minor maintenance, tune-ups and tire repair)  

Because Enron is now organized under EGS, we have an opportunity to support the recommendations of the Enron Fleet Council.  As you are aware, the council recommended purchasing vehicles based upon the manufacturer's incentives and stacking volumes based on total Enron purchases.  We only requested incentives from the manufacturers based on the 300 level because we have such a split of purchasing practices across the business units.  Rather than the 300 level, we would be looking at 450 to 500 with even greater incentives.  

We have an opportunity to reduce Enron's overall fleet costs by making a decision to utilize one manufacturer, rather than splitting the purchases between all three manufacturer's.  Because we are now organized under one CFO within Enron Global Services, this may be an opportunity to guide all Enron business units to take advantage of our purchasing power.

This recommendation will be challenged by some business units, but under these challenging times within Enron, any savings in our costs effects the bottom line.  The Enron Fleet Council will collectively offer additional savings based on sound fleet practices, during the next few weeks.   

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call.

"FW: Deconsolidation of Dabhol if Enron's shares are increased to 65%","
FYI -

Bechtel has requested that the agenda for the DPC board meeting next week include a vote to issue the Phase II shares.  Once the shares are issued, Enron will have 65% voting rights and will be able to control the matters which require majority consents (the memo attached below contains a summary of such matters).

Mary Cilia and I had worked with Mike Jones (AA) on this a few months ago and he had agreed that we could avoid consolidation of DPC by entering into a legally binding side letter with GE and Bechtel waiving our majority consent rights and agreeing to vote as a block with them on such matters.  AA's concurrence is subject to their review the side letter and confirmation that it is legally binding.

Jeff Sommers and I are scheduling a meeting with Mike Jones for tomorrow to ensure that the previously reached conclusion still stands.

Subject:	Deconsolidation of Dabhol if Enron's shares are increased to 65%

To All -

Attached is the memo documenting our conclusion on the continued deconsolidation of Dabhol if Dabhol Power Company were to issue the Phase II shares that the investors are currently entitled to.  Such an issuance would increase Enron's interest in the company to approximately 65%.  In short, as long as Enron waives its majority consent abilities in a legally binding side letter with GE and Bechtel, we would not have to consolidate Dabhol.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to respond.  Thanks.

Mary

"UH Resume Review and On Campus Interviews","Hi, Jeff.

I have been receiving several inquiries from UH volunteers on the Recruiting List wanting to confirm Nov 12 and 13.  I've been responding that we are waiting to review the resumes to determine the number of people needed to interview and greet.  

Most of the volunteers are Manager and above and need to mark their calendars now to avoid scheduling meetings on those days.  Greeters also need to obtain approval from their managers to take a day off with such short notice.  When do you think we'll know for sure the number of volunteers needed?  Also, do you have a need to review the resumes to select the on campus interview candidates?

Thanks in advance for your help.

"Employee Transfers","Rod,  I wanted to confirm with you that it is OK for us to move certain employees to co. 1202 as of Jan. 1, 2002.  I know that we cannot move all the Service Groups, but you had agreed that we could move all the E&C Employees in Jerry Martin's organization to 1202 and a number of the Ops. Support Services Employees (in Morris's organization) that support all of the pipelines and are NOT mostly dedicated to just one company.

Please confirm so we can work with HR to have these employees moved at year end.

Also, have there been any further updates from regulatory regarding a more encompassing move of employees to one service company?

Thanks,  Elaine

"FERC Contact Re:  Enron Situation Impact on Pipelines","I received a call from Jim Guest at the FERC OCA this afternoon concerning the Enron situation.  He had read the articles and heard the reports.  Wanted to know if bad accounting was the root of the problem.  I advised him that it was bad investments that was the real issue. He asked about the use of the pipeline assets to pull Enron thru the liquidity crisis.  I gave him a brief overview of the Dynegy cash infusion and the bank revolvers.  He said there was some concern at the FERC that projects we might be proposing may not be able to be funded due to the reduced ability of the pipelines to obtain outside financing due to the securitization of the all the assets.  I indicated that it was my opinion that good investments in pipeline facilities would probably be looked on favorably at Enron these days.

Thought you'd want a quick update.  I haven't advised Drew or Greg Porter yet.  Thought you might want to cover with them.

* Who is responsible for managing this process in the business?  
* Does the business review the quality of their social/environmental risk assessment and management activities?
* Is the business unit aware of the existing corporate function and processes?

This information will help Ken and his task team to  develop a proposed process for developing a consistent process for measuring social/environmental risk management performance across the business.  We may be asked for more assistance in this area in 2002.

Subject:	RE: EGS Newsletter

Lets try it and then try to gauge whether it is accomplishing anything.  I believe our employees are on information overload and putting out another newsletter adds to the overload.  I have always believed that if we have an effective Corporate newsletter we don't need these subsidiary newsletters.  Meaningful information can be included in the corporate newsletter.  At ETS we used to have periodic FYI newsletters that were directed at key topics we needed to cover.

You and I also need to do a budget review.  The cost I am hearing from your group are to big for EGS to support.  I had truly hoped that Gina's group combined with you and perhaps one other person could cover EGS.  Gina's group was covering ETs and EOTT.  I think Adam has a PR person so we need to find out what PR costs are in the Wind company.  Also NBP's has there own PR person.

Please set up a meeting with Cindy and Tracy.

Thanks

Subject:	RE: EGS Newsletter

Since this newsletter will be sent via e-mail, there is little non-employee related expense.  We will be using existing staff and making this additional employee communication part of our assignments.  Translations, graphics, web support and printing should collectively be under $10,000 per year. (If a subsidiary decided to copy/reproduce for their hourly employees, they would have additional costs.)
Initially we would shoot for every three to four weeks, but this could change depending on interest and content.
This would not replace any other newsletters, but it might result in less local writing costs or redundant news in the EGS businesses.  We expect that Enron corp. vehicles like eBiz would draw from the newsletter for some of their content for the broader Enron audience.  This may  help in getting EGS employees to see themselves as part of a team rather than assets for sale.
Most of the information in the newsletter would be original. The 13,000 EGS employees can benefit from hearing from their chairman, occasional recognition and learning about other units' activities.  We plan to efficiently use our resources in developing this material, since the same effort will assist us in our necessary preparations for both external and internal audiences. 
We had not done the final check of the businesses and it was an oversight leaving out Brian Stanley's groups.  We will include them.

Are you comfortable with the responses outlined above?   If so, we would like to proceed, but need to  ensure that the approach in the chairman's letter is acceptable to you.  Your comments, when you have time, would be appreciated.

How much does putting out the newsletter cost?  How often are you proposing to put it out?  Does it replace any other newsletters?  Is there any new information in the newsletter or just restatements of what Ken, Mark and Greg have already said?  Need to make sure we have included Brian Stanley's group in what constitutes EGS.  Especially NEPCO.

Subject:	EGS Newsletter

Stan,

With the formation of EGS, as well as all of the recent activity affecting the company, we feel that it is important to initiate an EGS newsletter to keep employees informed and motivated.  The most cost-effective and timely way of doing this is through e-mail, backed up with an intranet version and hard copies (in most cases printed off locally) for those employees who do not have PCs.  The newsletter would supplement other communication channels, such as messages from you, eSpeak, floor meetings, site visits, your periodic meetings and normal management communication.  

We would like to see how much news and interest we have before making a final determination, but would expect this newsletter to go out once or twice a month.  In addition to English, we intend to provide Spanish and Portuguese versions.   We will work to assist local management if they feel that other languages are needed for their operations.

Attached for your review is the proposed text for the first edition.  We believe a message from you and summary of the business units/operations in EGS is the appropriate content for the first edition.  In future editions we would expect to also cover business developments and news of interest to employees.  A template of our proposed design for the newsletter is also attached.  Any comments on the text or concept, as well as your approval to proceed would be greatly appreciated.  Of course, I am available at your convenience if you want to discuss this.

Thank you,

John

How does this look?

 

Also, I did change some numbers in the excel spreadsheet:

	The Ignacio to Blanco subscription levels were pulling from the row excluding ROFR capacity in the supporting sheet.  I changed it to be consistent with the other 	capacities (which include ROFR capacity).

	Shelley had made some assumptions about East of Thoreau capacity subscription, such as, the USGT 400,000/d contract would remain subscribed (it doesn't 	have ROFR) and she had included the extension of 2-3 other contracts that don't have ROFR.  These contracts were then dropped after 2005.  I continued the 	extensions through 2006.

	I changed the East of Thoreau capacity to 750,000/d from 850,000/d.

"Confidential - Decision tree on projects","Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting.

There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaza.  In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the position that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepared to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans.  SECLP has been the biggest issue/problem.  Panama is much less (a few million of floating of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cash crunch in April of this year.  Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully guaranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, BLM.  In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would cause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from the GoPanama.  The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from actions taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with private parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a ""mark"" on the company's liquidity position.  

Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panama or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enron to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence?  The same could go for SECLP and Gaza.

This is simply an overall ""guidance"" question.  Let's take it up during our staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you.

Many thanks, Mariella

P&L  Daily	-111,355.53	
VaR	 441,917.71

Physical deals modelled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged phsycal positions.

VaR is ""Value at Risk"":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance metholodogy, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


NOTE: We are reviewing the modelling of one of the financial deals which may have a significant impact on the numbers reported above.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Rod,

I agree with Kenneth Cessac's response.  We should evaluate our current process for collecting, validating and distributing measurement data and consider new ideas and alternatives to improve the process.  Assistance from a consulting firm that specializes in this area would probably be better than using Rutherford.

Subject:	RE: Need for Rutherford Consulting Complete

This question has been raised several times over the past 10+ years, should we combine GMS, Field Operations, and some of the Gas Control functions to create a single source for measurement data.  I do not feel that changing a reporting relationship would correct any problems.  

I feel the time and effort can e better spent improving our current data collect process and data flow between SCADA and PGAS.  While this process is working I feel that it requires to much manual intervention and handling.  The IT department, Measurement Technology, Gas Control Hot Seat, and the Data Analysis are all involved in keeping the data flowing between SCADA and PGAS.  We should step back and re look and the current process and see what improvements can be made to better control and maintain this process.

 A second area that should be looked at is the data validation process.  Currently Field Operations, Data Analysis, and GMS all  manually review measurement data.  With all of the computer and software technology available I feel that we could easily automate most of the current manual data validation.

I have limited experience with the Rutherford company and what they could provide towards improving these items.  I feel that a company that specializes in SCADA and such as UTSI would be a better option.

Subject:	RE: Need for Rutherford Consullting Complete

The PGAS reporting project recently completed requirements gathering meetings with data users in gas measurement technology, gas control, gms, gas accounting, and gas logistics.  We think, those discussions have pointed to a need to assess inefficiencies that appear to exist related to data integrity as data moves between systems and users that span the entire gas volume/quality collection, transformation and delivery process.  In other words there seem to be too many questions and reconcilliations that people have to address along the process as data changes hands and is used for different internal and external purposes.  There also appears to be a lack of a single point of responsibility in the organization for gas volume data from start to finish.
The PGAS reporting project proposed to assess this at a high level and make some recommendations.  But as important as the issue appears to be, you might want to consider using Rutherford to help ETS do a more thorough job of this.
This effort would extend outside FA&A.
Please advise.

Mike, Ellis and I are in agreement that the need for the Rutherford Consulting group is complete.  Rutherford achieved what their goal was; to provide structure and format for the PGAS issues to be addressed in an efficient manner.  The procedures for listing new issues are in place and are being followed by the team.  The meetings are efficient in that only status updates and priorities are reviewed and discussed. There is now only one list for all issues that are being addressed or need to be addressed and they are prioritized.   The monthly meetings are now only needed twice a month.  What is the procedure for notifying Rutherford that their services are no longer needed on this project as they have completed what was asked of them?   cvb

Steve,

Enron Property Services may need us to move Accounting from the 9th to the 8th floor - this is due to the relocation of personnel from 21&22 to 9&10.  They are to get back to me today or early next week with more details.  Do we know already or would it be possible to expedite the answer to Accounting's long term home from an organizational standpoint?  Depending on the answer maybe it would be possible to move them to their 'final' home now (if it is outside of EEOS) instead of moving them twice.

Please advise,
Marilyn

Hi Rod,

I know you will be looking into cost and support issues relating to the services we get from Enron Global Finance.  I am of the opinion that the dedication of a talented Global Finance professional will provide us with a much better work product (service) at a significantly lower cost, if we can get EGF to allocate 100% of the cost of the employee and eliminate their allocation to us entirely.

I would like to suggest that you consider Dan Castagnola as the dedicated resource.  Not only is Dan very familiar with all or a majority of our projects from both the commercial as well as the finance perspective, but in my experience working with him, he is an extremely creative and talented business person.  I would feel very fortunate to have Dan on my team.

Just a recommendation ... 

Thanks, Mariella

ps: Jeff has worked with Dan so he can also give you his independent perspective.

Carolyn,

Kim is entering the Sept charges this week.  Also, the Oct. will be done by the end of the month.

Due to the length of time it took to obtain the f-02 access, it has taken longer to input the entries. Also, it takes approximately 3 days to have all entries made for one  month.

Jennifer

Jennifer, I spoke with the manager of the Midland team this morning and she is still unable to find any information in her reports about vehicle charges.  She pulled information for September and October for two different locations and these allocations are still not showing up.  Please give me a call so we can discuss the purchasing card allocation file.

thanks

I talked with Sabrina Whaley who is the contact at Enron for this Symposium.  If you signed up prior to two weeks ago, there was a 50% discount off the $950 price.  Both Henry and Sally signed up and got the discount which I confirmed with Sabrina.  If you want to sign up now the price skyrocketed to $1,250 each!  Wow!

If they signed up and cancel now there is no refund, but someone else could go in their place so let them just go.

"Finance Support","Hi Rod,

I know you will be looking into cost and support issues relating to the services we get from Enron Global Finance.  I am of the opinion that the dedication of a talented Global Finance professional will provide us with a much better work product (service) at a significantly lower cost, if we can get EGF to allocate 100% of the cost of the employee and eliminate their allocation to us entirely.

I would like to suggest that you consider Dan Castagnola as the dedicated resource.  Not only is Dan very familiar with all or a majority of our projects from both the commercial as well as the finance perspective, but in my experience working with him, he is an extremely creative and talented business person.  I would feel very fortunate to have Dan on my team.

Just a recommendation ... 

Thanks, Mariella

ps: Jeff has worked with Dan so he can also give you his independent perspective.

"Space Options","As of this morning, the 'executives' are still on schedule to move into the new building on December 14th. 
	Option 1:	Move Stan and Cindy to level 39. 

	Option 2:	Leave Stan and Cindy on 50; Move you, Danny, whomever you and Stan decide to the empty offices on 50.


Also, to consider in an effort to consolidate the Danny McCarty's organization back into more functional environments:

Level 30 is currently being used for Disaster Recovery thru year-end. Levels 31 and 32 are vacant and available to us now. Both floors are high density (trader desks), approximately 280 desks per floor. However, these floors present a problem situation for Shelly et al because of Gas Control location.

Level 44 has high density (188 cubes), and would be the fastest and most economical solution to fit Danny/Shelley groups on one floor in the upper stack. The only down side to this floor is the lack of offices and team rooms -- only 7 offices and 1 large conference room. My uderstanding is that Jim Fallon is planning to consolidate Broadband on level 44. Danny McCarty is calling him to inquire about these plans and to discuss the possibility of relocating them to the 30's bank.

Tracy,

Thank you!  These meetings are very helpful in better understanding the business.  I'm currently scheduled to be in Korea, but may change plans and will let you know.  

By the way, Rod had suggested that I hold off on bothering you about my group's budget until after you complete this enormous endeavor.  However, FYI, I had submitted an approximately $2 million budget through Steve Kean's group and about $300,000 was submitted for Gina Taylor's group in the ETS budget.  I'm probably going to identify some reductions in these numbers.  Please let me know when you need details.

Thanks,

John

EAS reviewed a sample of invoices with company codes altered by the end user prior to coding and approval to ensure that the original invoice dates were maintained.  Our testing showed that the fix was effective and the invoice date did not change after October 10, 2001.  Several other issues were uncovered and are described in the draft report.

Attached please find the draft report detailing the results of our testing. I will contact some of you next week to discuss the recommendations.

Feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns regarding this draft report.
