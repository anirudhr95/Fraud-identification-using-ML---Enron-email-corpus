Please define close?  Also, what is the outstanding issue with Redwood?  Please set up another meeting with a copy of the actual flows to Palo, sales prices, third party deals and an example of an invoice.  I would like to walk through the deal.

I met with Settlements on Friday, and we were relatively close for the August invoice.  The Redwood Gas is an outstanding issue for us and Palo Alto.  When we finished on Friday we left a few action items, but my take on the meeting was that we have the deal in the system in a manner that will flow to the back office groups relatively smoothly.  
 
I will keep you posted.
 
Thanks
 
Anne

I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.   
 
I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.
 
Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.  
 
We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.
 
 
Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.
 
I have a question.  What does the ""Wood"" report mean ?  
 
See you.
 
Anne

Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.
 
Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?
 
Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. 
 
By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early. 
 
Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right?

Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.

On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.

We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal.

Let me know if this clears everything up.  

Thanks 

Anne

We are going to meet up later with his Aunt & Uncle (very fun people) and he and Cher around 9pm.  I have to go to a happy hour for Tosha's departure at 5:30 at Tealas.  You are welcome to come if you like.  

Also, we have been invited to go down to the bay near Galveston and ride Jetskis tomorrow afternoon with LP and Cher.  A guy from Halliburton has a big spread down there and it sounds like fun.  We are planning to go around lunch time.  That is good bc I need to get some stuff done tomorrow around the house.  Are you in??  I hope so.

Kim:

It sounds like there have been some changes in the settlements group that have resulted in a billing error for Smurfit.  My guess is they are using the spreadsheet rather than the SoCal Gas imbalance statement to set the volume.

Can you please check and get back to John?

Subject: Enron Billing



Chris,

Enron may have a new person in charge of SSCC Vernon's account now as there
are billing differences once again. Hannah Nguyen was kind enough to send
SSCC a bill for October 2001 for 68,243 mmbtu's of gas. The sum of the
delivered volumes from Southern California Gas for the accounts SSCC Vernon
is paying for seems to be closer to 108,975. Upon advising Houston of the
additional payment that would be received for the underbilling, SSCC Vernon
received a fax to the effect that actually 109,130 mmbtu's were due.

It may be unclear that SSCC Vernon pays for delivered gas volumes, or the
volumetric information SSCC faxed to Houston may not have been legible. In
any event, attached is the e-file used for the calculation for Enron's
review.

Best regards,
John Ewing

Market Summary (as of 10/18/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Markets lose early momentum
Provided by Briefing.com and MSN Money

Futures pointed to an opening rally, but stocks lost momentum just as the bell rang. Almost simultaneous with the opening bell came news of skin anthrax in an employee in the office of CBS News anchor Dan Rather. Bio-terrorism worries were the biggest reason for stocks' decline on Wednesday.

The torrent of mostly bad news continues: poor earnings, an anthrax-tainted letter in Kenya and another disappointing job-market report.

Already this morning, several more of the Dow 30 have issued their quarterly results. Investors like what they?re hearing from Coke. The company earned 43 cents a share, three cents ahead of forecasts, and says it?s selling more cans of soda at ever higher prices. Shares jumped 2% to 45.15.

The view at other Dow stalwarts is cloudier. Drug giant Merck  lived up to forecasts, but sales growth was weaker than expected; shares fell 2.4% to 67.42. No. 1 car maker General Motors  topped earnings forecasts after excluding special charges, but warned that discount prices and cheap loans to car buyers could hurt results again in the fourth quarter; shares dipped 1.3%. And McDonald's watched its earnings drop 1% from the year-ago quarter; its shares fell 1%.

Two other Dow reports are in the on-deck circle: Boeing any minute and MSN Money parent Microsoft after the closing bell.

<b>All earnings, all the time</b>

Six Dow members represent just the tip of today?s earnings iceberg. Literally hundreds of other companies, big and small, will issue their latest results by the time the sun sets. Find the profit forecasts in our earnings calendar.

Last night, two technology bellwethers in the microchip industry reported. Advanced Micro Devices and Texas Instruments both exceeded profit estimates. But their comments on future business conditions were less than reassuring. (TI financial chief Bill Aylesworth said he can?t predict when his company will be profitable again.) Several analysts quickly lowered 2001 and 2002 earnings forecasts for both companies.

And Merrill Lynch topped earnings estimates but revealed a dismal ? though not unexpected -- sales performance in its brokerage unit. The No. 1 full-service broker is suffering low trading volume and a dismal stock market. It joined its peers in announcing job cuts, 2,300 of them, to be precise.

Market Summary (as of 10/24/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Amazon pounded but market flat
Provided by MSN Money

Amazon is taking a beating today after an unconvincing earnings report, but so far it isn?t taking the market down with it.
<P>
At midday, the Dow is off less than a half-percent after spending most of the morning on the other side of zero. The Nasdaq is up by a fraction, and only real market direction is nowhere fast.
<P>
That?s not true of stocks releasing earnings numbers, who seem to be following those numbers up and down.
<P>
Amazon is off more than 20% after posting a loss that was pretty much as expected. The company again promised profitability, but Wall Street looked at slowing sales and wasn't convinced.
<P>
Sears, meanwhile, saw shares rise (though only a bit) after reporting a rise in profits and announcing plans to restructure and cut 22% of its workforce.

Market Summary (as of 11/19/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Dow turns bullish
Provided by MSN Money

The Dow pushed its way into official bull market territory this morning, up some 20% from its recent lows, notes CNBC's Joe Kernen. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq tagged along, both climbing this morning. The story is similar overseas, with stocks in London, Hong Kong and Japan higher. <P>
The news this morning was only mildly positive, which apparently is all it takes for the market these days. October housing starts fell, but not as much as expected. Home improvement retailer Lowe's topped expectations. And two oil companies are merging. But the employment outlook remains lousy.

Friend,
When you are sad... I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the sorry bastard who made you sad.

When you are blue... I'll try to dislodge whatever is choking you.

When you smile...
I'll know you finally got laid.

When you are scared...
I will rag you about it every chance I get.

When you are worried...
I will tell you horrible stories about how much worse it could be and to
quit whining.

When you are confused...
I will use little words to explain it to your dumb ass.

When you are sick...
Stay away from me until you're well again. I don't want whatever you
have.

When you fall...
I will point and laugh at your clumsy ass.

This is my oath, I pledge 'til the end. Why you may ask? Because you're
my friend!

Send this poem to ten of your closest friends and get depressed because
you realize you only have 2 friends, and one of them is not speaking to
you
right now anyway.

AND REMEMBER, A friend will help you move.

A really good friend will help you move a body.


Go Yankees!

OK, just talked to LP

We are going to meet up later with his Aunt & Uncle (very fun people) and he and Cher around 9pm.  I have to go to a happy hour for Tosha's departure at 5:30 at Tealas.  You are welcome to come if you like.  

Also, we have been invited to go down to the bay near Galveston and ride Jetskis tomorrow afternoon with LP and Cher.  A guy from Halliburton has a big spread down there and it sounds like fun.  We are planning to go around lunch time.  That is good bc I need to get some stuff done tomorrow around the house.  Are you in??  I hope so.

"Manuf. Production/Contrl Software For $1,495.00!","(JM1025)Job Master, a complete, user friendly Windows based software package, can manage and control your operation from sales quote to shipment.

For one week only, Job Master, normally $2,495.00, is on sale for a total price of $1,495.00.  In order for you to receive this $1,000.00 savings we must have your order by October 31.

(To reply by E Mail to this message or be removed from our list, Please go to the bottom of this message for an E Mail link.)

Job Master is designed specifically for small to medium sized manufacturers, and costs many thousands of dollars less than any other even remotely comparable software package.

Following is a list of features. If you have any questions, would like to discuss the package further, or if you would like to obtain our Web site address for a total walk through of the program, please call me directly at (661) 286-0041.

By way of background, we are a software company, which for some years has specialized in the development of custom software, primarily for small to medium sized manufacturers.  Job Master is a distillation of over a million and a half dollars of software we have developed to control and manage the production of our manufacturing clients.

Job Master contains the following features:

1. QUOTATION MODULE.  In this module, quotes are developed, modified, and produced for sending to your client.  A history is kept of all quotes for future reference, or modification for other clients.  All quotations and revisions are ""auto numbered,"" including versions.  The quotes section allows for the entry of parts/processes, and costing of each, including materials, labor, markup, and taxes.  Inventory status can be accessed from this section for reference.

2. SALES ORDER.  Once a quotation is accepted, the final quotation information can be transformed into a Sales Order for your client's signature on a ""point and click"" basis.  The Sales Order can be modified and re issued if necessary.  A history if kept of all Sales Orders for future reference, or modification for other clients.  All sales orders and revisions are ""auto numbered,"" including versions.  Inventory status can be accessed from this section for reference.

3. CUSTOMER LETTERS can be created from the Quotation and Sales Order sections.

4. SHOP TRAVELER/WORK ORDER.  Once a Sales Order is accepted, the sales order information can be transformed into a shop traveler/work order on a ""point and click"" basis.  Each item on the Sales Order becomes a shop traveler/work order, with each step of production of the item then listed on the traveler/work order.  Each such traveler/work order is tied back into the Sales Order.  The shop traveler/work order allows for the entry of line items, and notes on each line item. The shop traveler/work order contains a ""notes"" section.  The Shop traveler/work order allows for the storing or attachment of drawings to the traveler/work order.  The shop traveler/work order also contains a ""drop down,"" from which standard processes can be selected for inclusion on the shop traveler/work order.  The shop traveler/work order numbers progress in order of production sequence, and re numbers them if new steps are added.  The shop traveler/work order allows for change orders or revisions, a!
nd numbers changes in sequence of the original shop traveler/work order number; i.e., 100, 100-1, 100-2, etc.  All shop traveler/work orders and related revisions are retained in memory for future reference.  The shop traveler/work order is bar coded for tracking of production step by step, and production of ongoing client status reports.  Bar coding includes the ability for an employee to ""swipe"" their own ID bar code for recording in the system as to who upgraded what step.  The shop traveler/work order function also allows for manual update of production status.  The shop traveler/work order allows for quality control sign off, and the final production of certifications, either from a ""canned"" list, or hand typed in on a case by case basis.

5. INVENTORY.  The application includes an inventory section, which allows operations to check materials inventory in and out.  The inventory section allows for the comparison of inventory received against a P.O., and produces an ""overage/underage"" report of inventory received as compared against the P.O.  The inventory section allows for the setting of minimum (re-order now!) and maximum inventory amounts, and produces reports showing what inventory needs to be ordered, as well as inventory that is at or above the maximum set to have in house.   The inventory section also tracks ""partially shipped"" orders, which are tied in to the shipping function.  This section shows how much completed product under a particular order has been actually shipped to a client, and how much remains to be shipped.  The balance is adjusted as shipments are made.

6. REQUEST FOR PURCHASE.  The application allows operators to produce a Request For Purchase for accounting for any inventory items, which need to be ordered.  Inventory items have a drop down of approved vendors for each item.

7. REQUEST FOR BID.   The application allows operators to produce a Request For Bid for accounting to send to Vendors for any inventory items, which need to be ordered.  Inventory items have a drop down of approved vendors for each item to which Requests For Bid can be sent.

8. INVOICE.  The application produces an invoice/invoice detail for all completed items ready to be billed/shipped to clients.

9. PRODUCTION OUTPUT STATUS.  The application produces a date range selectable report on how much product, and the value of the product, which was completed during a selected date range.  The application also produces a report on how many orders, and the value of those orders, which remain to be completed during a selected date range.

10. The application produces SHIPPING DOCUMENTS as per selected shippers, and produces a PACKING SLIP.

11. The application has a ""FIND"" FUNCTION in selected sections, allowing for searches by customer name, work order number, etc.

12. The application has ""AUTO FILL;"" i.e., when an operator starts to type in a name, number, etc. all related information auto fills after the first few letters or numbers are typed in.

Job Master is currently being sold in the marketplace for $2,495.00 per package.  However, if we receive your order by October 31, your total price will be $1,495.00

Again, if you have any questions at all, or would like to place your order, please call me on my direct line, (661) 286-0041.  Thank you!

Talked to them this morning and refreshed the basis numbers down a bit.  Told them about the LC requirements and they puked but didn't say that it was over.  If this deal doesn't get done today, it won't get done because we will have to add them to our Socal Pool on Monday.  Any room on the LC's?  They asked.  I think if we didn't ask them to post, they would do the deal.

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

FYI, We are addressing this today.  Grigsby knows they are pissed and he knows that I am pissed.  If they expect me to continue to sell products involving service from their desk, and they get paid for that service, they are going to have to do a better job.  Citizens isn't the only one that I feel has service issues from the desk.

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

Market Summary (as of 10/25/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Tech leads market down
Provided by MSN Money

This was supposed to be a big day for technology companies. And it is turning into a big day on Wall Street, but a big day the wrong way.
<P>
The Dow is off more than 150 points, or 2%, and the Nasdaq off about 2.5%, at 11 a.m., while the technology indexes are getting hammered. The Amex Networking Index is off almost 4%, the key semiconductor index is off about the same and the Amex computer technology index is off 3%.
<P>
Most notably, Microsoft is down 2% this morning, just as the company releases its much-touted Windows XP operating system. (Microsoft is the parent of MSN Money.) The software has been widely praised, but will users rush in to pay $100 or more to upgrade to it? Investors, at least, don't seem to think so.
<P>
If there's doubt that software at a couple hundred bucks will move in this economy, there's even more about computers at a couple thousand.
<P>
Computer makers have also long been expecting a rush as users trade in their four and five-year-old systems for gadgets that will run XP. But makers like Compaq, Dell Computer and Gateway are all getting blasted this morning.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"NEW! Dispatchable Generation Product for New York","
---------------------- Forwarded by Suzanne Vann/HOU/EES on 10/16/2001 01:36 PM ---------------------------


EES Product Announcement
10/16/2001 10:42 AM
Sent by:	Kathleen Pope-Sance
To:	All EES
cc:	 
Subject:	NEW! Dispatchable Generation Product for New York


Introducing a product that allows customers to create revenue 
using their emergency power generators.

Many Enron commodity customers have emergency power generators that normally sit idle. But with our new 
Dispatchable Generation Program, our customers can turn their power generators into revenue generators. Enron 
monitors the wholesale power market, and when prices spike, we notify our customers to operate their on-site
generators. The power they generate displaces a portion of the load we would normally supply. We then 
sell that displaced power on the wholesale market--where the prices are high--and share the revenue 
with the customer. Want to learn more? Click here .

Sorry I didn't forwarn you so you could choose to re-schedule.  Funny how
things can change in just one week!  Suzanne is awesome - don't know what I
would do without her.  We just went to Berryhill and had a taco and
margarita.  Not a late night.  You didn't have to leave - I am glad you
came though.  Hope we can do it again sometime - once I get over this hump.
(See, I am still insecure and a disaster when it comes to relationships!
and I hadn't even gone there in 5 years!)

Take care and keep in touch.

where will you be coming from?

If you go south on Kirby, turn left and travel west on Richmond.  Take the
first right onto Lake street.  Go through the first stop sign and I am
behind the black iron gate on your left.  My address is 3110 Lake and I am
behind 3112 Lake.  Park on the street.  If the car gate is closed, the
people gate code is c1984.

See you then -

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Fascism
You have two cows.
The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you the
milk.

Pure Communism
You have two cows.
Your neighbors help take care of them and you all share the milk.

----------

Applied Communism
You have two cows.
You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.

----------

Totalitarianism
You have two cows.
The government takes them both and denies they ever existed.
Milk is banned.

----------

Pure Democracy
You have two cows.
You and your neighbors decide who gets the milk.

Representative Democracy
You have two cows.
Your neighbors pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.

----------

Mexican Democracy
You have two cows.
The government takes both and drafts you into the army.

----------

European Democracy
You have two cows.
The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply.
If there aren't any, they invent some.
They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the
drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.

----------

American Democracy
The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.
After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow
futures.
The press dubs the affair ""cowgate,"" but supports the president.
The cows sue you for breach of contract.
Your legal bills exceed your annual income.
You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy.

Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows.
You sell them and retire on the income.

----------

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a
debt/equity
swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back,
with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are
transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned
by
the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to
your
listed company.  The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with
an
option on one more.

Talked to them this morning and refreshed the basis numbers down a bit.  Told them about the LC requirements and they puked but didn't say that it was over.  If this deal doesn't get done today, it won't get done because we will have to add them to our Socal Pool on Monday.  Any room on the LC's?  They asked.  I think if we didn't ask them to post, they would do the deal.

Also, we have been invited to go down to the bay near Galveston and ride Jetskis tomorrow afternoon with LP and Cher.  A guy from Halliburton has a big spread down there and it sounds like fun.  We are planning to go around lunch time.  That is good bc I need to get some stuff done tomorrow around the house.  Are you in??  I hope so.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

"Who would you rather have on YOUR team?","
		[IMAGE]	
[IMAGE]	 So, is EVERYTHING suddenly all about Michael? ESPN users are grabbing  Kevin Garnett  as the consensus # 1 pick.  Shaq  simultaneously gives you the best FG% and the worst FT% in the league. And it was Ray Allen  who was the highest rated Fantasy player last year. So we ask you...  Who would you rather have on YOUR team?   And that's the beauty of Fantasy Basketball . Just like the make-or-break dilemmas faced by owners, GMs and head coaches in the NBA, YOU make the tough decisions when building your FBA team.  But like that 40-foot heave with time running out, ESPN answers the call when you need them most -- supplying you with all the team-building tools of the trade for an upstart GM. So suddenly, it's all up to you .  	 [IMAGE]  ? Fantasy Basketball Index  ? 2002 Player Rankings  ? 2001 Final Player Ratings  ? Average Draft Picks  ? Most Added/Dropped  ?

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

"90% REDUCTION IN CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME => TORBAY HOLDINGS INC. (TRBY)","
[IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE]  As  a courtesy to our sponsors, who enable EquityAlert.com to  provide you with FREE news alerts, we respectfully ask that you view the following advertisement  at your convenience.       90% REDUCTION IN CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME   TORBAY HOLDINGS INC. (TRBY)          Today?s  Special Situations Alert presents Torbay Holdings,  Inc. (OTC BB: TRBY) ? bringing innovative products  to the marketplace.       Heralded  as the next generation in mouse technology, TRBY?s  KAT Computer Mouse design has been proven in clinical  studies to reduce carpal nerve extension ?  the action that results in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome ?  from 11% to less than 1%, a 90% reduction!       An  estimated 65% of industry related injury claims are  due to Repetitive Strain Syndrome, of which Carpal Tunnel  Syndrome is a significant part ? representing significant  opportunity for TRBY.      [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]     Torbay's  KAT Catches Media, Investor Attention    NEW  YORK, Nov 8, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- After announcing its  acquisition of the groundbreaking KAT(SM) computer mouse,  Torbay Holdings, Inc. (OTC:BB,TRBY), has received a favorable  response from the media and investing community. Tom Large,  Torbay CEO, was recently interviewed for a CEOcast profile  http://www.ceocast.com ). Further, the company has been the  recipient of strong interest from a major New York investment  firm, with discussions continuing.     The  KAT's medically conceived ergonomic design has been hailed  as a breakthrough in computer mouse technology. It has been  proven in clinical studies to alleviate carpal tunnel syndrome,  a common workplace injury resulting from computer use. Given  that over half of all worker injury claims are related to  Repetitive Strain Syndrome, of which carpal tunnel syndrome  is a significant part, the implications for appreciably  reducing worker injury claims is significant.  CEO  Tom Large stated: ""I am pleased with the response to  our announcement, as we are about to commence a major promotional  campaign. If the reaction to date reflects future interest,  then Torbay should very quickly begin to see its full value  realized.""  Outlets  for the manufacture and distribution of the KAT have been  established in the US, Europe and the Far East, with official  production dates to be announced in the near future.

Market Summary (as of 11/26/2001 12:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Recession official, but stocks flat
Provided by MSN Money

So now it's official. The United States is in a recession, one that began in March 2001 and was only worsened by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
<P>
So says the Business Cycle Dating Committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research, which gets to decide such things. No real surprise on Wall Street, but enough to turn the Dow and S&P around and turn early gains into losses.
<P>
The Nasdaq, though, stayed positive, driven by tech and in particular chip stocks. And at midday, all three major indexes are within 1% of even.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

"NOAA Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index (REDTI)","NOAA ANNOUNCES NEW ""ENVIRONOMICS"" PROGRAM THAT 
LINKS WEATHER, CLIMATE TO ECONOMY
Data Show Effect of Climate Conditions on Corn and Soybean Yield
and Residential Energy Needs
October 24, 2001 - NOAA <http://www.noaa.gov/> today unveiled two new indices that evaluate the effect of climate conditions on corn and soybean yield and on residential energy needs. The development of the indices is part of NOAA's ""Environomics"" program <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/environomics/environomics.html>, an effort to better understand the impact of weather and climate on socioeconomic sectors of the nation. The indices were developed by NOAA's National Climatic Data Center <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html> in Asheville, N.C., which maintains the world's largest weather database. (Click NOAA image for larger view of standardized temperature index for Sept. 2001.)
Anecdotal statements about the weather are often used to explain variations in economic activity, and these statements are often based on perceptions about the weather that may or may not be valid. Through NOAA's Environomics program, relationships between the nation's climate and vital economic sectors of the nation are clearly defined using climate indices, which enhance the understanding of how year-to-year variations and trends in weather and climate affect associated sectors.
Thomas Karl <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/about/welcomefromdirector.html>, director of NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, said, ""Climate indices developed through the Environomics program provide quantitative information regarding climate's influence while providing historical perspective on how weather and climate conditions affecting our economy and society today compare with conditions of the past.""
The period of high energy demand and prices of the late 1970s coincided with extremely cold winters that contributed to higher residential energy usage. The Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index (REDTI), which provides information related to climate sensitive residential energy demand, reflects this increased demand through historically high index values and can be used in part to explain the cause of the historically high energy demand of that time. By providing continuing updates to the index, a clearer understanding of future fluctuations in energy demand will be possible.
The REDTI tracks both unusually hot and unusually cold conditions. It varies from year to year due to variability and trends in temperature, and it responds most strongly to temperature conditions in heavily populated regions. REDTI values range from 0 to 100. Values greater than 90 indicate a much above average temperature-related energy demand and values less than 10 reflect much below average conditions.
The REDTI for the 2001 April-September season was 34, indicative of slightly below average residential energy demand for cooling and heating. Based on the 107 year record, the population-weighted REDTI value of 34 ranks as the 19th lowest value.
The nation's warm season (April-September) 2001 ranked as the fourth warmest such period since 1895, the first year of complete climate records. The preliminary national average temperature was 67.4 F (19.7 C), which was 1.6 F (0.9 C) above the long-term mean. Although the area-weighted national temperature gave the season a rank of fourth warmest on record, the persistence of average to cooler than average temperatures in some of the most heavily populated regions of the U.S. contributed to a REDTI that was below average. Energy usage statistics for 2001 will be available from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration in 2002.
While the REDTI provides information on the impacts of temperature on energy demand, the Moisture Stress Index (MSI), was developed to quantify the effect of soil moisture conditions on crop yield. It provides historical perspective on conditions such as moisture stress, that are closely associated with corn and soybean yields and is a source of information for explaining the cause of lower national yields.
The MSI ranges from zero to 100 and specifically measures the proportion of the nation's corn or soybeans affected by severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness. Values near zero indicate that few productive corn or soybean growing areas were affected by severe drought or catastrophic wetness. This index reflects conditions during July and August and is weighted by the mean (1991-2000) annual crop productivity within 344 climate divisions in the contiguous U.S. Although a number of factors affect the success of a single crop growing season, drought or excessive wetness during critical phases of crop growth have a significant impact on the nation's corn and soybean yield.
Although warmer than average temperatures coincided with drought in some parts of the country during the warm season months of 2001, conditions in the heart of the major corn and soybean crop growing regions were generally normal to wetter than normal. The corn MSI for the 2001 crop growing season was eight, and the soybeans MSI was seven. This means that severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness affected only 8 percent and 7 percent of the nation's corn and soybeans, respectively. Both index values were below average and reflect favorable soil moisture throughout a large part of the crop growing regions during July and August (the reproductive season).
The MSI for corn exceeded 40 during the drought-plagued growing seasons of 1983 and 1988 and 30 during the catastrophically wet summer of 1993, years in which corn yields were less than 75 percent of the 2000 yield. The 2001 growing season (May-September) followed several years in which national corn and soybean yields were generally high, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The low values of this year's corn and soybean MSI indicate that conditions associated with this index were again favorable for good corn and soybean yields. National crop yields for 2001 will be available from the United States Department of Agriculture following the harvest season.
NOAA is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction and research of weather and climate-related events and providing environmental stewardship of our nation's coastal and marine resources.

Market Summary (as of 11/21/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Market sinks into red
Provided by MSN Money

Go ahead, take off early.
<p>
That seems to be Wall Street's attitude today, even though the Thanksgiving holiday is a day away. In what promises to be a quiet session, the major indexes started the day down, despite a better-than-expected jobless claims report. That, and an uptick in consumer-sentiment numbers, lifted stocks -- but only briefly.
<p>
There is a bit of business to be taken care of, however, before we turn to gorging on turkey and sweet potatoes:  First, weekly jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week, Reuters reports.
<P>
In the week ended Nov. 17, new jobless claims fell by a seasonally adjusted 15,000 to 427,000. A Reuters' survey had forecast 461,000 jobless claims.
<P>
The second bit of business: Consumer sentiment rose in November, Reuters reports, as hopes for an economic recovery next year overshadowed worries about lost jobs and recession. The University of Michigan's index rose for a second straight month to 83.9 in November from 82.7 in October. That was higher than consensus forecasts.

I knew approximately where the ball entered, but because of the new fluffy sand, there was no obvious entry mark.  Questions: Am I allowed to probe in any way for the buried ball? Is it considered a lost ball, even though I know its location within 2 feet? If I can't probe, and therefore can't locate the ball I know is THERE, what is the penalty and what are my options?

Market Summary (as of 12/31/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Quiet start for 2001 finale
Provided by MSN Money

A quiet session dawns as investors complete the worst stock-market year since the 1970s. The motivations to head home early seem to outweigh any inclination to trade. Exchanges closed for the day in Japan and most of Europe, the U.S. bond market wraps up at 1 p.m. ET and tomorrow, of course, is the New Year?s holiday.
<p>
Volume could be light today, CNBC?s Mary Thompson reports from the lightly staffed New York Stock Exchange.
<p>
Stocks started very slightly lower, despite a rise in futures before the opening bell. Consumer-products stocks, biotech firms and waste-management companies posted the biggest early declines -- though each sector was down less than 3% on the day.
<p>
Regardless of today's activity, 2001 will wind up a dismal stock-market year. The S&P 500 index, down about 12% in the past 12 months, will post its worst annual drop since 30% in 1974. And the Dow industrials will wrap up their first back-to-back yearly losses since 1977-78. Stocks have come back strongly since mid-September -- but not nearly enough to buff out the damage of the previous nine months.

How Enron Blew It

Texas Monthly

November 2001

Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

by Mimi Swartz <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>

THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""

For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.

This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""

The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.

Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.

ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron. 

From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me."" 

He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""

PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?

But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.

HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""

Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started. 

LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985. 

It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.

Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""

The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""

Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.

 

THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""

Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 

You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)

For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""

Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 

And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).

But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.

""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?

But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.

There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""

Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 

While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.

As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.

And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.

Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.

In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""

BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""

To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.

But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.

Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 

But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 

As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.

ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.

Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")

But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.

Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""

The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""

This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 

Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""

As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""

That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.

But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""

Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.

""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""  <outbind://13/Image2.gif>

Well they just cancelled my B-737 training that I was scheduled for on
Thanksgiving. Had started class last Sunday but suddenly they cancelled DFW
737 base flying. Thought it might be a little late to schedule our
Thanksgiving for the homeless strays.  Let me know a head count if we need
to do this.  Looks like I am one of the strays this year!

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Market Summary (as of 11/20/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Market slips lower
Provided by MSN Money

Forget the bulls and bears. So far today, the blahs are in charge.
<P>
The Big 3 indexes have been in the red most of the morning, but all by less than 1% with relatively few shares changing hands.
<P>
So far, the much-anticipated run to Dow 10,000 -- so tantalizingly close after Monday's close, hasn't materialized. Perhaps a late-day run is in the works. Or perhaps the l-triptophan is kicking in a little early this Thanksgiving week.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"Update From American Airlines","Dear Kimberly Ward,
I promised to keep you informed and wanted to provide an update on the situation surrounding Flight 587. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation is still underway, with both the cockpit voice and flight data recorders being analyzed for clues about the cause of the accident.
In addition to our normal aircraft inspection program, and as purely a precautionary measure, we have begun a voluntary inspection of all tail fins on the Airbus A300 fleet.  The inspection process started on Thursday and should be concluded next week. We have completed approximately 25% of the inspections. While we don't anticipate any problems, we certainly want to look at any and all possibilities for the accident's cause.  When the inspection is finished we will communicate those results.
On behalf of all of us at American Airlines, I want to thank everyone for the outpouring of support we've received following Monday's tragedy. We are heartened by the many notes of care and concern. The unprecedented actions over the past 60 days have tested the entire nation in a way that could not be envisioned prior to September 11. 
I hope that you find these communications informative. It is my pledge to you to keep you informed of not only issues surrounding the accident but also security and airport process measures that we are implementing across our system.
On behalf of the 100,000 employees at American, TWA and American Eagle, thanks for your support.
Sincerely, 
Mike Gunn
Executive Vice President
American Airlines

Click here   [IMAGE]  Golf Quote of the week ""No amount of eccentric implement will make a bad putter putt better."" W.T. Linskill    [IMAGE]  Golf Trivia of the Week ""The Stymie ""  The stymie was really born by default. In the original rules of 1744 only when balls were touching could one be lifted. A stymie could only happen in match play singles or foursomes. On the putting green, if two players' balls were more than six inches apart, there was no provision for the ball nearer the hole to be lifted. If that ball lay directly in the way to the hole of the ball to be played then the player was 'stymied.'  He could try to play around or over the interfering ball, but if the nearer ball was struck, no penalty ensued. However, the opponent had the option of playing the ball as it lay or replacing it. If the nearer ball had been knocked into the hole the opponent was considered to have holed out with his previous stroke.   In 1984, Rule 22, Ball Interfering with or Assisting Play, declared that a ball may be lifted if it may interfere with or assist another player in all forms of play, finally removing the last vestige of the stymie after 240 years.

He dug in pretty well (even the commentator on CBS noted it), was ready to hit, then he backed out, looked again at the pin and settled into his deep foot prints in the bunker. Shouldn't he have been assessed a one stroke penalty (Rule 13)?  I was taught a few rules in bunker play: 1) No practice swings 2) Cannot ground your club 3) Once you take your stance in the trap, you are addressing the ball. It is item 3 that would cause the penalty here (addressing his ball).  Please explain why there was no penalty and how us amateurs should be approaching our bunker shots.

could walk over to Bouray's or something if you're short on time, otherwise
I was thinking about driving over to Vincent's.  Let me know.

"Enron Wire Articles","04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a ""material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" it warned.

19:23 19Nov2001 RSF-Enron sounds debt alarm, reduces reported earnings

    By C. Bryson Hull
    HOUSTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Humbled energy giant Enron Corp. <ENE.N> on Monday warned that it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt by next week and reduced its already-abysmal third-quarter earnings.
    The Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on Monday with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Among the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week.   That marked the start of a nine-day period that expires on Nov. 26, during which Enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships.
    If not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash.
    The company is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat.
    Enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share. The move reflects adjustments made after the quarter's end, Enron said.
    On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001. On Nov 8, Enron said it had restated earnings for 1997-2000 and that net income for the four-year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported.
    It also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust.
    Such an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and ""would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" the company wrote.
    Enron had released those figures earlier, but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability.
    CREDIT COULD BE A KILLER
    Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for Enron to ""Baa3"" and ""BBB-minus,"" just one notch above ""junk"" status. Each warned it may cut its respective ratings again. Moody's also cut Enron's short-term debt rating, which affects  commercial paper, to ""Not Prime,"" a junk rating.
    In nearly all of its partnership deals, Enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue Enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels. At the close of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were at $9.06 - well below the trigger prices.
    All of the partnerships, which Enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet, have become the once-proud company's bane. The SEC is investigating potential conflict-of-interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow served as general partner.
    Enron had to extract itself from those partnerships, which led to a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity.
    The revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory, leaving Enron to be bought on Nov. 9 by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N> for the fire-sale price of $9 billion in stock.
    In an unusual note, Enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant, per SEC regulations, because of ""the need of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditors, to complete their review procedures.""
    Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion.

Attached is a spreadsheet that Karla from Palo Alto sent me.  I don't know if it is different or the same as what you have.  If we have the same discrepancies, lets discuss with Daniel and then, perhaps, Palo.  Let's do so this a.m.

Market Summary (as of 10/22/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Early surge gives way to caution
Provided by MSN Money

The markets are up but just barely this morning, as cautious investors await a flood of earnings news and expect most to be bad.
<P>
The market opened lower but rallied on good news from the semiconductor sector, with a report of cost-cutting plans at giant <B>Intel</B>. The stock was up about 3.5% this morning, and the key semiconductor sector index was up by about the same amount.
<P>
Investors also decided they like the numbers from 3M</B>, which reported a 21% decline in earnings this quarter, but also posted earnings of  $1.10 per share. 3M shares were trading up about 3%.
<P>
But there was plenty of bad news as well, and by noon EST, the surge had leveled off as the market awaited more earnings numbers this afternoon.

Market Summary (as of 12/27/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

The rally rolls on
Provided by MSN Money

Stocks rose at the opening bell in very light trading as investors shook off a spate of bad news from around the globe: heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, deepening economic strife in Argentina, more depressing numbers from Japan. <P>
Among the best-performing sectors in early trading were specialty retailers, power generators, network builders and entertainment companies. Chip stocks rose, primarily on the back of a 5% gain in Advanced Micro Devices, reportedly in line for a big contract from Samsung.
<P>
Oil companies, pharmaceutical firms and beverage stocks suffered light selling.
<P>
A very similar setup welcomed Wednesday?s post-Christmas trading. Extremely light trading volume -- yesterday was the lightest yet this year -- tends to raise volatility.

All are seasoned clinicians.  I've had good reports from persons that have been to see them.  If the arrangment works well for you here, let me know.  In any event the sessions from this point carry a $20 co-pay.  Insurance picks up the rest.  Let me know who you schedule an appointment with and I will get the authorization for the first 6  visits.  Subsequent visits will be authorized by the provider.

where will you be coming from?

If you go south on Kirby, turn left and travel west on Richmond.  Take the
first right onto Lake street.  Go through the first stop sign and I am
behind the black iron gate on your left.  My address is 3110 Lake and I am
behind 3112 Lake.  Park on the street.  If the car gate is closed, the
people gate code is c1984.

See you then -

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Market Summary (as of 10/26/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Bulls keep market rising
Provided by MSN Money

This time, the bulls didn't sleep in. Stocks slumped only momentarily this morning before showing into the black and seem poised to end an up-week with another positive day.
<P>
At midday, the Nasdaq sits about even but the Dow is up another 60 points and quickly closing in on its levels of Sept. 10 -- the day before the terrorist attacks that sent Wall Street and the economy into a tailspin.
<P>
If the Dow can cross 9,605, it will pass that level for the first time since the attacks.
<P>
One factor driving the rise: a good report on consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, showing a slight uptick in the second half of October. It wasn't much, but a day after the market brushed off three bleak economic reports, it may have been enough to keep the rally going.

Market Summary (as of 10/23/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Good news lifts market
Provided by MSN Money

Tough to tell when the good news will outweigh the bad this earnings season, but that's exactly what it happening this morning.
<P>
Amid a stream of earnings reports good and bad, the Dow is holding on to gains of about 0.5% and the Nasdaq is up about 1.5%.
<P>
Investors lifted stocks early after DaimlerChrysler, Blockbuster, Pharmacia and AT&T Wireless all topped profit expectations -- or at least reported smaller-than-expected losses.
<P>
That seemed to impress investors more than disappointments from Exxon Mobil and Lucent Technologies.

Kim -
Attached is a workbook with tabs reflecting the August 2001 Palo Alto calculation, Enron calculation and the manual invoice we sent to Palo Alto.  I will fax you the Enron Unify invoice and supply verification.  We met with Anne Bike to go over the deals and the Palo Alto calculation prior to forwarding the manual invoice.  We are now in the process of trying to get the deal correct in Sitara and Unity.  Please review and let me know when you are ready to discuss and how you want to go forward.

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any

"Texas Monthly November 2001: How Enron Blew It","A bit dramatic, but a good story nonetheless.
--------------------------



Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron. 
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me."" 
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started. 
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985. 
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 
You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.
""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.
""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

"PENDING MERGER EXPECTED TO INCREASE REVENUES BY OVER 500% => NEW CENTURY COMPANIES (NCNY)","
[IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE]    PENDING MERGER EXPECTED TO INCREASE REVENUES BY OVER 500%  NEW CENTURY COMPANIES (NCNY)           Today?s  Special Situations Alert presents New Century Companies  (OTC BB: NCNY).      NCNY  is a manufacturer of precision quality machine tools  (a $30 billion dollar market) utilized in the production  of large diameter precision components for the aerospace  and energy industries.      NCNY?s  pending merger with Smith West Inc., a manufacturer  of machined components for jet engines, turbines for  power generation plants and machinery for the semi-conductor  industry, will add up to $50 million in annual revenues,  compared to $7.4 million last year ? an increase  of over 500%. (see June 29/01 press release)     [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]     New  Century Companies, Inc. Receives Additional New Power Generation  And Defense Industry Orders   Los Angeles, Nov. 19 /PRNewswire/ -- New Century Companies,  Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: NCNY) announced today that it had  received additional orders from a major Power Generation and  Defense Industry player, directly on the heels of the previous  orders announced on October 17, 2001.     ""Our  manufacturing capabilities and track record, have placed  us on the radar screen of almost every major power generation  and defense industry company,"" remarked David Duquette,  CEO of New Century Companies, Inc. ""As the economy  begins breaking out of this recession we are seeing an influx  of business from these fast growing industries. New Century  has also benefited from the departure of competition that  was unable to meet the challenges of the slowed economy.  Our order flow and backlog makes us confident that we are  poised for material growth over this next fiscal year and  beyond.""  The  company is currently in negotiations for additional transactions  and anticipates closing more deals prior to the year-end.  About  New Century Companies, Inc.  New  Century, under its brand name Century Turn, specializes  in manufacturing, remanufacturing and retrofitting machine  tools, primarily Vertical Boring Mills and large Turning  Lathes. New Century is assisting in solving the current  power crisis. By offering remanufactured Vertical Boring  Mills, the company saves or conserves millions of dollars  per year in energy cost by re-utilizing the major castings  of each Vertical Boring Mill. These savings, generally in  the range of 40 to 60%, allow New Century to be the most  price competitive manufacturer of Vertical Boring Mills  in the U.S. These cost savings are passed on to New Century  customers and afford them the opportunity to manufacture  rotating turbine components for power generation at better  costs.  New  Century machines are also used by manufacturers of jet engine  components, airplane landing gear parts, oil and gas components,  to name a few. New Century currently manufactures its machines  in state-of-the art facilities in Santa Fe Springs, CA.  New Century maintains a website at www.newcenturyinc.com   .

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Rob, 

I have passed your resume on to Barry and to Frank Vickers, who is Barry's equivalent for the East and Central desks.  I hope you hear from one of them - Frank is an awesome guy and I would work for him anywhere! I will keep you posted as I hear of other opportunies you might be interested in.  

I will do whatever I can to take care of Robbie Mac!

Kim, 

How's the hiring climate over in Barry's world?  The future here in broadband obviously is bleak.  I'm trying to generate job leads at a company that is quickly shrinking.  Not an enviable position.  

Attached is a resume.  Any inquiries on my behalf are appreciated. As for added comments to hiring people: although I've spent my entire 2 1/2 year Enron career at EBS, I've been in trading, structuring, and origination roles the entire time. I can model and sell w/ the best of them.  I also know Jean Mrha and Tom Gros well. (If that's worth anything.)

Any help is much appreciated. 

Thanks

-Rob
